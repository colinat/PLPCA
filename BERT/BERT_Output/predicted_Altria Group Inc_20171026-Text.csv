74,"I guess the only thing I'd add to that, Vivien, has been that the wholesalers have strategies around when they build their inventory in, when they decide to take their inventory down, which they're free, of course, to do",1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.004,0.015,0.021,0.04,0.035,0.009,0.019,0.017,0.004,0.024,0.811,0.227,0.638,0.135,0.299,0.013,0.526,0.161
75,So I'm glad we're going to see you next week and we are going to talk about Marlboro in some detail there,1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.008,0.016,0.009,0.034,0.009,0.004,0.011,0.007,0.003,0.272,0.627,0.01,0.858,0.131,0.259,0.005,0.69,0.046
76,"I think what we would say is you have to assess it in the context of the strategy, which is to maximize income",1-Neutral,3-Uncertain,0.006,0.085,0.087,0.054,0.025,0.009,0.02,0.022,0.007,0.042,0.644,0.008,0.953,0.039,0.089,0.016,0.11,0.785
77,"And so when we look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level, despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that; we don't do it for competitive reasons",1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.009,0.094,0.065,0.009,0.089,0.071,0.033,0.034,0.019,0.181,0.395,0.164,0.656,0.18,0.175,0.012,0.694,0.12
78,"But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been",1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.008,0.186,0.113,0.01,0.069,0.043,0.026,0.032,0.018,0.12,0.375,0.038,0.725,0.237,0.182,0.007,0.75,0.061
79,It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain,2-Positive,2-NIL,0.001,0.001,0.0,0.001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.993,0.004,0.042,0.461,0.496,0.056,0.001,0.937,0.005
80,"And you can see in the first nine months, we've given back about 0.3 share points",2-Positive,0-Confident,0.006,0.088,0.035,0.006,0.017,0.01,0.018,0.015,0.007,0.269,0.53,0.036,0.34,0.624,0.64,0.003,0.346,0.012
81,So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward,1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.001,0.001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.993,0.003,0.001,0.992,0.006,0.032,0.002,0.95,0.016
82,It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing,1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.001,0.001,0.0,0.001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.992,0.004,0.001,0.988,0.01,0.068,0.001,0.924,0.008
83,"There were all these competitive launches and then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is – because of industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them",1-Neutral,3-Uncertain,0.239,0.016,0.006,0.643,0.025,0.005,0.007,0.005,0.002,0.004,0.047,0.016,0.922,0.063,0.079,0.013,0.053,0.856
84,So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands – that's a market dynamic change,2-Positive,0-Confident,0.113,0.07,0.017,0.065,0.033,0.009,0.025,0.018,0.006,0.051,0.592,0.094,0.117,0.789,0.544,0.011,0.325,0.12
85,"But, overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance",1-Neutral,3-Uncertain,0.036,0.706,0.136,0.008,0.021,0.009,0.006,0.009,0.007,0.007,0.054,0.01,0.933,0.058,0.103,0.012,0.112,0.773

91,"So I think one of the principal contributors at the cost line was, remember in the year-ago comp, we had California ballot spending, Adam",1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.02,0.021,0.849,0.01,0.016,0.012,0.006,0.007,0.005,0.026,0.028,0.011,0.967,0.022,0.09,0.012,0.685,0.212

93,I would say that the competition in the smokeless side of the business is competitive,1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.041,0.077,0.027,0.02,0.032,0.006,0.039,0.027,0.008,0.08,0.642,0.044,0.853,0.103,0.171,0.007,0.766,0.056

101,Has it primarily been related to these new launches or is it behind the core flagship brands and how do you expect some of those competitive dynamics to persist over the next few quarters?,1-Neutral,2-NIL,0.29,0.03,0.011,0.19,0.126,0.014,0.031,0.02,0.007,0.01,0.271,0.038,0.783,0.179,0.22,0.008,0.71,0.062

104,"So we mentioned in our remarks, we've got, I think, five of them over the course of the year, which is higher than we typically see",1-Neutral,3-Uncertain,0.01,0.078,0.036,0.012,0.013,0.007,0.017,0.015,0.005,0.076,0.731,0.021,0.932,0.047,0.07,0.012,0.035,0.882
