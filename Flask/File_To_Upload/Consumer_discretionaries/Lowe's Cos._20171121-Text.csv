"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone"
"Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5% to $16.8 billion, supported by total customer transaction growth of 0.7% and total average ticket growth of 5.8% to $72.63. The acquisitions of MSH and Central contributed 70 basis points of the growth in the quarter, while new stores contributed 50 basis points"
"The calendar shift from the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 had no impact on comp sales, but it did decrease third quarter total sales growth by approximately $60 million or 40 basis points"
"Comp sales were 5.7%, driven by an average ticket increase of 4.8% and transaction growth of 0.9%"
"Looking at monthly trends, comps were 3.9% in August, 8.2% in September and 4.5% in October"
"And as Rick indicated, we drove traffic in-store and online with optimized messaging and our strategic investments in integrated omni-channel experiences, capitalizing on customers' continued desire to invest in their homes"
"Our teams also responded to the demand generated by hurricanes Harvey and Irma this quarter, and we estimate that the storms positively impacted comp sales by approximately 140 basis points"
"Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.07% of sales, a decrease of 28 basis points from the third quarter of last year"
"And as we've grown our market share in appliances, gross margins have been impacted from both a mix and rate perspective"
"Additionally, there was a mix impact from hurricane-related demand"
"And lastly, we continue to take competitive actions, which were partially offset by benefits from value improvement as well as early results from pricing optimization efforts"
"SG&A for the quarter was 22.71% of sales, which leveraged 323 basis points"
"In last year's third quarter, we reported $462 million in non-cash charges, which drove 293 basis points of the leverage for this year"
Please refer to Page 14 in our supplemental slides for a summary of those charges
"The main driver of the remaining 30 basis points of leverage was 27 basis points of payroll leverage, primarily the result of our new store leadership model"
"Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $358 million, which leveraged 31 basis points"
Operating income increased 326 basis points to 9.23% of sales
The prior year non-cash charges accounted for 293 basis points of the increase in operating income
"Interest expense for the quarter was $160 million, which leveraged 8 basis points"
"The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.1% compared to 51.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The higher rate last year was driven by the joint venture non-cash charge, which was a long-term capital loss"
"And earnings per share was $1.05 for the third quarter, a 19.3% increase over last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.88. This is in line with our expectation"
Now turning to the balance sheet
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $743 million
Inventory at $12.4 billion increased $1.4 billion or 12.8% versus the third quarter last year
This is primarily driven by investments in key categories such as appliances and tools as well as investments across Pro categories
Part of the increase is also attributable to the addition and the acquisitions of MSH and Central
"Inventory turnover was 3.94, an increase of five basis points over the third quarter of last year"
Asset turnover increased 12 basis points to 1.91. Accounts payable of $8.9 billion represented $1.1 billion or 13.6% increase over the third quarter of last year due to the timing of purchases and terms improvement
"At the end of the third quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.16x, and return on invested capital was 19.5%"
Now looking at the statement of cash flows
"We generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively"
"Our capital allocation strategy first focuses on investments that align with our strategic priorities to expand our home improvement reach, develop capabilities to anticipate and support customer needs and generate profitable growth and substantial returns"
"For example, our acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters is a strategic investment to further grow our Pro business by expanding our ability to serve the multi-family housing industry"
The transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings this year
"And after strategic investments, we look to return excess cash to shareholders"
"In the quarter, we paid $344 million in dividends"
"In August, we entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for approximately 3.2 million shares"
We also repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares for $250 million through the open-market
"In total, we repurchased $500 million of stock in the quarter"
We have approximately $2.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization
"Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed on Lowe's' business outlook"
We are reaffirming our guidance for the year
"While we expect incremental hurricane-related sales in the fourth quarter, we continue to optimize our investments in customer-facing associate hours to fully capitalize on the strong traffic trends generated by our enhanced marketing efforts"
"We are also facing a tough prior year comparison, and as you know, weather in the fourth quarter is unpredictable"
"Also, earnings per share of $1.05 in the third quarter was again in line with our expectations"
"With that backdrop, for the year, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 5%, driven by a number of factors"
"First, we are forecasting comp sales increase of approximately 3.5%"
"Second, the RONA acquisition is expected to drive about 2% growth due to a full year of RONA results versus roughly seven months from 2016. Also, we expect new stores and acquisitions of MSH and Central to add approximately 1%"
"Also, keep in mind, total sales growth will be reduced by roughly 1.5% related to the comparison of 52 weeks in 2017 to 53 weeks in 2016. On a GAAP basis, we are anticipating an operating margin increase of 80 to 100 basis points"
"Remember, full year of RONA results versus roughly seven months last year will pressure operating margin by an estimated 15 to 20 basis points for 2017. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% for 2017. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.30. Again, please refer to Page 14 in our supplemental slides for a summary of adjustments as you compare 2017 to 2016. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion"
"This results in estimated free cash flow of approximately $4.2 billion for 2017. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2017. Christie, we're now ready for questions"
Question-and-Answer Session
I'll take the first part
We were actually pleased with what we're seeing from in-store and online traffic in August
"And as Rick mentioned, we were working on investing in increasing our associate hours for customer-facing in areas where we need it the most to ultimately help us drive better conversion"
"So as that played out in the quarter, we began to see that pickup in September, but a little bit soft in August"
We think that our guidance for the quarter for the year is appropriate and balanced as we look to invest in running the business and continue to invest in our ongoing capabilities
"We are confident in our ability to drive traffic in Q4. We do expect some benefit from the hurricanes as we move into Q4 and into 2018. But one of the things again, we've been optimizing our selling hours in the stores"
[Indiscernible]
We like where we are today
"But again, recognize Q4, we have tough comparisons to last year"
"So, as we mentioned, weather can be kind of wildcard in the fourth quarter"
"So just keep those in mind as we head into Q4. As far as where we are quarter-to-date, we're just slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter"
"So ultimately, the gross impact obviously hurt our mix because it is below average company rate on gross margin"
So that certain had an impact
"We did have incremental SG&A expenses, but all told, net-net, while it was slightly positive, it wasn't a driver to our earnings for the quarter"
"Eric, this is Marshall"
"Actually, yes and yes, we want both, sales productivity and SG&A productivity cost out"
"So those will continue to be focus area so you think about some of the investments we're making from the omni-channel capabilities, we want those to be sales drivers and think about processes within the stores from this customer experience to services, again, trying to eliminate employee customer pain points"
But we've got good line of sight into actions one that we took this year
"Rick highlighted a couple of those with indirect spend, moving the needle on how much we centralized indirect spend, along with some of the changes we've made to the payroll staff model, the leadership changes that we made earlier in the year, along with things that we're doing from supply chain efforts to drive better productivity, reduce burden for the distribution center and stores"
"So, all of that wrapped up into amount of investments we've made in 2017 to be able to drive flat operating margin on an adjusted basis for 2017 and knowing that we've got future opportunity to keep getting after from a productivity standpoint and moving to 2018 and 2019 and beyond"
