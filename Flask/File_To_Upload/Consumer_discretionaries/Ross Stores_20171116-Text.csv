Good afternoon
"Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations"
"We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year"
"Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have"
"As noted in today's press release, our third quarter sales and earnings outperformed our expectations despite being up against our toughest prior year comparison and two major hurricanes during the quarter"
"We are pleased with these results, which reflect our continued market share gains in a challenging retail environment"
"Earnings per share for the period were $0.72, up 16% from last year"
These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that's expected to reverse in the fourth quarter
Net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year
"Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year"
Operating margin of 13.3% was better than expected mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on above-plan sales
"For the first nine months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $2.36, up 15% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year"
"Net earnings were $912 million, up from $817 million last year"
"Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.1 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 4% gain in the same period last year"
"By region, trends were fairly broad-based, with the Midwest performing the strongest during the period"
We estimate that the hurricanes in Texas and Florida had a minimal impact to the quarter as sales rebounded significantly following the storms
"By merchandise category, children's was the best-performing area, benefiting from solid execution of our merchandising strategies"
"Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS continue to post better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profit for the third quarter"
"As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4%, with average in-store inventories flat compared to the prior year"
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% last year
"Turning to our expansion programs, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in third quarter, completing our 2017 store opening program"
"We expect to end the year with 1,408 Ross and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores, a net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017. Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year"
"Thank you, Michael"
"Again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected results we achieved in the third quarter despite facing our toughest prior year comparisons and two major hurricanes"
"As we enter the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by our above-plan sales and earnings trends year-to-date"
"In addition, our merchants have done an excellent job of acquiring exciting assortment of sharply priced name-brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today's holiday shoppers"
"While we're optimistic about our prospects for the fourth quarter, our guidance reflects an uncertain external environment and the likelihood of yet another very promotional holiday season"
"As Michael just mentioned, we also faced our own challenging multi-year comparisons"
"Nonetheless, we believe that off-price will remain a strong performing segment in retail, driven by consumers ongoing focus on value"
"Most importantly, we have a consistent track record of being able to deliver the compelling bargains that our customers' desire"
All of this makes us confident in our ability to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings over the long term
"At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have"
Question-and-Answer Session
"In terms of a product this year versus last year, what I would say is that our business is performing – our performance is pretty broad-based right now"
So we feel good as we enter into the fourth quarter that both our apparel and non-apparel businesses are working well
"In terms of difference on the floor, what I would say is you'll see an expansion of gifts"
"And I think in terms of values on the floor, there's been a lot of availability in the market, and we've had solid execution by the merchants all year"
And that translates to good values in fashions on the floor for the fourth quarter
Sure
"I would say that there aren't any really strong, strong fashion trends out there"
"I mean, there's some smaller trends, but something that would be – would change the course of what you were doing going from a skinny jeans, to a wide-legged pants"
There's no major fashion trend
"So I think that's part of the issue as you go through, particularly in ladies' apparel, that there are any real drivers out there"
"The trends that are out there, however, we have in our assortment and because we've been able to execute at such a high level and have liquidity, we've been able to take availability and get in season goods"
"And so we feel pretty good about our assortments as we enter into the fourth quarter, but I actually think a big part of the fashion quotient in the ladies' business is the lack of fashion to be honest"
Thanks
"In terms of performance, the ladies' business performed slightly behind the chain average, and home performed slightly ahead of the chain average"
"And in ladies', as you would expect, that's a difficult business in the outside world, so we were pleased with that performance and continue to work on that business"
In terms of Q4 merchandise margin
Sure
"And in terms of non-apparel and the product mix as it relates to the store, first, we decide what businesses we want to drive and what trends we want to drive"
"In terms of utilizing square footage, since we've cut our inventory 40% over the last six years or so, that space is an issue in terms of maximizing that space"
We drive that base off of really what products we want to drive and put in front of the customer
We don't necessarily just say we want to build the space we say what is that she really wants and can we deliver compelling bargains and then that's how we decide how we're going to expand the business
"And in terms of businesses, you're asking me what businesses we like to expand go forward? I mean we really wouldn't"
discuss it on the call so
"We're always trying to diversify the mix in the store but giving specifics on the call, we wouldn't talk to"
"And in terms of the Kid's business, the performance was broad-based so it was every segment, infants, boys, girls"
And we've had really solid execution in there
And so we were able to chase a lot of that business and offer compelling bargains to the customer
"So the way we think about packaway is, there's no definitive number we go out there thinking about it with"
We really do it based off of what the merchandise that's offered out there is for us
"So if it's a great deal, we buy it"
And so that oftentimes builds to the number that you get to
You're trying to get to – if we're chasing business by pack it away because sometimes there are compelling bargains of seasonal goods
So if it's sweaters or outerwear or things like that you want to pack that away because you can use those to open the season and to drive sales until you get more availability in the marketplace
"So we feel good about packaway, and we feel very good about the contents of the packaway that we have right now"
"Well, it's been promotional all year"
What I really think is that it will be more promotional
It's already started to be promotional
"We are starting earlier, and then that last-minute push up at the very end, our expectation is that it will be more promotional than it was last year as part of that is to believe, but I do believe that"
"And so we're trying to posture ourselves understanding that, that's what that looks like"
Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores
