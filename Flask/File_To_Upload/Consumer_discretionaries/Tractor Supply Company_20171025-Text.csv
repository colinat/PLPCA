"Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone"
"For the quarter ended September 30, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales increased 11.6% to $1.72 billion, resulting in net income of $91.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share"
Comparable store sales increased 6.6% versus a reported decrease of 0.6% last year
"As a reminder, our Q3 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's third quarter comparable store sales decrease would have been 1.1%"
"As Greg mentioned, comps were positive across all geographic regions and major product categories, and benefited from an extended summer selling season"
Sales also benefited later in the quarter from the sale of emergency response products related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma
And we estimate this benefited same-store sales by approximately 120 basis points
"As a result, sales were strong in all three months of the quarter, with July being the highest comp increase"
Comparable store transaction count increased 5%
This compares to prior-year's reported 0.5% increase
"Comparable store transaction count increased across all regions of the country, and was driven principally by strength in our C"
"items, along with strength in seasonal categories and emergency response-related products, as well"
Average comp ticket increased 1.5% compared to prior-year's reported 1.1% decrease
"This quarter's increase was driven principally by the mix of goods, as well as the strength of big-ticket sales, partially offset by deflation"
"Big ticket overall comp was above chain average, principally driven by strong sales of generators, as well as strength in utility vehicles and fuel-handling items"
We estimate deflation impacted average ticket by approximately 30 basis points
"As a reminder, Petsense store sales are not yet reflected in our reported comparable store sales results, as those stores will be included in the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which increased 20 basis points to 34.9%"
We were pleased with how the team managed margin during the quarter
"Direct product margin was positive to prior year, with rate being the primary driver"
The rate improvement was driven principally through strong inventory management and strategic sourcing initiatives
"Additionally, we were less promotional during the quarter, as the extended summer selling season resulted in strong seasonal sell through"
"The mix of merchandise did not have a significant impact on direct product margin, as the strong comp sales performance was broad based across all product categories"
"The unfavorable impact of strong generator sales was offset by the favorable impact of strong sales of truck accessories, tools and hardware, which are above-margin categories"
"Freight, however, negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories, higher average fuel costs, and, to a lesser extent, growth in our online business"
"Petsense provided a slight benefit to gross margin, as these stores operate at a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores"
"For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 80 basis points to 26.3% of sales compared to 25.5% of sales in the prior-year's quarter"
The deleverage was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and additional investments in key strategic areas
Incentive compensation expense represented approximately 40 basis points of the deleverage in the quarter
The strong performance in this year's third quarter versus last year's third quarter drove the higher incentive compensation expense
"By comparison, incentive expense declined approximately 60 basis points as a percentage of sales in last year's third quarter from softer sales and earnings"
"The remaining increase in the SG&A rate was driven primarily by investments in payroll and other strategic initiatives to drive customer service and long-term growth, as well as the addition of the Petsense SG&A, which tends to operate at a higher expense ratio than Tractor Supply"
Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 36.4% compared to 36.5% last year
Turning to the balance sheet
"At the end of the third quarter, we had a cash balance of $70 million and $510 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $56 million and $295 million in outstanding debt last year"
"During the third quarter, we acquired 1.4 million shares for $78.5 million through our stock repurchase program"
"Year-to-date, we have acquired a total of 5.2 million shares for $326.6 million"
The reported consolidated average inventory per-store decline of 9.2% includes the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average
"Exclusive of Petsense, average inventory levels per store decreased 1.9% against last year's third quarter"
We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter as well as the management of our working capital
"Now, with respect to our outlook, based on the trends and results in the third quarter, we're updating our outlook for the full-year fiscal 2017. We expect full-year sales to range from $7.17 billion to $7.22 billion, comparable store sales increase between 1.7% and 2.2%, and net income to range from $416 million to $421 million, and earnings per diluted share to be $3.25 to $3.29. Assumed in this guidance is an operating margin decline of 70 basis points to 90 basis points, a tax rate of 36.5%, average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 128 million to 128.4 million and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million"
"We expect to hit our new store targets of 100 Tractor Supply stores and 25 Petsense stores, and continue to be pleased with new store productivity"
"With respect to the fourth quarter, we experienced warmer than normal weather conditions during the first two weeks of the quarter"
"However, where the weather has turned cooler, we have begun to see increased demand for cold weather seasonal products"
We believe we are well-positioned heading into the fall and winter season with a solid plan to drive winter seasonal merchandise when the colder weather arrives
"As a reminder, adjusting for the week shift, the fourth quarter is cycling prior-year positive 3.8% comparable store sales results"
"We expect deflation in the fourth quarter, and the full year to be approximately 30 basis points"
"With respect to gross margin, we will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share"
"We expect headwinds from both product mix and transportation costs in the fourth quarter, and therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter in comparison to prior year"
"With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we will continue to drive operating efficiencies to offset incremental investments in key strategic initiatives"
"For the fourth quarter, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points"
"Factors to consider are: first, we expect to continue to invest payroll in our stores, distribution centers, and customer solution center to drive strong customer-service levels"
"This investment reflects incremental hours and, to a lesser extent, higher average wage rates compared to prior year"
We're also cycling favorable medical and worker's compensation-related costs in the prior year
"Depreciation expense is expected to grow 11% to 12% over the prior year, resulting from our key strategic investments in technology and supply chain enhancements"
"Additionally, we are cycling the prior year 53rd week, which benefited last year's fourth quarter expense leverage"
"We will of course provide our initial outlook for 2018 on our year-end conference call, but in keeping with our past practices, let me provide you with some considerations for your modeling into next year"
We expect to finish the construction of our New York distribution center in Q3 2018 and begin servicing stores in late fourth quarter
"We are forecasting that related pre-opening expenses and incremental operating expenses for this distribution center to increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis, impacting earnings per share by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, with most of the impact in the second half of the year"
"Also, should we achieve our targeted results in 2018, higher incentive compensation could raise SG&A and impact earnings by $0.06 to $0.08. We expect some moderate impact from higher-wage inflation at both the stores and distribution centers due to pressures from both state regulations, as well as competition"
"Additionally, we anticipate continued headwind from freight expense due to growth in C"
"and other more freight-intensive products, higher average transportation costs and growth in our online business"
"Over the past two years, we have invested in several key initiatives to position the company for long-term growth"
We have managed the business and related investment spending to absorb these costs in our financial model while delivering solid bottom-line growth
"Therefore, as we continue to invest in long term growth of the company, our goal is to execute these incremental investments while managing the financial impact to enable us to deliver earnings growth"
That concludes our prepared remarks
"Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions"
Question-and-Answer Session
"Yeah, David, this is Kurt, and good question"
On the transportation side what we're seeing are a number of factors
The growth in C
"continues to have pressure on the transportation freight expense as those items, bulkier, heavier commodity items have a higher freight rate to them"
"Additionally, we certainly were able to capitalize on opportunities to sell certain items that are bulkier and big product that have a larger freight charge to them"
That was part of the third quarter
That is a little bit more specific to third and perhaps fourth quarter
"I will tell you that what we're seeing in addition to that is on the oil pricing and the cost of fuel, we saw an increase in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter we expect to have higher average fuel costs"
"And then lastly, both domestically and internationally we are seeing increases in transportation costs, and those items we expect to carry into next year"
"And I mentioned this briefly on the last call, too"
"When we look ahead to 2018, first I'd say with fourth quarter still ahead of us, and right now we're heavily into building the budget and the forecast for 2018, I can't necessarily get into too much detail"
"But I'd tell you that when we look at 2018 on the gross margin side, we do see the expectation that freight headwinds to continue into 2018. As we said before, 2018 will continue to be a year we invest in our long-term growth initiatives"
"So for the items that I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, I believe there's SG&A headwinds, as I mentioned"
"And I would say at this point, we would expect to see operating margin for next year have somewhat of a slight decline"
A little bit early to say
"We'll have more information as we end Q4. At this point, looking out, I can probably just tell you that we're somewhat realistic and cautious on operating margin and would expect to see some slight decline"
"Yeah, it's a good question"
"On the fourth quarter, I'd say the couple of assumptions are that we do see strength in the core of the business"
And that's a key part of our assumption
The fourth quarter is a quarter where weather can heavily impact the performance of it
"So, the assumed guidance range assumes somewhat of a normal fourth quarter, and expecting continued strength in our C"
product
Any favorable weather or change in weather that's unfavorable could heavily impact the performance of the top-line sales
"Yeah, this is Kurt, and the best I can tell you is that, as we mentioned, the strongest month of the quarter was July, and that's where we saw the extended summer-selling season"
And I don't have specifics on exactly the impact to the overall top line
I would tell you that it was beneficial to July and it was not a strong significant impact to the overall comps
It was probably somewhere around 100 basis points to something less than that
"Yeah, Chris, this is Kurt"
"I'd tell you, as I was preparing items to mention for 2018, I specifically brought up things that I believe may not be in the models or may not be factored in"
"Items that have changed in 2017 that we believe will carry into 2018, such as transportation costs, such as some of the labor headwinds, and gave you some color on the distribution center"
"So, I would tell you that bringing those up, it's because I anticipate those may not be factored into 2018's guidance"
"Well, Chris, I think the one thing I'd tell you is that we don't give guidance on the quarter"
And so the beat to the Street versus our internal expectations may be different
And I would tell you that the one thing in the quarter that was the primary item not expected was the $0.02 beat related to the hurricane
"Sure, Seth"
"I'd tell you that, as I mentioned, the big ticket sales were boosted by generator sales and other big ticket items from the hurricanes and were above chain average"
"When you exclude the impact of the hurricanes, big ticket had positive comps, but was slightly below the chain average"
"Yeah, Scott, this is Kurt"
It's a good question and we look at both of those capital allocation investment items
New stores certainly are a key to Tractor Supply's overall growth strategy
They provide a good return on the investment
"But today, what you're hearing and where we're focused on is not only growing the stores for continued top-line growth, but we're also focused on the things that we need to do and are part of our strategy for long-term growth"
"And so at this point, the 100 stores as part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue to evaluate that annually"
And we do look at the e-commerce side of it
"When I say e-commerce, I believe Steve and I would agree on this in that we refer to it more as the digital"
Because it's an omni-channel investment
And so many of the sales can begin online
"As Greg mentioned, the number of new or unique visitors to the website, how many are starting through a mobile device"
"So when we speak about e-commerce online investment, it's about the overall growth for Tractor Supply, both online and in the stores"
"So to get to the answer to your question, I would say that we're focused on challenging both store growth and the other digital investments, and we continue to analyze that"
That could lead us to a number of store growth that is below 100 if we believe we need to manage both the capital and the SG&A burden of our investments
And we balance both of those out for the long term
"Yeah, it's a good question"
I would say we've been on an increasing capital growth rate for omni-channel digital investment
We'll be near $65 million to $70 million investment this year
That number will grow next year
It may begin to stabilize on the investment specific to IT and digital at about $70 million or $80 million
"But as a percentage, yeah, that's a bigger percentage"
"And it is a good analysis to say we'll evaluate both store capital investment along with the IT investment, and the IT investment may continue to bring a bigger percentage"
And we have looked at 2017 and 2018 as investment years
"So I would say it is a good way to describe 2018 continuing to have investment for the long term, and we're excited about the momentum we're seeing and some of those initiatives taking hold as part of the top-line sales growth"
"The only thing I'll add to that is our long-term strategy or targets have not changed, and we're not saying that they have changed"
"At the Investment Community Day, we emphasized the long-term growth plan, particularly, as you mentioned, operating margin growth, 15, 20 basis point improvement"
"We said and knew that 2017 would not be in line with those long-term growth strategies, and we said the long-term growth is three to five years"
"And as 2017 has played out, additional pressures and costs on transportation, payroll investments, has perhaps changed a little bit of the level of performance that we foresee for 2018, but we still see realistic long-term targets for Tractor Supply to be able to drive the top line, as well as the operating margin growth rate in the long term"
"Sure, Brad"
This is Kurt
"First, on CapEx, the guidance coming down is really two things"
"Most significant is going to be timing shift of the New York distribution center, and just the timing of key initial costs that go into it are shifting out of 2017 and into 2018. The only other real key change is more of a mix of the type of stores"
"So we either have a low-capital intensive prototype lease store or a retrofit with more capital, and the mix of stores in the back half Q3, Q4, has impacted the expectation on capital spending that has caused us to drop that $20 million"
"New store productivity, we're – as I mentioned on the call, we are pleased with new store productivity"
The trends continue to show improvement over the 2016 year
"And the results that we're seeing in the last couple of quarters, I think you'd see is pretty consistent to years like 2014 and 2015. The selection of stores and our ability to enter the markets quickly we've been pretty excited about"
"One thing on new-store productivity as you're calculating it, just as a reminder, with the integration of Petsense, with the smaller size, different model, the new store productivity, Petsense brings – has about a 600 basis point impact, bringing the number down"
"So if you exclude that out of your calculation, I think you'll be more in line with what we look at as the comparable Tractor Supply new store productivity"
"Yeah, Ben, this is Kurt"
"On the ticket side, I'd say we said about 1.5% comp ticket increase for the third quarter, and roughly about a third of that was related to the big ticket and the hurricanes"
"The rest of it was principally more broad, just overall product mix"
"So from the ticket side, I'd say that's really about 50 basis points, and you can basically deduct that as part of the 120 basis point overall"
"And then on the gross margin side, when it comes to rate, we basically saw that the hurricanes drove top line, did not really have a significant impact on the rate"
"We had generators at a lower average rate price, but you had other higher-ticket items on the truck tool or hardware side"
"And then you did have some higher transportation costs to get the product to the consumer, and get it there quickly"
There certainly were some higher transportation costs
"You probably also read and heard that generally, starting in about late August, September, the demand for transportation through those hurricanes put a significant demand on the transportation system, and costs went up"
So we look at it on the gross margin side as about a net neutral on rate
"Yeah, sure, Peter"
"First, I'd tell you that, as Greg mentioned, with additional hours, where it's meeting the customer's needs, and as our customer comes into the store, and is looking for that expert advice and service, as well as the customer solution center, we've invested additional payroll hours"
We believe that's all part of the top-line growth
"Our stores speak and talk often, as you've heard us talk about G"
And we want to make sure that our G
and our customer service is at the top level currently today in the retail environment
"So, that is having an impact"
We believe it's all part of our initiative and what's driving the top line
"When it comes to the wage pressure, I would just say that what we've seen in pockets, certain states, as you're aware, have instituted some regulations that have had an impact to us"
"And then in pockets both in the stores and distribution center side, where there's some competitive wage pressures, it is important for us to maintain – hire and maintain the best team members, and we've certainly made sure that that is top priority"
"And that is putting some level – moderate level of impact in the third and fourth quarter, and we believe we'll see some of that in 2018. Not saying that this is a level of significant it could have a 10 or 20 basis point impact in 2018 on the wage side"
"Yeah, Rob"
The best I can tell you at this point is we're going through our budgeting timeframe right now
"The items that I mentioned, such as the new distribution center investment and the additional depreciation related to the investments, those are the more significant items"
"And so I would tell you they're listed in order of magnitude being depreciation and a new distribution center, to a lesser extent payroll and wage pressures is probably the best I can tell you at this point"
"Still a lot to be calculated and forecasted for 2018. Incentive comp, as I mentioned, I gave you the magnitude of that"
It all depends on performance in 2018 and could have a magnitude of $0.06 to $0.08 next year
"Afternoon, John"
Okay
"Yeah, Stephen, in regards to Q4, we continue to see benefit and expect and anticipate from our gross margin initiatives pricing, strategic sourcing"
We see some opportunity at the product margin rate in gross margin
"Our anticipation is that would be offset by the headwinds we've seen on the transportation side, so it's really simply when it comes to compare, we think we can drive some improvement in the direct product margin, but that is going to be offset by higher costs on the transportation side"
"And then in regards to the long-term operating margin, I guess the best we could say is that we anticipate next year for the few items we mentioned and the investments in our long-term initiatives to have an increase in SG&A for those items"
But most of those are either one time or they're temporary investments
And what I would tell you is that we see from there we're able to build as we are able to impact the top line and be able to maintain and improve the level of expense leverage from there
"So looking out beyond 2018, it's too difficult to get specific, but there's a lot of what you see in the 2018 investments similar to 2017 that are very specific to the current or temporary investments in the business"
