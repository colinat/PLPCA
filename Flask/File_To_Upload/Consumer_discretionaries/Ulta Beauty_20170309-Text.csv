"Thank you, Laurel"
Good afternoon everyone the Ulta Beauty team delivered very strong fourth quarter results capping an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth
While investing to drive market share gains and create substantial long-term shareholder value
Let me start with the quick review of the headwinds for the fourth quarter
We grew the top-line 24.6% and delivered 16.6% comps on top of 12.5% comps in the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by strong traffic and ticket growth
"Multiple factors strength across our product offerings, our best-in-class loyalty programs, great in store execution, investing in marketing and labor and steadily improving supply chain capabilities all work together to driver seller growth across both our retail and online business"
E-commerce growth exceeded our plan driven by strong traffic and outstanding fulfillment execution during the holiday
"Our services continue to gain share as we grow our business with existing guest and acquire new ones, significantly outpacing industry growth"
"In contrast with above plan sales growth, earnings per share growth of 32.5% also exceeded our expectations"
"Before I guide with the detailed review of the fourth quarter, I would like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the full year"
"In fiscal 2016 we drove top-line growth of 23.7% and earnings growth of 30.9% well above our expectations at the beginning of the year achieving robust market share gains, solid execution and strong flow through on better than expected sales"
We achieved a 15.8% comps with 13.4% comps in-stores and 56.2% growth in e-commerce with healthy traffic and tick growth each quarter during the year
Underlying this financial performance with a many significant accomplishments we achieved as we executed against our six strategic imperatives
We opened 100 net new stores and continue to deliver very healthy new store productivity
"We completed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores and also executed update to the Ulta Beauty collection, fragrance area and nail fixtures"
"We added 69 new brands to our portfolio, reflecting the fact that Ulta Beauty is a great place for our brand partners to grow"
"We grew active membership in our loyalty program by 5.2 million members to 23.4 million active members, an increase of 28%"
We increased our aided brand awareness to 86% as we continue to drive marketing effectiveness and efficiency
We launched our - successfully launched our Ulta Beauty credit card program
"We continue to improve our supply chain capabilities, successfully opening a new DC in Dallas and further ramping the Greenwood DC we opened in 2015. Finally, we also seamlessly implemented several new core merchandising systems, which will improve our capabilities across merchandise planning and forecasting, as well as stage planning allocation, driving higher in stock as we continue to grow"
I am so proud of this team and the traffic year we delivered
I’d now like to go into a little bit more detail on some of the key drivers specific to our fourth quarter performance
Starting with our first strategic imperative which is acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests
"We increased asset membership in our ultimate rewards loyalty program by 1.7 million members during the quarter, driven by compelling marketing communication and excellence conversion in-store"
"We continue to see strength in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average members’ ticket"
"Our loyalty program allows us to execute compelling serum campaigns, which drove incremental sales and margin"
We also more than doubled our share play campaign delighting our guest with free gift who are driving additional sales
"Our ultimate rewards credit card program exceeded expectations, driven by above planned new account sign up and higher average sales for cardholder"
We also experience very strong gift card sales contributing to our sales momentum after the holidays
"This spring we plan to launch Ulta Beauty gift cards in major grocery chains across the country, which will allow us to reach thousands of locations with the new point of presence for the brand"
Our team successfully executed on three key events during the fourth quarter
"Holiday, our hair care jumbo size promotion and our signature love your skin event"
"For the holiday season, we launched new creative for our television and radio ads, centered on our Joy To The Girl campaign, which was integrated across all touch points"
"We increased our TV, digital video and cinema ads and dramatically increased impressions with content partnerships with POPSUGAR, Refinery 29, Café Media and E-news Freestyle"
"We also made a big impact with social media with our Joy It Forward integration, delighting our connoisseurs [ph] and ultimately reward members with custom beauty boxes"
Post-holiday we refined our long standing and very popular hair care event featuring bitter and jumbo size product to drive sales and margin improvements with the fresh approach that sharpen the appeal and impacted of the event
We also adjusted the cadence of the marketing and added radio advertising
"These are other modifications let to be most successful leader event in our history, with strong growth across our largest brands both in-store and online"
"Our business was very strong in January as well anchored by our successful Love Your Skin event, which drove growth in both mass and prestige skin care"
"We focused our communications and merchandising to help our guest truly understand the benefits and features of the brands and products within the skin care arena, which can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate in light of the complexity of the category"
"De-mystifying skincare was a key theme throughout our marketing massaging, as we highlighted regimens for various skincare type it help guest discover our bestselling product"
"On the merchandizing front we continue to see trends similar to the preceding quarters during the year, with prestige cosmetics leading the way, but with strength across all major categories and newness contributing significantly to our performance"
"Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Too Faced, Tarte, Anastasia, Clinique, Lancôme, [indiscernible] Ardell, Real Techniques and the Ulta Beauty collection were notable among the best performing brands for the quarter with all brands providing terrific newness for the holiday season"
"While cosmetics were the biggest comp driver in the quarter, we gained market share across all major categories, skincare both mass and prestige accelerated this quarter with strength in mass continuing interest in Korean beauty trends and the recent addition of three major new brands Proactiv and Shiseido and Origins contributing strong growth as they ramp up in the assortment"
The power of social media influencers are driving particular strength in prestige skincare brands like Mario Badescu and Peter Thomas Roth
"Our own Ulta Beauty collection performed very well in the quarter, benefiting from upgrades to in-store presentation, formulations and packaging all rolled out earlier in the year and from new product positions in popular holiday kit"
Looking ahead we are excited to announce today a new partnership with the Estee Lauder Companies
We'll be launching their MAC brand online in early May and will begin to rollout MAC to stores starting in June and continuing throughout the year
We plan to reach more than 100 stores in 2017 including the majority of new stores opening in the second half of the year
MAC is the number one prestige makeup brand in the U.S
and one of the strongest brands in America
"MAC has along their one of our guest more reflected brands in its addition to our assortment helped us reach and better serve audiences that are important to us including Teams, Millennial and diverse customers"
The highlight is strong positioning as a makeup artistry brand we plan to offer MAC makeup services at all stores in which we rollout the brand
The service components of the MAC offering is yet another example of how we're able to enhance and differentiate the shopping experience and drive traffic to our stores
"Turning to the services business, salon sales increased 15.2% and comps 8.8% with strength in hair color and makeup services"
Color services got a boost from the launch of Redken pH-Bonder a color additive that better protects the integrity of the hair during color services
"In skin, MICROZONE services were a standout as the targeted promotion drove new guest acquisition"
"We continue to evolve our marketing strategy by utilizing our CRM and loyalty programs to simplify offers to attract new guests to the salon, while still driving great value and great experience"
"In addition to continuing their participation in New York Fashion Week, the Ulta Beauty our testing team recently styled the hair of the dancers performing at the Super Ball Half Time show with Lady Gaga, garnering significant exposure on social media and continuing to raise our profile as a hair authority"
Our Benefit Brow boutiques continue their strong performance with brow services now available in about 850 stores
"Benefit Brow bars complemented their services business with product newness, including exciting product launches in the lip and eye shadow categories"
"Now turning to store growth, our growth and development team wrapped up a very busy year opening 25 stores in the fourth quarter to end the year with 974 stores"
New store productivity remains very strong
We've recruited all the real estate sites for our 2017 store program including a handful of stores that are not in our typical suburban locations in which we'll require more capital and higher rents
"These include our new store in Michigan Avenue in Chicago opened this summer, our first store in Manhattan planned for the fall and the store in the Mall of America in Minnesota"
Moving to our e-commerce business
"com sales grew 63.4% on top of 44.2% growth last year, contributing 380 basis points to our total company comps"
This revenue growth was driven almost entirely by increased transactions
"While total traffic growth was up almost 63% mobile traffic rose more than 90%, driven by growth in digital marketing paid channels including search, affiliates, display and Facebook"
"com's product mix continues to mirror that of our stores with strong interest in newness and trials demonstrated by the ongoing success of our online only Beauty Break and Beauty Fads, that give our guests compelling sampling opportunities"
"So this was the first year that our hand supply chain capabilities allowed us to confidently go through the holiday season without travelling demand on this site, enabling sales growth well above planned"
The profitability of our e-commerce business improved as a result of our more efficient fulfillment capabilities as well as the more effective promotional strategy
"Finally, I’d like to update you on our supply chain operations and investments"
Our supply chain team performed very well during the quarter and the team did a great job keeping up with the higher than expected demand both in-stores and online to keep in-stock levels high throughout the quarter and in particular during the holiday selling period
"The Greenwood, Indiana distribution center ramped up to serve 230 stores through the holiday season and delivered 45,000 e-commerce orders per day during the peak"
"Our newer Dallas building ramped to 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day at peak"
"Shipping lead times continue to improve with 88% of orders shipping within 48 hours, it was an 83% improvement compared to 2015 performance"
"We expect to ramp the Greenwood DC to serve both the 300 stores and the Dallas DC to serve a little over 200 stores by the end of 2017. We recently signed a lease for our West Coast distribution center in Fresno California, which we plan to open in the summer of 2018. This sixth DC will be a copy of the Dallas facility and is designed to substantially improve delivery times to the West Coast"
"From a systems perspective, our new forecasting replenishment system SWIFT performed as plan during the holiday period, as a result we saw higher in-stock and increased productivity of our inventory in the fourth quarter"
We also successfully implemented our new floor planning and assortment optimization tool allowing for a more analytical rigor around our assortment decision
"And finally we continue to invest in foundational capabilities like our product information management system, newly deployed to all of our suppliers"
This capability streamlines the catcher of our active product information directly from our brand partners
We are making good progress and we will continue to leverage these investments to improve operational performance and the guest experience
This wraps up my review of the quarter
In sum our excellent fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to our best year yet
Our performance puts us in a unique position in the beauty industry and within the broader retail landscape to take advantage of the many opportunities before us to invest to drive the business for the long-term
"And now I’ll turn it over to Scott, to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter result and our outlook for the first quarter and all of 2017."
"Thank you, Omar"
We tried to be prudent I guess and really reasonable with the guidance that we give on every dimension
We see obviously the core that we’re in; we’ve guided the 9%-11% for the quarter
We feel confident about the strength and what’s happening in the business our ability to understand the dynamics and the levers that we have to continue to drive the results in a healthy long-term way
So I would just say that really there is no change to the long-term guidance we always said that it would be stronger in the beginning and sort of moderate a bit out in the out years
So the 7% to 9% is the longer term and as we guided 8% to 10% for this year we feel just it’s very much in our line of side and feel very confident about being able to deliver that
Thank you
Yeah I will talk about these in sort of just overall terms
"First of all let me reiterate we’re thrilled about the launch of MAC, we’re thrilled about the progress we’re making across the box in terms of brands and newness and innovation"
There’s a hundreds of boutiques that with brand expansions that will happen this year
We talked about that in the script I'm not going to break that out in specific deal or the productivity
"What I would say again we’ve referenced it so that upfront there are some investments in terms of getting a brand up and going and these fixtures are a little bit more expensive, but they drive incremental sales and profit"
And also in the long-term excellent for a brand in terms of really reinforcing Ulta Beauty as a great destination for all things beauty
So we feel very good about that current status
We would be very enthusiastic to teach more about the enthusiasm
"But honestly I’ll ask Dave Kimbell to add, I just want to stay that’s actually one of the core reasons and one of the core foundations that why we feel very confident about our long-term prospects is our understanding of the segment, the size of the segment and the momentum"
So I let Dave take it from here
"Thank you Dana, the three point question"
"We show you enthusiasm about the launch MAC and we’re not going to specific about, we’re just getting started right so starting online and we’re going to launch it to a little over 100 stores this year"
And it’s really important brand products to have and we’re confident it’s going add to the mix very nicely and our guess will be very excited about it
Your second question was…
"Online, you mean the margin, right"
"So, I will do this we’re very focused on improving the profitability of online business as we’ve talked about today"
The big part of our supply chain investment is around fulfilling the online orders in a way that better for our gust in terms of speed and also more efficient in terms of cost
"But we expect this to improve, but we expect that the four walls margins are always going to be higher than the online margin"
"On the flip side, so the margins getting stronger, but the great thing is it’s a very incremental business to us, right"
"So, we study this closely, we look at very closely at consumer at our guest trends and the guest who’re shopping online only this is a small number of people it’s really about guest who are shopping in-store and online and that guests who is involved across both channels is really driving 2.5 times more sales really, it’s not somebody who is just buying in-store"
"So, even if that margin is I think in some ways inherently going to be somewhat lower than bricks and mortar, it’s a very incremental business to us"
Feeds very much into the dynamic that Dave was describing about how the beauty enthusiasts shop
"Yes, we certainly are doing the best we can thinking about the cost of rollout of brands and I’d say that’s inherently assumed"
We feel confident about the ability; we’re maintaining the goal of reaching that 15 margin target by the end of 2019. And - but being really I think very smart and prudent about how we get there balancing short and long-term and since Scott talked about it well there now we adapt to new investment long-term in this business and we are definitely going to do that
"Because we know we’ve got - we need to have the right brands, the right in-store experience and the capabilities to support that"
"So, whether or not that top-line could be stronger with some of these brand launches, I don’t know we try to be really as prudent as we can with our guidance"
But we’d like to see how it goes before we call it higher that we think we need to
"Yes, so let me take some of that, maybe I'll start, Dave you want to add"
"I will say this is a bit of a secret sauce, so I'm not going to get very specific about lot of it, because we're really proud about how the royalty program is working"
And as you know the loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales
So obviously that’s part and parcel of the comp growth I mean that’s kind of the way to think of it
"Comp is driven by a lot of components, but the sales are coming from our loyalty members"
"We've done a few things, one is obviously we just converted a couple of years ago to one loyalty program we’ve simplified it we make it - I think our communication about how the program works, how we communicate with that guest, and how we convert new member, potential members in-store are all kind of components of what we've done that’s making work well"
"And I'll let Dave to add more color, but I would just add also what's exciting to me is I am not going to drive that rate of growth of new members forever right, because we’re kind of early the program"
"But we still really only have 20% of the beauty enthusiasts as we define them, shopping it also in the U.S"
There is plenty of more loyalty perspective members out there
"And also even the postcard earner program, we certainly don't have 100% of their share of beauty spend and they're not even buying every category that we offer today"
So we see these as all levers to continue to pull at the top-line - at the top level to help drive to continue to support the kind of comp growth that we are guiding
And maybe Dave just add a couple of more points about what was done with the program
Yeah let me start with that one
So to Manhattan specifically and I guess the other urban sites that we're going forward with this year by and large we expect the same kind of financial results
"I would say Manhattan is a special case, I mean so back to Dave's earlier point about we're putting our standard prototype store in there right it’s 10,000 square feet and that’s an expensive proposition on anywhere on the Island"
We went to a place where we felt most comfortable kind of a neighborhood feel there with a lot of traffic; I know we got to do subway station right here in our front door
"So we're trying to make smart decision as far as the location is concerned that would be a case where we would take something less than our internal hurdle rate, which is way north of 20% right in most of our stores that we open perform way in excess of our internal hurdle rate"
And in case of Manhattan we're still expecting to recoup investment returns well above our cost to capital that’s there that would be another measure that would be significantly lower than 20%
So we feel very comfortable that this is a wise decision and it's going to produce great returns for us
Yeah and there is no purchasing of MAC real estate or anything like that
You asked that question at the end just to clear now this just investment in our store
"No I mean we again, we are giving guide - there is a range of outcomes right, that’s you are looking at a continuum"
And so we feel comfortable that between having flexibility on the upside to do better with promotion tactics I mentioned earlier other benefits coming out of supply chain investment maybe quicker than we had originally sought
And just other stronger retail trends that drive a lot of leverage on fixed store cost so a combination of those things
And as we look at the range we feel very comfortable that we can stick to our target
The promotional environment was that we’re too early taking
I guess the best way to think about it is that we compete across a lot of dimensions
"So I mean we compete with I like to say 70,000 places in any given day that you can buy beauty, because we offer all the product categories and price points"
"So department stores are certainly one source, but we also compete with mass with drug, online retailers"
So it’s really kind of across the board
"Promotional environment I guess for us, what I feel good about it, that we the quarter that we had with consistent levels of promotion a year ago I think is a really good way think about the underlying health of our business and that we have - we’re always going to make sure that we are providing a great value to our guest"
"And so there is always going to be some levels of coupons or promotions in-store, but certainly our loyalty programs allow us to get that much more focused and targeted and we have been doing that over the last few years"
"So I feel like we have got good control of our levers, so we got levers that we use as we need them and more importantly we’re really just in an environment where beauty is certainly the growing category it’s very active there is a lot of players nobody is doing exactly what we do"
So we really try to just play our offence and that’s why we are talking about really continuing to investment in the long-term of our business because obviously beauty enthusiast is holding with their dollars
"We are not complacent, we are not perfect, so we know we just have to stand top of our game"
And then the Ulta Beauty collection
"I think we break it out, it’s between 3%, 4% of the business similar online in-store, which is true for most of our, but actually I am really proud about our little Ulta Beauty collection growth rate"
"I mean Dave talked about this the mass side of our business is very important to our guest and our private label brand we’ve really, really double down in making that a stronger brand that we had"
So part of the investments in-store had to do with making sure that we’re using fixtures and showcasing that brand and to best possible light
"We have invested in - we have redone the packaging, we are really bringing newness to that that line much more rapidly and it’s doing very, very well"
"So I don’t if there is a cap certainly I like it, it’s a great margin and our guest will response our guest is wonderful the constrained would be we are not going to be too big in anything"
I mean we want this to be a mosaic brands that our guest want and love
Having said that we know it’s going to be bigger will be bigger and we have a fair amount of space dedicate and we can make that space even more productive overtime and we will
So we’re proud about what’s happening with Ulta Beauty collection
Thank you
Thank you
"I just want to reiterate we're really proud about the year that we had in 2016. And I really like to thank our 32,000 associates for delivering that year and all their efforts to continue to drive our success in 2017 and beyond"
I appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with everybody soon
