"Good afternoon, everyone"
Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the strength and distinct advantages of the Ulta Beauty business model
"We delivered a double-digit comp in spite of a moderation in the growth rate of our largest category, makeup, and meaningful disruption from hurricanes"
"We flexed our merchandising and marketing plans, leveraged our consumer insights and CRM platform, and worked with our brand partners to create compelling offers for our guests"
We also benefitted from the unmatched breadth of beauty categories and products that we offer
"These levers allowed us to drive significant share gains, continue to rapidly grow our base of loyalty members, and thrive in spite of shifting category trends within the beauty industry and disruption in some of our largest markets"
"Before I share our results, including the financial impact of the hurricanes, I would like to take a moment to mention the fantastic job our teams did to prepare for the storms, support our field associates who were personally impacted and get our stores back up and running following an incredibly challenging time for these regions"
It was truly inspiring to see the collaboration and caring from all corners of our organization to manage through this period
"To recap our third quarter financial performance, we grew the top line 18.6% and delivered healthy 10.3% comps on top of 16.7% comps in the third quarter of 2016, an acceleration on a two-year stack compared to the second quarter"
The disruption from the hurricanes of Florida and Texas negatively impacted our results by a little more than a point of comp
Comp sales were driven by balanced traffic and ticket growth and continued strength in e-commerce
"In terms of category trends, our highest sales growth was in skincare and fragrance, while hair care also strengthened"
"Makeup, while still producing very healthy growth by any standard was softer compared to last year when it drove a disproportionate amount of our comp growth"
GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 grew 21.4%
We delivered better than expected EPS growth despite gross margins contracting a bit more than initially planned
"Some of this margin pressure was expected, driven by new store and boutique activity in the quarter and marketing and test and learn activities pushed back from the first quarter into the back-half"
"In light of the hurricane disruption and the moderation in color cosmetics growth, we decided to boost our CRM and promotional activity"
This allowed us to continue to drive strong market share gains and rapid membership growth in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program
I’ll turn now to a more detailed discussion of the strategies that drove our results in the third quarter
Beginning with our strategic imperative to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests
Our loyalty program continues to deliver significant benefits and well over 90% of our sales are captured through the program
"At the end of October, our Ultamate Rewards program grew to $26.4 million active members, up 21% year-over-year"
"Retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket are healthy and stable"
"To update you on our efforts to increase adoption of our credit card launch, which we launched last year, we’ve rolled out in-store initiatives to drive awareness and are offering new incentives like free gift with sign up in addition to savings on guest’s first purchase with the card"
"We also launched the capability to apply online and buy, which drove significantly higher online applications"
Credit card sign ups continue to grow with new accounts and conversion above plan and we’re continuing to garner a much higher share of wallet of our customers who signed up for the credit card
We’re also very pleased with the growth in third-party distribution of gift cards through our Blackhawk relationship
"We rolled out our gift cards to 10 additional retail partners in the third quarter, bringing our reach to 13,000 stores"
We plan to add another 500 stores with three additional grocery chains in the fourth quarter with more retail partners in the pipeline
"Aided by this expansion, gift card sales grew nearly 50% in the third quarter with expectations for a strong fourth quarter performance"
Now turning to our marketing programs
We executed another successful 21 Days of Beauty Event September
"Historically, this has been a promotion focused on color cosmetics with a strategic intent of migrating customers from our primarily mass basket to a richer basket, blending mass and prestige items"
"This year, we incorporated skincare items to take advantage of the current strong trend in skincare"
"We improved our overall offering, featuring highly sought-after brands and products like MAC lipsticks and increased influencer content across Ulta Beauty channels, digital partner platforms and influencers’ own channels, which all drove excitement to the event"
"In October, we have strong results with our signature Gorgeous Hair event and focused on our partnership with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation"
"We built on the success of our Gorgeous Way To Give campaign performing 42,000 services during our salon Cut for a Cause event, partnered once again with The Ellen DeGeneres Show, garnered more than 5 million views of our new social media campaign featuring breast cancer survivors with an empowering and inspiring message and executed a series of activities all month long in stores, distribution centers and in corporate"
We raised $4 million this year alone to fund research projects to support BCRF’s quest for a cure
We continue to partner with Refinery 29 in the iHeart Music Festival! to drive brand awareness and we launched a new partnership with the Allure Magazine to enhance our position as a beauty destination
This partnership included an Allure Magazine curated mini book called Shop Like a Beauty Editor
This book features the favorite picks of Allure Beauty Editors available at Ulta Beauty
The program also highlighted digital content from Allure editors and their e-mails and the mix section on ulta
com
"We also became the exclusive and presenting sponsor of Demi Lovato Simply Complicated, which is a full-length documentary on YouTube that gives an intimate look into the life of the popular star"
The video has already been viewed more than 10 million time
The partnership includes three get-the-look videos featuring product sold to Ulta Beauty
"These efforts are part of our multi-year strategy to increase awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, which is led to all-time high results to this metric"
"Aided brand awareness now stands at 87%, up from 84% last year, while unaided brand awareness grew to 50%, compared to 41% last year"
"Next, I’d like to provide an update on our merchandising initiatives"
The Ulta Beauty team did a fantastic job of maximizing our brand partnerships ensuring that must-have and often-exclusive product is on our shelves
We continue to drive rapid market share gains across the Board with particular strength in prestige beauty
"According to third quarter data tracked by the NPD Group, Ulta Beauty continue to rapidly grow our share of prestige makeup, accelerated our gains in prestige skincare and fragrance and added 320 basis points of market share in prestige beauty overall"
"Year-to-date, Ulta Beauty grew the Prestige segment by 28%, while all of the retail tracked by NPD only grew in the low single digits netting to a total prestige beauty industry growth rate of 5%"
Our broad and balanced portfolio of product categories and brands continues to be a lever in our ability to deliver healthy comps
"Skincare in both mass and prestige, fragrance, professional hair care, sun care, accessories and personal care appliances all delivered well above the average growth"
"Similar to what we discussed last quarter, the industry overall seems to be experiencing a bit of a lull in innovation in color cosmetics although not across all brands"
"Our prestige boutiques featuring Clinique, Lancome, MAC and benefit brands were very strong as we continue to roll out 700 boutiques this year"
These four high-growth brands contributed almost a third of our total comp growth during the quarter
We’re delighted with our new partnership with MAC
"At the end of the quarter, we had 107 stores rolled out and we’ll have approximately 120 boutiques by year end"
We also rolled out five of MAC Hero skews in our impulse pictures across the chain
Our assortment features several exclusive instant artistry kits available only at Ulta Beauty
MAC has quickly become the number one brand in 80% of the stores where it’s launched is a close second in the rest
Our consumer insight team has surveyed our MAC guests with their findings demonstrating that we’re helping to recruit a new consumer to the brand with roughly 50% of the MAC buyers of Ulta either new to MAC or lapsed MAC users who haven’t purchased the brand in over a year
"Beyond the prestige boutiques, we’ve seen the rest of our prestige color cosmetics category slowing compared to last year’s exceptional pace of growth, but prestige makeup is still very healthy and comping in the high single-digit"
Many of our brands like Tarte and Too Faced are delivering strong innovation and double-digit comps
"Encouragingly, color cosmetics both mass and prestige were very strong during last Friday weekend, which we believe bodes well for this category during the holiday season"
We’re also excited about the developments on the mass side of the assortment in makeup with e
"f rolling out chain-wide next year and cult favorite Morphe, a social media influencer brand focused on eyeshadow palettes and brushes added to 300 doors in an ulta"
com
"Another brand born in social media is Dose of Colors, which was available online-only for the past several months"
Following its success in ulta
"com, we’ve recently introduced two popular pallets to 400 stores"
And we’ll be adding 21 lip and eyeshadow Dose of colors SKUs in time for holiday
"The fragrance was another highlight during the quarter comping in the high teens with success in the base business and several strong new launches, including Chanel Gabrielle, Gucci Bloom and Carolina Herrera, Good Girl"
We continue to launch exclusive fragrances like Ballet Rose From Philosophy and an exclusive line of four fragrances from Kate Spade
"Both prestige and mass skincare comps well above the house with newness from No7, Yes To, Skinfood and MEMEBOX driving strength in mass skincare; and Mario Bedescu, Dermalogica, Peter Thomas Roth and Juice Beauty driving exceptional growth on the prestige side of skincare"
"Our professional hair care category was bolstered by the rollout of Bumble and Bumble in more than 500 stores, new brands like Aquage, the chain-wide rollout of Drybar and newness driving double – strong double-digit comps in DevaCurl, Kenra, Matrix and Pureology"
"So as you can see, there’s a lot going on in our assortment, as we have access to more and more brands that continue to elevate our product offering"
"Now looking ahead to next year, we’re excited about the new brand pipeline with additions in every major category, including makeup, skincare and hair care, as well as a significant refill in our mass cosmetics area planned for the beginning of 2018 to make room for brand additions and expansion"
"Our positioning of All Things Beauty, All in One Place gives us multiple levers to drive growth and quickly adapt to trends and changing industry dynamics"
Let me turn now to our services business
Salon sales grew 10.8% and comps 3.8% in the third quarter
"While a moderation from our rapid growth earlier in the year, these increases show that we continue to gain share and far exceed growth rates with the services industry"
"We saw some regional variation in our growth rates with slower growth in Florida and Texas, two of our biggest markets for services, reflecting disruptions from the hurricane"
The team managed labor and operating costs well and increased the profit rate of services business while investing in growth initiative
We’re in the early stages of testing our improved salon business model in two markets and we’re encouraged by the early indicators
Initial surveys of our guests reveal significantly higher engagement and satisfaction with this new approach
"As a reminder of the new guest-centric model features a simplified menu for hair and skin services, a more transparent pricing model to clearly and consistently communicate pricing to our guests, and increase training for stylists"
We believe this innovative approach is the foundation for long-term growth and share gains
"Earlier this year, we launched our Pro Team, a group of salon stylist from Redken, Matrix, L’ANZA and Wella who are in-charge of elevating the profile of the salon in Ulta Beauty, building trend collection and leading education programs for our 7,000 stylists"
The Pro Team is already making a big impact and getting a lot of attention in the salon world with extensive coverage in industry publications like Modern Salon and Behind the Chair
This publicity is positioning us as a trendsetter and helping us attract the best talent to our salon team
Now to update you on our new store program
"We opened 48 stores in the third quarter, ending the quarter with 1,058 stores"
We were able to open almost all of our 100 net new stores in our 2017 program before Black Friday weekend to take advantage of holiday traffic in sales
New stores continue to open up very strong with the class of 2017 stores exceeding its budget and IRR hurdles
"Earlier this month, we opened our first Manhattan store in a great neighborhood location in 86th and Third"
This store is off to an excellent start in its first few weeks
"Similar to the Michigan Avenue store in Chicago, we’re seeing great results in the salon after hiring a seasoned team of salon professionals"
"At the Manhattan store, it offers extended hours to accommodate early morning blowout in the salon before work or school"
"We’re pleased to report that our newly opened high-profile stores in Chicago, the Mall of America and Manhattan are all performing very well"
"Looking ahead to 2018, the majority of our 2018 real estate program has been approved and we’re on track to open up another 100 stores next year"
Now turning to our e-commerce business
"com sales grew 62.9%, representing nearly 9% of total company revenue and continuing the rapid growth we’ve seen for the past several quarters, as we enhanced our assortment, site experience and delivery capabilities"
E-commerce sales were driven by transaction growth
"Total traffic growth was up 57% and mobile traffic grew 92%, driven by investments in digital marketing"
"We relaunched our mobile site during the quarter, improving the guest experience with the redesign of the shopping card in checkout experiences"
"We also improved the credit card application experience, implementing the ability to apply and buy one transaction, which has more than doubled the number of credit card account sign ups online"
"We also gave the Ulta Beauty app a mini makeover, adding features like the ability to buy e-mail gift cards from your phone, easier use of features like checking ultimate rewards account and point balance and improved version of our try-on app, GLAMlab, a feature to enable push notifications to get alerts about the latest promotions and exclusive product launches and the capability for guest use voice search to find products"
Mobile app traffic increased more than 300% during the quarter
We continue to build our ulta
"com assortment with the addition of more online-only brands like Lime Crime, one of the first digitally native beauty brands, offering edgy makeup and hair color; Little Barn Apothecary bath products; the Persona Identity Palette created by YouTube influencer Simply Sona and exclusive to Ulta Beauty; and Milani makeup and primers"
Online-only brands accounted for a significant portion of our e-commerce growth during the quarter
"com also delivered excellent results with our signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty, The Gorgeous Hair Event, as well as online-only promotions, including platinum Perks, Beauty Sample Bag of purchase and limited-time Beauty Breaks"
We launched Shoppable Instagram in August and we’re seeing growing interest and engagement in this platform
Now turning to the development of our omni-channel capabilities
"Last quarter, we’ve mentioned our store-to-door test in 40 stores, which enabled guests to place ulta"
com orders in-store and have products delivered to their homes
We rolled out this capability chain wide at the end of the third quarter
"And while this initiative is still fairly small in terms of demand, it’s proving quite useful and satisfying guests looking for hot brands that are not available in every store, such as MAC or Morphe"
The number of omni-channel shoppers continues to steadily increase
"Guests purchasing both in-store and online now represent 9.1% of our loyalty members compared to 7.5% a year ago, and she’s spending 21.7 times more than a retail-only guest when she shops in both channels, including doubling her spend in our stores"
"And finally, to update you on our supply chain operations"
"We continue to develop capabilities and leverage economies of scale in our distribution network to deliver exceptional guest experiences, while focusing on cost optimization"
"Our DC network is forecasted to ship nearly 20% more units this year compared to 2016, with almost 10% of units supporting our e-commerce business"
"Our improved operational capabilities are supporting this growth, while capturing significant savings"
E-commerce costs for order are down 10% year-over-year with a 4.4% reduction in retail replenishment costs over the same period
"From the speed-to-guest perspective, the supply chain team has achieved a 20% reduction in retail replenishment lead times with most of our e-commerce orders processed within 24 hours of an order being placed"
"We also – we’ve also continued to implement technologies to provide greater control and visibility, supporting ongoing efforts to improve service and reduce costs"
Our DC network has continued to mature with the ramp of our new DC operating model in Greenwood and Dallas
These two facilities are expected to process nearly 85% of our e-commerce volume during the peak 2017 holiday season
"As we prepare to go live with the Fresno DC next summer, we’ll continue to see more e-com demand to fill out of our new DC operating model"
"And speaking of Fresno, construction of our new West Coast distribution center is nearly complete and hiring of the management team is well underway and we’re on track to open next summer"
"The Fresno DC will add another 670,000 square feet of capacity back in service up to 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day"
Fresno will also provide a platform to implement new technologies to increase productivity and significantly reduce transit time for our West Coast customers
"From an inventory perspective, we’ve been building our DC in-store inventory levels to prepare for the significant volume spike that we anticipate during the holiday season"
"The team has done a great job maintaining high in-stock levels and while they remain above goal, we’ve also focused on achieving our inventory turn goals"
"Inventory per door grew by 6.5%, well below our total sales comp of 10.3% in the third quarter, a solid achievement in light of the additional safety stock we built in support of our fourth quarter sales projections"
I’m also really proud of the partnership among the supply chain teams through operations and merchandising teams to ensure the seamless execution of our many new brand launches and category reflows
That completes my progress report on our strategic imperatives
"Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we’re looking forward to an exciting fourth quarter, as our teams work together to inspire our 26 million loyal guests to treat themselves and their friends and families this holiday season"
"Our merchants have planned a great assortment with lots of newness and exclusives, our marketing team is executing and compelling 360-degree plan around our Bring to Beauty Theme, including new creative for television and radio"
"Our store teams are ensuring strong execution of the planograms and events, and we’re investing in labor hours to give great guest service and our supply chain and system teams are supporting the stores on ulta"
"com with improved inventory planning, leading to higher in-stock levels, we are ready"
"And with that, I’ll turn it over Scott to discuss in more detail our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the current quarter"
"Well, first of all, I would say that that one of the great things about the Ulta Beauty business model is that we participate the All Things Beauty, All in One Place line is real"
"So we participate across all the major beauty categories, which gives us a lot of ability to drive growth in share gains and flux with category cycles"
"So I would say, first of all, we take a really macro kind of long-term view in the sense, there’s many categories within the big beauty category and there are cycles that happen"
"One thing I’ll just say is that, I come back to skincare in a minute"
But guests are just as engaged as ever in makeup
"And so if you just look at what’s happening on YouTube, or Instagram, or our own followers across channel, if you look at the trends that we see in demographics, the beauty enthusiast segment of the future Millennials, Latinas, teens"
all over index particularly in makeup
"So we feel confident that the involvement and engagement in makeup and somewhat softer current performances is fairly, it’s not a long-term trend"
"It’s about innovation, lapping over some really big kinds of innovation platforms the last couple of years"
"We also saw not only strong growth, but really strong share gains continue for us in makeup"
"Now, as you said what’s kind of cool is that we’ve seen some acceleration in some of the categories"
"So in particular, in fragrance and skincare, both accelerated in terms of growth in our share gain, and we think that has long-term life to it as well"
"Skincare, it’s really been driven by a lot of innovation and Dave can add more color to this"
"But some interesting innovation, what I call, faster, funner ways to do skincare like masks or more interesting efficacious ingredients from Korea"
"And so that’s interesting, and we think that’s good"
It has no reason to continue to not be strong profitable prestige and mass
"So we see a lot of innovation coming down the pike, I’d say, across all categories for us as we look out into fourth quarter 2018."
"Well, I would say, first of all, we love the fact that our e-commerce growth is picking up"
"And as Scott said, I think very well, we’re agnostic about it from a bottom line profit perspective, but we’re actually really positive about it as it relates to customer engagement"
"So the folks that are like 9% of our loyalty members that are on the channel, multi-channel right now by far our best guests in terms of spending almost three times the amount of somebody who’s only shopping in store, but she is also shopping even more in-store than before"
So we talked about this a lot
"It’s not a shift, it’s not a channel shift"
"It’s actually an expansion of us getting more per share wallet, so that’s all great"
"Now, of course, we’re always thinking about our physical footprint in build out and that’s something that we’re very rigorous and disciplined about"
We have no reason to change that target right now
"There’s a range for a reason, because it’s range Yes, I don’t think there’s any one point in time"
But to me the best thing is that every year our store fleet continues to perform better than a year before
So 2017 historically is ahead of budget and IRR target and we continue to see it strengthen
"So I guess, the best way to think about it is, we actually know that when we build stores, the e-commerce business also grows with it, so they actually are complimentary not stealing from each other"
And so we have no reason to think that dynamic will change
"And we of course, are very disciplined about our real estate decisions"
But we would keep that targeted range where it’s right now
"As you know, I’ll let Dave take this since he is the closest to it"
"And I’ll just add too that, we’re also actively participating with there’s a lot of social media influencer brands that are hot"
"And so, we talked about this a little bit, but Morphe, Dose of Colors, Lime Crime, these are brands that were born more through social media"
But also many of these brands most understand that the benefit of sort of merging the digital and physical is important for their guest and for our guest as well
"And so we’re seeing some nice growth with those brands, too"
"Thank you, Adrienne"
So I’ll start with your first question
"I guess, stepping back this is really, I mean, we really are playing the long game here"
And believe that Ulta Beauty has the most relevant proposition for the beauty enthusiast now into the future
"And for us, it’s really about long-term driving more guest gaining more beauty enthusiast into our loyalty programs and also capturing more per share of wallet"
So each quarter is a little bit different
"But we’re looking to drive not just long-term share gains, but really long-term engagement within our loyalty platform"
"And so this quarter was an example of, we did not want to miss the opportunity to continue to – on the momentum"
We gained $1.8 million new loyalty members this quarter
So I consider that a long-term play not a just a short-term by promotion plan
"Now we needed to drive some traffic, because there was some disruption with the hurricanes and some softness in the category"
"But for us, that’s kind of how we think about strategically long-term is how do we continue on the momentum that we have to drive and get an even bigger loyalty program, which really is, I guess, the flywheel to drive our business for the long-term"
"Yes, I’ll start with the second part of your question, and then maybe Dave you can add on the holiday piece, too"
"But I would say, that not to be redundant, but I’m really proud about the fact that we’ve got a business model that has a lot of levers and frankly, flexibility"
"And so we’ve worked really hard over the past few years to really reduce our reliance on more broad-based, broad scale just blunt instrument, I call it, to a much more sophisticated lever, marketing mix that gas allowed us to do a couple of things"
"One, a lot is to participate in things that are driving the kind of brand awareness we have today"
"I mean, they have 50% unaided brand awareness, right now it’s actually a really big deal"
"And so we’ve been able to kind of pull back on broad-based discounting and still maintain a reasonable overall marketing spend by shifting into things that are driving awareness, allowing us to participate in the social channels, where the journey is happening for people running about beauty and then do more demand creation and more targeted fashion right? So the whole point of the World Food Program is to be as targeted as we can"
"That in conjunction with exciting brands and assortment and advance and all that right, that all comes together in a great mix that allows us, I think, to be really smart and efficient"
"So there’s signs that we have to flex levers more aggressively than others, and it would be our intention to be less about price discounting and more about targeted promotions and part of what we invest in – are investing in over time as the ability to get even more personalized in everything we do"
So that’s the notion of at a time what we’re using tools to get people into royalty program
"That provides long-term benefit, because we know that our ability to target them with really exciting relevant offers that are not really relying on discounting, but just exciting offers will only increase over time"
"So, that’s kind of a long answer to your question, but that’s the goal to have leverage, have flexibility, but also continue to bias towards more targeted personalization"
Thank you
"I just like to thank our 36,000 associates for their incredible commitment to serving our guests and delivering operational excellence at a very busy time of the year"
And we thank you all for your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with all of you soon
