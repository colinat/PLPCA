"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 first quarter's earnings call"
Q1 was a much better quarter
"We saw strong growth in Luxury, continued positive momentum in Professional and a reduced net revenue decline in the Consumer Beauty division"
"We delivered significant improvement in profits, driven by better gross margin performance and strong financial discipline on the cost structure"
"We also continued making meaningful progress in our merger integration, and I'm glad to announce that, as of September 1, we have exited our third and final TSA for the ALMEA region"
"Starting with Luxury, this was the third consecutive quarter of positive top line growth"
"Luxury revenues increased 4% on an organic basis, driven by a successful innovation pipeline, excellent performance from several brands, and best-in-class in-store execution behind our launches, leading to double-digit growth in several countries"
We also introduced two successful major new products this quarter: Gucci Bloom and Tiffany's debut fragrance
"Gucci Bloom was the best fragrance launch ever in Macy's, the biggest Coty launch ever in Harrods, and the top two new product launch in every retailer we launched globally"
"The Tiffany's launch was the biggest opening day and first week in five years at Bloomingdale's, and has been a top seller at several other key retailers globally, including travel retail"
Our growth in Luxury is not limited to new launches
"In fact, philosophy had a very strong quarter, growing net revenues double digits driven by strong sell-through in the U.S"
", both in the retail channel and direct-to-consumer"
"Additionally, we also launched new campaigns for HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy, which are driving very healthy growth in these pillars"
These are clear results of what the new Coty is able to achieve
"In our Professional division, the first quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth with net revenues increasing 1% organically"
"Our hair business grew across all regions and we are seeing continued strong momentum on Wella Professionals, particularly in color"
"In addition, System Professional continues making good progress on its global rollout, growing double digits in the quarter"
"Additionally, OPI has continued to grow in North America, with international markets being our next area of focus"
Consumer Beauty net revenue declined 8% on an organic basis and this remains a key focus for us
"The decline was driven by declines in some of our brands, particularly retail hair, combined with continued weakness in the global mass beauty market"
"Although I'm not happy with the Consumer Beauty divisional performance to date, I'm starting to see signs of a stabilizing business"
"We're achieving this by actively engaging with retailer customers to amplify the in-store shopping experience to drive capital growth, working on accelerating our time to market with on-trend collections and new products, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation, and driving our e-commerce efforts"
"For instance, in line with our goal to be faster to market, we were able to bring Clairol recent Color Crave hair makeup innovation to market in just six months"
"Where available, this exciting new product has outperformed its main competitor"
"And, as such, we expect to see increased shelf space allocation, which coupled with a game-changing innovation coming to Clairol in the second half, should further boost the brand"
"While we continue to address challenges in North America and Europe, ALMEA continues to have several bright spots with highlights in Mexico, Australia, and Brazil"
"Speaking of Brazil, this business continues to be a standout success story for Coty"
Our year-to-date sellout is growing at double the rate of the underlying market
"With a strong pipeline of innovations in our local and global brands, we remain confident in this story and, as an example, we just became the second largest player by volume in the deodorant market, doubling our share in 18 months after increasing our focus on this segment three years ago"
I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished in Brazil and believe it's a clear example of what the company is capable of achieving via strategic M&A and focus on execution
"As you know, we are also preparing the relaunch of several brands"
In the recently announced COVERGIRL relaunch is another example of the strength of the new Coty
"The brand's new statement of purpose, I Am What I Make Up, is COVERGIRL's biggest reinvention in its 60 years history"
Our powerful relaunch film featuring six boundary breaking in cultural change agents COVERGIRLs result in astounding 4.1 billion impressions and 11 million views in a matter of few days
I'm looking forward to sharing more good news in the second half of fiscal 2018 as the product and fixtures are rolled out in stores
"We expect the combination of this brand initiatives, improving in market execution and consumer-focused communication strategy to support the gradual improvement in Consumer Beauty revenue trends"
"As I said before, it will still take time for the full recovery of the Consumer Beauty division"
"These positive results are directly linked to the growth strategy we've been articulating to you in the past several quarters, focus on repositioning select brands in order to reconnect them with consumers, building on their already strong brand equity, making significant changes to our innovation product development process in parts of the organization driven by faster and state-of-the-art execution, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce, collaborating even more closely with retailers to significantly ramp up our in-store execution"
I want to be clear that there is still much work to be done to achieve our goals
We have only just started this journey and fiscal 2018 will be an important milestone in this regard
"After having put the foundation of the new Coty in place, we expect this year to be one-off stabilization"
"And while results are likely to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, the improving net revenue trends give me confidence that the growth strategy outlined above is moving Coty gradually into a path of full recovery"
"With regards to our cost control, following a disappointing fourth quarter, I told you that we would make the issue a top priority, and we have"
"This quarter, our management team put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our signature program, which is expected to lead to help improvement in our adjusted operating income over time"
I want to also highlight the positive results we are seeing from our M&A strategy
"I'm pleased to say that Hypermarcas is driving very positive results in Brazil, where we're previously lacking scale, and ghd is bringing complementary technology and products to our Professional division"
Younique is another example of a great addition to the new Coty
"From day one, Younique has been a purpose-led business focused on empowering women"
"Moreover, Younique's successful positioning and the intersection of social media and e-commerce is a best-in-class example of how brands can best connect with customers, a central objective for Coty as we work to reposition several of our key brands"
"The continued growth in Younique active presenter base, which has increased nearly 20% since we began our partnership coupled with the continued strong double-digit top line growth, is a testament to the ongoing success and viability of this business model"
"These strategic and complementary additions to our business fit our M&A criteria, and overall, our acquisition have performed very well"
"Further, the recent Burberry acquisition complements our expertise and leadership in luxury fragrances, accelerates our presence in the premium category and provides a strong platform to enter into the fast growing prestige color cosmetic category"
"All of these plans, launches, and accomplishment would not be possible without the new culture and mindset that we've worked so hard to nurture at Coty"
"Our new value of own it and drive it, which focuses on accountability and execution, will be one of the keys to delivering sustainable growth and industry-leading margins over time"
"We also have a great company purpose of celebrating and liberating the diversity of your beauty, which has been received extremely well by our employees and which distinguishes us in the industry"
"At Coty, we have decided to take a stand to fight prejudice with a specific focus on ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and gender inequality"
"And I'm excited that we're partnering with Global Citizen to fight the prejudice and discrimination that creates barrier to self-expression, individuality, and inclusion"
"Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect to continue to deliver on our announced synergies, finalize the streamlining of our brand portfolio and re-launch several of our key brands"
"With this program, we aim to deliver improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, as well as a healthy margin improvement over the balance of the year"
"In closing, while there is much work to be done, I firmly believe our strategy is working"
And I'm confident that all our efforts will lead to Coty becoming a new global leader and challenger in beauty
I will now turn the call over to Patrice
"Thanks for the question, Joe"
"Let me start by reiterating what Patrice said, which is that our long-term focus is on achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins"
And then this is in line with our investment thesis that we referred in our road show at the time of the merger
And this is how we are making business decisions
"Now, it's fair to say, as you know, that we have inherited a business which was smaller in revenues, but not in SG&A and, therefore, smaller in operating margin than our expectation at the time of the road show"
"And because of this, when you combine also with the business challenges that we have faced last year and our better visibility into the aspect of the business that we have now since we exited the TSA, we believe that it will take us longer to get to the $1.53, even with our objectives of best-in-class operating margin of higher teens"
"Thank you, Joe"
"So, let me try to take one after the other"
"So, first on the cost structure"
"So, we told you that we would make this issue a top priority and we have"
"This quarter, the management team has put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our synergy program, which is expected to lead to a healthy improvement in our adjusted operating income over time"
"So, what we have done is to significantly strengthen our cost control measures on expenses"
"We have also taken some measures to consolidate some commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency as I said in the script, and also deploying a number of global standard of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our sales force"
"So, some of these initiatives have already led to tangible signs of progress during the first quarter and we are going to make some further progress in the year to come and our overall profitability will make good progress even though, as we said before, the bulk of our synergies from the P&G Beauty merger have yet to be achieved and are more second-half-of-the-year skewed"
It's also fair to say that I'm not sure that the Q4 was a good benchmark and Q4 results reflected a certain non-recurring cost that were not included as onetime
"For example, there were a number of Coty employees who were not fully dedicated to the integration, but who worked somehow on the integration, part time, and we did incur some costs related to supporting the TSA exit"
"So, now all this is over because we have successfully exited all the TSA, and now we can really focus on driving the business going forward"
"I'll answer all your question in more or less the order you asked me, okay? So, regarding the outlook, we expect to continue to deliver on the previously-announced synergies"
We're going to finalize on the streamlining of our brand portfolio and relaunch several of the key brands and I'll get to the relaunch in a second
"Now, if we take all these programs together, we aim to deliver; improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, as I said, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, which means roughly flat"
"And when I look at the different promos that we're doing, clearly we have an improvement in the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty, that is a part of the objective that I just discussed and within Consumer Beauty we have a couple of relaunches which are quite important; the first one is, the COVERGIRL, which we just announced in October and I mentioned early a very positive sign of a reaction from the market on COVERGIRL"
And but we also have the relaunch of Clairol
"On Clairol, we just launched a product called Color Crave which is an hair makeup product, which we launched off the classical less shelf reset windows with the U.S"
retailers
And clearly we expect to gain some shelf space with this product once it's able to go in the normal shelf
"Plus we are going to relaunch, also launch a second big innovation on Clairol in the second half of fiscal 2018 and therefore we expect these two relaunches to help us improving the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty"
"Looking at the shelf space, I think it's important to remind that the shelf space decisions that impacted us were made prior to our acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business and the impact of those decisions continue to impact our results today and will continue for a while, because we need to annualize those decisions in the second half of 2018. And you know that not all the retailers redo their shelf at the same time"
"But based on encouraging conversations that we had with retailers regarding the restaging of the COVERGIRL and Clairol and other various brands and also, sharing our innovation pipeline, we believe that we should retain most of the space for our key brands"
"And the last question, I think, was e-commerce"
E-commerce is important for us
It's an area of focus for me and for the business
I already mentioned this in previous calls
"And we don't disclose e-commerce sales, but I can confirm they were growing at a healthy above the market rate in both our Consumer Beauty and Luxury division, although from a low base"
I hope that I have answered all your questions
"Talking about retail color, I think there is a couple of things"
"And one of the things that I did mention in the past that this category has been always treated very, very functionally by everybody"
"And, I think this needs to be treated more as a beauty category"
"Now, this transformation is not immediate"
"And regarding our brands, Clairol, this has been a brand that didn't receive a lot of investment attention for many years"
And I did refer to this brand in the past as a neglected brand
"So, from our point of view, we have a much stronger pipeline"
"I did mention one of the launches that happened in the last few months and I did kind of give a preview that's going to be a big launch coming in the second half of 2018. But I believe that we have a very strong pipeline, which covers both the functional and the beauty area or the beauty part of this brand and this category"
"And I think that our plans are strong, and that's why we believe that over time, we will be able to recover lost ground on this brand, and we've clearly come back to much more positive performance"
"So, I believe that the experience in the store and innovation are both part"
"And clearly, you have the communications or the positioning"
"This brand also requires a bit of a different way of communicating to consumers, and we are working also on the relaunch from that point of view coming in the second half of 2018. Looking at Consumer Beauty, which is what you mentioned, as I said, because we're doing all this, we believe that we have a solid strategy in place and we are excited about the relaunches of several of our Consumer Beauty brands"
And that's why we aim for the net revenue trends to improve over the year
"But as I said, it will still take time for a full recovery of Consumer Beauty"
"Good morning, Dara"
"Look, full recovery, as I said, we are defining 2018 as a year of stabilization"
"And that's why we believe that our sales in the second half will be roughly comparable with previous year, roughly flat"
"And in terms of category growth, we believe that we are exposed more or less to around 2% of growth"
"So over time, we expect of course to generate a similar level to the category growth, and then over time to grow share as well and become over-performing versus the market that we are exposed"
But we're not going to put a timeline behind this path
"What is important is, for us, that 2018 is giving us signs, is making us confident about stabilizing the business so that we can therefore take it from there and go to the next step"
"So, taking your first question Wendy, in terms of rollout of COVERGIRL, yes, there will be some inventory destocking in the coming quarter, preparing for the arrival of old and new products, the new packaging, the new visuals on the shelf"
"And in terms of how we are implementing this launch, there will always be some parts of the brand which is all the new innovation pipeline, which will be in and out, which means it's going to be a cut, right"
And then the rest will be probably more of a phase-in and you can understand why depending on cost and inventory or on implementation as well
"And in terms of – your second question was about Burberry, and regards to the inventory and when we expect some sales, as you can imagine, we only became the owner of Burberry"
"So, we are in the process of understanding the level of stock there is in the market"
So we're not able to make any comments about it
"And so, we expect it to prepare our plans that we are already preparing, which will be strong plans"
"And at some point, really, we will start recording sales"
"But I don't have a visibility to give you about the exact month when we will be able to do that because, exactly, all the questions you asked on the stock"
"Regarding the third question, Patrice, do you want to take the one about the 6% to 8%?"
"Thanks, Jason, for the questions"
"So, regarding the restage of COVERGIRL, as you can imagine, it's a competitive restage"
"We have over 60,000 doors in the U.S"
where COVERGIRL is distributed
"So, it's a complex one, but so far everything that we are preparing is absolutely being prepared very well and it's going in the right direction"
"And, yes, we're going to have an inventory reduction as I said before in my previous answer because that's what we're going to do to ensure that the arrival of all the new products and new packaging will fit faster and will paste faster into the billboards, the walls"
"And what I can tell you why we're confident is, look, since we have announced the restage with the new positioning and the reaction has been truly, truly positive"
"I mean, we did something in terms of the positioning that is absolutely relevant and when we talk about the freedom of self-expression, when we talk about creating any version of yourself with makeup, but this is truly having the right reactions"
"But the one that makes me more confident is the reaction of our retailers, the customers, our partners"
They are also the ones that are telling us that the way we are preparing this is absolutely superior to anything that has been done before by Coty and I guess also they have visibility over what they see in the market from other brands
And this reaction makes me confident of course that we're going to have an increased productivity once we're able to bring the new news and the new visuals in the stores as well
"Your second question I think it was about e-commerce in Professional Beauty and look, yes, I did mention a healthy growth above market rate in Consumer Beauty and Luxury because that's clearly very good"
"In Professional Beauty, we also have a growing e-commerce business is smaller because, as you could imagine, Professional Beauty is mostly focused on salon professionals, so hairdressers, manicurists and so on"
"But there has been some shift as well because some of the channels are blurring, so we're working actively in this area as well"
"And you mentioned an app to look at on how you look and therefore being able at look at yourself to choose the right shade and so on, we have something absolutely like that on our brand, Clairol, which is going very well because it's absolutely one of the new way that consumers want to engage with brands and we have absolutely some of this technology as well"
Yeah
"I think your second question, Lauren, was about the net working capital already negative, which is very good"
"This is a strong achievement, and we're very proud"
"But we're also confident that we have a bit more to go on net working capital, and we keep working on it"
"I think, as we said, we're still at the beginning of our journey, and we're putting in place a series of ideas and actions to improve this"
"So, I think, there is a bit more to come"
Yeah
"I think your second question regards it's more of a quarterly outlook, which we really don't do"
"What I can tell you is, as we said, we aim to see an improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year"
"And in the second half, our top line, we aim to be roughly flattish or comparable to the previous year"
"Now, when you look on a healthy margin improvement, which we aim to have over the balance of the year, this is where we aim, we expect to have a more pronounced impact in Q4 given the lower base of last year"
On the margin
"So, Andrea on your first question, which is the destock in Q2, this refers mostly to clearly some of the activities in the re-launches we're doing in the Consumer Beauty division and it's true we will have some destocking, but we still expect the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty to improve as a trend over the year and in the next quarters, starting from Q2. Regarding your second question, which is more of a question about the U.S"
"mass channel, you mentioned color cosmetics"
"Mass channel is a really important channel for all the beauty players and there has been some shift clearly in the way the consumer shop brands, e-commerce, specialty store and so on"
"But, there will always be a place for products with strong value propositions, so for beauty brands with this characteristic"
"And so, our focus is truly to build a closer partnership with the retail customers and ensure that we create an amazing consumer experience, in store and online"
"So, this means right assortment"
It means faster innovation
"It means yes, yes, speed to market and so on"
"So, that's where our focus is and we're working with our retailer partners to really bring back up the traffic in store through doing this"
"One of the things that we did recently is this new concept store in New York called The STORY, which is a sort of experiential playground in which we test a lot of digital innovation around color cosmetics in this let's say experiential store"
"And what we're trying to do is to see some of these ideas because now we have the learnings of consumer interacting there, can go back to the classical standard retailing environment"
"So, we are really working well to try to change this"
"Thanks, Mark, so a great question"
"So actually, it's a good opportunity for me to reiterate that our investment thesis is still very valid"
"So, our investment thesis is that there is usually a direct correlation between gross margin and EBIT across the FMCG industry but in beauty industry"
And what we want to demonstrate is that we should be in a position to achieve a best-in-class operating margin
Why? Because the level of investment that we currently have on our business is according to us roughly the right level of investment
"There might be some difference between quarters here and there, between geographies, between segments"
"The overall, at Coty, Inc"
"boundaries, the level of investment that we have is about to be the right one, which means that the overall level of synergies of $750 million should fall bottom line"
This represents roughly between 700 and 800 basis points of operating margin
That's where we see the best-in-class operating margin
"As I mentioned, Rosie, we have already two divisions, Luxury and Professional Beauty, that have been growing for quite a while"
"So, the key focus of their attention is Consumer Beauty"
The confidence in Luxury and in Professional Beauty comes from having seen the performance of our brands in the market
"I mentioned in my script that the launch of Gucci Bloom and the launch of Tiffany have been successful so far, but it's not just these two new product launches"
We see market share growth in HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy and several other brands
"So overall, our portfolio both in terms of the classic pillars in Luxury and, but also in the innovation it brings to market, that includes philosophy, is performing quite well and, of course, that gives us confidence"
"When I look at Professional Beauty, the growth that we're having in hair, which is one of the two category that we work in Professional Beauty, is actually positive"
And it has been positive now for several quarters
And this is the bulk of our business
"This is where we believe we are growing market share, especially in color, which is the core part of Wella Professional"
"And we expect to have this positive momentum and performance to continue because of the strength of our brands, but also the strength of the capabilities that we have in the professional business, in the professional service business"
"And regarding Consumer Beauty, it's really, first of all, there are some spring and some excellent results that we're seeing in, especially in ALMEA"
"And so, I mentioned Mexico, Australia, Brazil, but we have also some other, Bourjois continues to grow market share both in Europe, but also in Russia, Middle East"
We have Rimmel having market share growth in several countries
"So, there are several examples that clearly gives us this confidence of improving trends"
"But as I said, Consumer Beauty will take time before a full recovery"
"This is, clearly, the largest division we have"
We have faced some challenges
We continue to face some challenges and that's why we're going to continue to implement all our actions to implement the recovery
"So, Jonathan, Younique is clearly an acquisition, a very strategic acquisition that we are very pleased with, and it continues to grow double digits"
"So, the performance that we mentioned at the time of the acquisition continues to be true now that it's clearly under the partnership with us"
"In terms of additional KPIs that you ask, there is one that is very telling, which is the sign-ups, so the basic recruitment of presenters"
"And right now, we are approaching 100,000 presenters totally, overall, with over 100,000 presenters that joined us in Q1 2018 alone"
"So, I guess, I think combining the net revenue, double-digit growth and the growth of the presenters, that clearly makes us satisfied with the performance"
"In terms of the role that direct selling can play within Coty, I think that we have made what I would call a very strategic and successful acquisition with Younique"
"We are very satisfied with it, and I believe direct selling has clearly a role to play within Coty given the growing size of Younique"
"But the other reason why I believe that this is so relevant is because of the direct link between the presenters and the consumers, and this is very, very relevant in the current market where individualized and customized approach to consumers is a big trend"
"And having a 100,000 presenters who are our brand ambassadors, who talk to millions of consumers out there on a daily basis, almost on an individual basis, because sometimes they do virtual parties with few people, but most of the time is individual basis, to me is also key to the performance that we're seeing in Younique"
