"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone"
Fiscal year 2017 was another successful year for our company
"We build momentum in every quarter, pivoted our business through the channels and categories driving global prestige beauty, created exciting new products, reached new consumers, and strengthened our multiple engines of growth"
"When the year began, we said we expected our sales to accelerate as demands progressed and they did, building each quarter and culminating in an exceptional final quarter and full year"
"The fourth quarter results came largely from terrific strengths in China, travel retail and online, as well as from many of our brands including our latest acquisitions"
"In this new fiscal year, we expect our effective strategy to continue to drive our momentum leading to strong sales and profit growth"
"For the full year, we delivered sales growth of 7%, approximately 2 points ahead of global prestige beauty, enabling us to once again gain share"
"This is the eighth consecutive year we generated a strong performance and outperformed the industry, demonstrating the sustainability of our strategy despite inevitable external headwinds"
"This year was marked by greater economic and geopolitical volatility and terrorism, which curtailed demand in several countries"
"The trend of consumers shifting their shopping preferences by channel accelerated, which resulted in declining traffic in some U.S"
brick-and-mortar department stores
"At the same time, global competition intensified as new beauty brands and thousands of new products competed for a share of consumer wallets"
"Despite these challenges, we strengthened our growth engines and created formidable new ones, which was evident in higher sales across our major product categories"
"Through our seasonal and luxury brands, we have reinvigorated our fragrance category"
We also solidified our leadership in the fast-growing makeup category with the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA
These exciting brands anchor our portfolio with millennial consumers who often prefer to shop in specialty-multi retailers and online
Central to our success was pivoting our business to capture new consumers
"We did this by increasing our exposure to the fastest-growing prestige channels, strengthening our brand portfolio, investing in key geography and enhancing our digital and social media communications"
"Consumers have a growing emotional attachment for their beauty experience, strong loyalty to product performance, a desire for high-touch service and a preference for experiential channels"
These are the pillars of our Company’s success that we will continue to build on
"In fiscal 2017, we took decisive steps to gain a more significant presence globally in specialty-multi retailers and increased our penetration by 40%"
"We have historically been well-represented in specialty-multi internationally, and we reinforced our position with new and existing retailers"
"In Europe, some of our brands expanded in Sephora and Douglas"
"In Asia, our brands went into more Sephora stores in China and Southeast Asia and captured new opportunities with the brand-building specialty-multi retailers that are emerging"
Clinique was our first brand in Eveandboy in Thailand and in Olive Young in Korea
In the U.S
", our high-end La Mer and Jo Malone brands entered Sephora’s flagship stores and began selling on its website, joining many of other brands – of our brands that are already successful there"
"In addition, Estée Lauder and MAC opened in selected ULTA Beauty stores and on ulta"
"com, which helped them reach new target consumer, especially in smaller cities"
"E-commerce continued to be vibrant and our business accelerated, growing 33%, with strong global growth"
"Our brands opened sites in new countries and with various retailers, planting seeds for future gains"
"In the fourth quarter, we launched MAC on China popular Tmall, and it was the platform’s largest prestige beauty launch"
"Our travel retail sales grew more than 20%, generating the best gains in five years due to strong demand for our product and wider availability of our brand portfolio in large productive airports"
Passenger traffic grew high single-digits and a resurgence of Chinese tourists helped drive our strong performance
"We remain the leader in makeup and skin care combined in travel retail, and our makeup sales soared, which lifted many brands"
One of those was Tom Ford
"Its travel retail business more than doubled, fueled by Chinese consumer who coveted the brand’s high-end makeup and fragrances"
Our brands continue to be highly desirable
"Our best performers were many of our mid-size and luxury brands, which grew double-digits and helped fuel our makeup, skin care, and fragrance categories"
"As an example, La Mer’s success stemmed from driving trial with compelling innovation and repeat purchases with core products"
"The Estée Lauder brand returned to solid mid-single digit global growth for the year, delivering gains in both makeup and skin care"
It was well positioned to take advantage of the resurgence in China and travel retail and strengthen its Europe franchises with innovative new products
"Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, and the Pure Color Envy lipstick lines all grew double-digits"
The brand also benefited from effective social media and digital market which led to its top ranking in the L2 China Beauty Index
We strategically invested in key geographies to match success
"Countries represented more than one quarter of our sales grew double-digits, including emerging markets of China and Russia as well as developed countries like Italy"
We attribute the strong results to locally relevant products and communications and targeted expanded consumer reach
"Thanks to a strong economy and growing desire for prestige beauty, demand from Chinese consumer climbed, both in the local market as they travel the world"
"Our China business accelerated throughout the year, delivering outstanding growth of more than 40% in the fourth quarter and 90% for the year"
"A record 133 million Chinese tourists traveled last year, as we see this momentum continuing, which should positively impact our business across the globe"
Enhancing our social media and digital engagement is a priority across our portfolio
Our brands leveraged a growing number of influencers
"And as we grew our experience, we gain share in our media value, ending the year as the number one prestige beauty company in the U.S"
according to Tribe Dynamics
"The intersection of social media, digital marketing, and e-commerce is integral to our brand strategies and we have a digital first mind-set throughout the company at this point"
"In fiscal 2017, we continue to direct more advertising dollars to the digital space"
"Nearly half of our visible A&P spending globally was digital, up significantly from the year before"
"In other areas, we began implementing several programs under our Leading Beauty Forward initiative"
"We augmented our digit talent, capped expenses, and reinvested in high-growth areas to position us to compete more effectively in the environment that lies ahead"
"With the prestige beauty landscape shifting rapidly, we are proactively positioning ourselves to capture the new ways consumers are engaging with beauty"
"To continue to lead and win, we will leverage our company strengths; our broad prestige brand portfolio, superior product quality, creativity, talent, and brand building distribution all across our many geographies"
Let me now discuss the focus of our fiscal year 2018 strategy
"We will continue to connect our brands to high growth, brand-building channels to align with how and where consumers are shopping"
"We expect specialty-multi, online, travel retail, and freestanding store will continue their strong growth"
Dennis will discuss the online segment shortly
"In specialty-multi, we have captured a new consumer by matching our brands with global retailers that are the right fit in collaborating to drive trial, repeat purchase and regimen usage"
"For example, MAC is opening in Sephora’s top stores in Brazil and we launched in the specialty multi-channel in Asia-Pacific"
"We are rolling out Too Faced in Sephora in most European markets, including France and, in Douglas, in Germany"
In the U.S
", La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford will solidify their distribution in Sephora while Estée Lauder, MAC and Clinique will extend their presence in ULTA"
"In addition, Bumble and bumble is launching on ulta"
com this weekend followed by 500 ULTA stores
"In travel retail, we are building on our strength in skin care, further growing our makeup and fragrance categories"
"We are introducing some of our newer brands, opening more doors in high traffic airports, developing new store formats, ensuring we have locally relevant product in major travel corridors"
"We expect the higher passenger traffic coupled with effective marketing to increase conversion, will lead to strong sales growth again this year"
We are enhancing the experience of our freestanding stores by adding more open sell environments such as in MAC redesign of its Time Square flagship
"MAC will offer different shopping option across its stores, which should strengthen productivity"
"Throughout our more than 1,400 global freestanding stores, we are adding more omni-channel capabilities to connect them with online"
"Globally, department stores are an important brand-building channel that provide high-touch service, and we are investing by modernizing our counters in our service model in the best performing doors"
Many international department store continue to generate very healthy growth especially those in high traffic touristic destinations like Harrods or Selfridges in London where our business is robust
"In several other markets such as China or Italy, department stores are delivering strong gains"
Our biggest challenge has been in some U.S
"brick-and-mortar department stores, which are struggling from falling foot traffic especially in smaller malls and touristic driven doors"
department store represents approximately 17% of our global sales last year
And we are encouraged by new signs of strength in some retailers’ top doors
"We will leverage debt activity by improving our merchandising, our service, our communication, and our sampling and we are also collaborating with U.S"
"department stores to boost that business online, which is growing strongly"
We expect our makeup and fragrance categories to lead our growth
"As the global leader in prestige makeup, we are leveraging individual strengths of our many makeup brands to cater to different consumers"
We will drive our luxury and our seasonal fragrance portfolio by strengthening the brands we recently acquired and supporting and Jo Malone and Tom Ford excellent momentum
"In skin care, our sales improved last year and we anticipate even better growth this year supported by exciting innovation and more robust consumer demand"
"Looking at our three biggest brands, we expect Estée Lauder to, again, deliver solid growth"
"We also anticipate improvements at MAC, its international business has remained strong"
And it plans to open 200 new ULTA stores in the U.S
by fiscal year-end
Clinique has enjoyed good momentum in China and travel retail in recent months in recent response to new launches such as Fresh Pressed Serum with pure vitamin C and we believe its results will also improve
We will continue to reallocate resources and add talents to our social media programs which have become a critical component of beauty marketing
Our brands are aligning with authentic and locally relevant influencers and amplifying their storytelling to ensure that their content is differentiated and memorable
Consumers are purchasing beauty products more frequently than in the past partly because they can quickly and easily order online
"This is especially true for our hero products and franchises, which generate more triumph in bringing new consumer as well as repeat business, which is more profitable"
We have robust cadence of launches planned with an emphasis on strengthening core franchises
"As an example, Estée Lauder just introduced Advanced Night Repair eye concentrate matrix which incorporates innovative technology and has been well received"
"It also launched a new formula of its best-selling Double Wear foundation, which is a top recruiting product in many markets, attracting both millennials and ageless consumers"
Foundations are a large and high loyalty subcategory and many other brands like Clinique are introducing new formulas
It’s Even Better glow makeup is off to a strong start
MAC Next to Nothing lightweight foundation is a departure from the brand’s full coverage makeups and should continue to be a strong recruitment product this year
"In skin care, La Mer is rolling out two new types of moisturizer to support its iconic Crème de La Mer product lineup including a lotion with a matte finish and we expect a strong consumer response"
"Clinique launched Fresh Pressed serum and a supercharged version of Moisture Surge a few months ago, each to terrific perception and they should continue to be a major sales driver for the brand this year"
"To gain insight and help drive decisions across innovation, social media, and marketing, we are using much more analytics"
"We expect our investment in advertising to increase and comprise a greater percent of sales with digital media, the fastest growing outlet"
"We will advance more programs and the Leading Beauty Forward, allowing us to drive further efficiency, provide more fuel, reallocate resources to high growth area in advertising and better leverage sales growth"
"In closing, we are extremely proud of our performance in fiscal 2017. I want to thank our global employees and my executive team for their leadership and ability to effectively execute change across the organization, which is an important competitive advantage for our company"
We are fortunate to operate in a highly desirable industry they are focused on the many opportunities in our future
We are confident in our ability to win
"We will achieve our goals by leveraging our successful strategy that is based on multiple engine of growth, a well-diversified business, superior talent and creativity and unmatched product quality and branding"
"As we have shown this past year, we are executing our change agenda with excellence and speed"
"As we drive our momentum, we will continue to embrace a changing landscape, push the boundaries of possibility and pivot to tomorrow’s opportunity as consumer preferences evolve"
"As I mentioned, we are instilling a digital-first mind-set throughout our company"
And now Dennis McEniry who has led our online business for the past 17 years will discuss this exciting area
Dennis?
"And on the contour of the cadence, in fact, the activity also – the base of the second six months would be stronger than the base of the first six months"
"As you remember, we had the first quarter last year at plus 2%, 3%"
And so that’s the other factor that we would need to expect
"So in our estimate, we do expect a stronger top line in the first six months from the second six months"
"But we expect also very strong and solid second six months and as we said, a 7% to 8% for the year"
"On the second question, on your question on Amazon, I mean, we distribute into brand-building distribution, which exercise the key drivers of our prestige beauty including High-Touch services"
And so we are ready to distribute in channels where those criterias are fully respected
We do distribute in some global e-commerce platforms like Tmall where those criterias are respected
"At this point we do not distribute in Amazon, and in our fiscal year 2018 plan and estimates, there is no distribution in Amazon included"
"Yes, no, absolutely, no"
We are really strongly collaborating with our partners in department store to increase traffic
And I mentioned that – but I mentioned merchandising
"We are relooking at merchandising activity and we are relooking at our counters, at our system of engagements in store, and we are making some progress, in my opinion"
"But obviously most importantly is the way innovation gets executed, and the way social media gets executed on the innovation is also an important element to contribute to traffic building again"
"The third big factor, we are working very aggressively with our partners with online"
"And they’re making excellent progress online, and we are making on our business very good progress on e-commerce with them as well, and that’s also important"
"The other important thing that e-commerce is increasing the frequency of purchase of our consumers because their repurchase is readily available, and sometimes in the past, people would have waited to repurchase their regular preferred product to the next visit"
Now they don’t need to wait
So basically all the gaps of people in usage or repeated usage of product are being filled by the user online
"That’s also very true also in the department store channel, and we are leveraging this reality"
"We are seeing some initial progress in the strong doors, and as I said in my prepared remark, the problem remains in the smaller malls where traffic for the moment is not yet strong"
But I’m optimistic that we may see – we may have in front of us a moment of improvement in this area in fiscal year 2018.
"So on the first question, as I said, all of our brand – our company is 100% focused on prestige luxury beauty, meaning that all of our brands without exception are distributed in brand-building distribution proven to have all the driver of prestige"
So there will not be exception for brands like – any brand
"And Clinique, by the way, is very much a key prestige brand in our portfolio"
"On Asia, yes, 40% is a big number, so I’m not going to say 40% is sustainable"
But a double-digit continuous growth in this moment looks very sustainable because there are several dynamics that are playing in the China situation
"First of all, the growth in China is depending a lot from the lower import duty that’s been passed on to pricing into the local product"
This has pushed the market
Then the second big dynamic is that the Chinese consumers are passionate about makeup and fragrances more and more
So China historically was really driven by skincare
"Today, China is driven by three engines, two of which on a very dynamic growth"
"So this is proven by our retail growth in quarter four, where we had for example some brands like MAC that just doubled the business in one quarter now, obviously helped by the team who launched"
"But still, the growth in the same-door brick-and-mortar was outstanding, and the same for our Bobbi Brown and the same for our Estée Lauder makeup, where historically Estée Lauder was very successful on skincare only is now adding a very important leg in makeup"
"This phenomenon is going to continue, in our opinion, and that’s why it would be sustainable"
"Third point in China, we see growth from department store, from Sephora, from freestanding store, from online; it’s really across and it’s across all the cities"
We are in 170 cities
"When we look at our online sales, where the purchases come from, an enormous amount of these purchases come from cities we do not operate in brick-and-mortar, which makes the distribution in China efficient, but also the opportunity to grow new consumers come from cities where we do not operate today"
"And then finally, the portfolio fragrance is going to get traction for the industry and for us, particularly Jo Malone and Tom Ford at this point"
So I believe there is a lot of traction and a lot of fundamentals in China in this moment which is very strong
"Now, you asked about Korean brands"
"Yes, in this moment Korean brands in China are weaker than usual and this may not be the sustainable part of the story"
"But that’s why I wanted first to explain the sustainable part of the story because I believe that even when the Korea brands demand had to stabilize, I think we will continue to see good traction in China"
MAC U.S
"is improving, that has still been declining in the last quarter"
"So our expectation is that the brand will improve by better innovation, stronger social media, improvement in store and obviously activities, which are about the assortment and the marketing plans of the brand, which are in evolution to better match the consumer expectation and the consumer evolution"
"And also the distribution, MAC is still very much exposed in the U.S"
to the foot traffic of brick-and-mortar department stores
And so this will be for some time
And so we will – we are working to improve MAC trend in the U.S
as well
"But for the moment, we are assuming that MAC in the U.S"
will get the majority of the improvement from the marketing I said and from the ULTA distribution that I quoted in my prepared remarks
The rest of the benefit will come from the international business
"Most importantly, I want to underline that MAC online in the U.S"
", as was explained in the prepared remark of Dennis, grew 29% last year and we are expecting this to continue"
"So in summary, better marketing, better in-store activities, more social media, ULTA distributions, strong online are the positives that should create the improvements of MAC And we are for the moment not assuming an enormous improvement in the brick-and-mortar department store part in our estimates but we are working on it actively"
I’ll start with – to say your question is if the consumer will get accustomed to promotion
"I mean, they are – consumers are segmented, and there are certain consumers that do wait for promotional opportunities to buy and this is not new"
This has always been the case
And there are other consumers that don’t
"But on average, I just want to make you think that the growing part of the business is the non-promoted one"
And the growing – the fastest-growing channels are the channels that promote the least
"And so in total, I would say that prestige beauty is from a consumer standpoint is an industry that need a moderate amount of promotions"
And then where there are excessive promotions is a short-term event that generally doesn’t generate a change in consumer behaviors
And then I think Tracey will address Leading Beauty Forward
So I’m not sure I understand completely the question
"But no, we don’t see any change in the dynamic of the industry"
"Actually, let me take the opportunity to explain one important thing"
"Obviously, the industry is based on trial and repurchase"
What the change of the last few years is that the trial activity has become more competitive
"There are more brands that have been in some cases promotions, they’ve been more active"
"And so, the world of trial has become more competitive"
But the world of trial tends to be an investment
"The world of repurchase, loyalty, actually has not changed a lot"
"The loyalty level on our brands are improving in some cases, stable in others"
The repurchase rate remains very high for our hero SKUs
"So, what’s happening is that the repurchase is still driven by product quality and by product performance and by brand loyalty"
And those things are not changing much less
"Now, it happened that the majority of the profitability is in the repurchase gain"
"And so, the brands and the companies that own the repurchase gain are owning more of the profit and more of the cash"
"And the trial gain which is becoming more competitive is what we are all reacting to, improving our social media activation, our innovation, our activation in-store and all the rest"
"Promotion is only one element of how this is evolving and, frankly, not the biggest one in my opinion"
"So, on stats and then Tracey, you take SMI"
"So, on Clinique"
Clinique is growing in Asia
Clinique is growing in Europe
Clinique is growing in Latin America
I’ll ask Dennis in a second to speak about Clinique online
Fresh Pressed has been a success
There are several aspect in the Clinique business which is growing
Clinique in brick-and-mortar U.S
department store is declining
"And since this is still an important part of Clinique business, obviously, this is offsetting some of the positive moments"
"Sorry, then you asked about specialty, Clinique is growing in specialty in the U.S"
"Dennis, on online?"
Yes
"And then on MAC again, as I said before, I already answered the question on what type of positive signs from MAC which is, MAC international and MAC online, ULTA, MAC in the U.S"
", the improvements in MAC marketing activity, et cetera"
"But yes, the two areas of MAC which are still taking the brand down are brick-and-mortar brand store and freestanding store U.S"
But freestanding store outside of the U.S
keep growing profitably
"So, those are the two areas where we are working to further turn around the MAC However, to be clear, the expectation in fiscal year 2018 is MAC to grow because between the positive and these two areas still to be fixed, the positive are much bigger than these two areas still to be fixed"
"Yes, I would like to take the opportunity of this question to make one thing noticeable, that we have double-digit growth in many of these channels"
"But if you just take the combination of travel retail, specialty-multi, online, you arrive, just with these three, at well about one-third of the company"
"And this is growing very strongly and very double-digit, more than 20% each one of these channels, et cetera"
"So, we are in a situation from a channel diversification that we have more than one-third of the company growing in the high-20s and that’s very, very strong"
"So, the channel mix is actually a great point of our strategy of multiple engines of growth and diversification and is one of the key element which is building momentum"
"So, yes, in our plans, there is a stabilization of the U.S"
business without BECCA and Too Faced and absolutely
That’s what we are aiming for and working for
"And the second question, we believe that we can open more distribution points than what will be closed"
"And so, this will be – is in our numbers"
There’s still a net improvement of consumer reach in our plans
"So, freestanding – go, go"
"In terms of innovation, we have one of the strongest innovation pipelines"
"As I said in my prepared remarks, the innovation in fiscal 2018 will be also very focused on reinforcing the existing very strong franchises which are in all brands – Too Faced, Peach or Better Than Sex, Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, Clinique taking the Fresh Pressed concept to the next level, et cetera, et cetera"
"So, there is a lot of buildup"
"You are now going to see one blockbuster which is a high-return, high-risk"
"You’re going to see every brand to have three, five, big serious initiative well-focused by category"
"And the portfolio of innovation of the company to cover all the opportunity by sub-category and region in a much more sophisticated way than we did in the past, thanks to better analytic and better preplanning"
"Frankly, this is very small"
"I mean, only one small fragrance brand is really in these impairment"
And then one very small brand that was part of the acquisition before
"And most of the other brands are growing double-digit, triple-digit, out of our [indiscernible] where we’re including the small brands where we have an impairment on"
They are all growing double-digit or triple-digit
"And in the case of the impairment, it actually is a timing issue"
"So, frankly, no"
We believe our acquisitions have been very successful and there is only one brand that has a small delay which in the context of the many acquisition that we have done is frankly not relevant
"We are very satisfied with acquisition and we believe that BECCA and Too Faced and the other acquisition we have done particularly in the fragrances, or GLAMGLOW for example, are extremely successful and will continue to be a big part of our growth"
