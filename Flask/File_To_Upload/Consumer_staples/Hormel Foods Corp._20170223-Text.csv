"Good morning, everyone"
"Earlier today, we announced record first quarter results of $0.44 per share, up 2% from last year"
Sales for the quarter were down 1% on a 2% decrease in volume
Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 5%
"For the quarter, three of our five segments reported earnings growth"
"Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products grew earnings, while Specialty Products earnings were flat"
Jennie-O Turkey Store had a difficult quarter versus last year with earnings down 25%
Sales were up 13% and volume was up 22% compared to last year
Segment profit margins declined from over 24% in the first quarter last year to 16% this year
"As a reminder, last year, we made dramatic shifts to product mix and cut operating expenses as we managed through avian influenza and a substantial decrease in volume through our system"
"As we communicated during our fourth quarter call, we knew the first half of the year faced difficult earnings comparisons"
"However, the erosion in market conditions was deeper and faster than we expected"
"Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store's profitability this quarter: declining turkey prices, increased expenses and increased competition"
"We can handle any one of these issues during a given quarter or year, but all three factors in the same quarter created a difficult operating environment that we did not expect"
"First, turkey prices such as breast meat have fallen over 60% year-over-year to seven year lows, which were much lower than we expected"
"Jim Sheehan will discuss our outlook for key commodities, but given the industry, now appears to be in an oversupply situation"
We do not see near-term relief on commodity prices which will pressure our pricing in the marketplace
"Second, we incurred higher operating expenses primarily for bio-security measures in our live production system and lower yields in our plant operations"
"We will continue to make investments throughout our business, including additional investments in bio-security to protect our business from an avian influenza outbreak"
"Third, as we have addressed in the past, competing proteins continue to pressure our business in addition to increased competitive pressure"
"We experienced this across all three sales divisions; foodservice, retail and deli"
The team at Jennie-O Turkey Store is taking the appropriate actions to address near-term operating conditions and challenges
We remain very optimistic about the demand for JENNIE-O branded products
We have improved similar turkey commodity cycles before and we always emerge in a stronger position
"We will continue to support the brand, deliver innovative new items and invest in the business"
Refrigerated Foods had another strong quarter
"First quarter operating profit increased 4%, with sales and volume down 3%"
"As previously announced, we completed the divestiture of the Farmer John business on January 3, 2017. Excluding the divesture, adjusted sales were down 1% while adjusted volume was flat"
Refrigerated Foods continues to benefit from growth in both retail and foodservice value-added products
"In foodservice, innovative items such as Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth"
"In our retail business, items such as Applegate bacon and breakfast sausage, Hormel Gatherings party trays, and Hormel Natural Choice meats delivered very nice growth"
International operating profits increased 5% while sales decreased 2%
Our fresh pork exports during the quarter were very strong
"We did experience a temporary slowdown in our branded export business due to changes in import regulations in certain countries, which have since been resolved"
Our SKIPPY business in China performed well while our meat business in China continues to experience high pork raw material prices
Specialty Foods operating profit was flat while sales declined 19% and volume declined 30%
"Excluding the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, adjusted sales were up 10% while adjusted volume was up 12%"
"CytoSport posted growth this quarter, driven by our success in the food, drug, mass, and convenience channels in addition to growth in CytoSport powders"
Innovative new items such as Muscle Milk bars and Muscle Milk yogurt smoothies continued to perform well
We saw strong sales growth once again in Grocery Products
Sales were up 7% with volume up 4%
Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 2%
"The addition of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, and SKIPPY all contributed to sales and volume growth"
"We completed the integration of the Justin's business during the quarter, and the business is on track to meet our valuation expectations"
Segment profit for Grocery Products was up 1%
"As we look to the remainder of 2017, the balanced model we have intentionally built in our business will allow us to overcome the challenges at Jennie-O Turkey Store"
We expect Refrigerated Foods results to be better than we projected for the remaining three quarters
"We see continued growth in many of our brands across both retail and foodservice, such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel BACON 1 fully-cooked bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats"
"Grocery Products will continue to build momentum, especially in the back half of the year"
"We continue to see sales growth aided by product lines such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Justin's specialty nut butters, and our Mexican Foods portfolio"
Specialty Foods is expected to perform slightly better than projected for the full year
The team has done an excellent job offsetting the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture
"And as a reminder, we will lap the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture in May"
International will perform as planned for the full year
"We anticipate strong sales for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, and CytoSport protein products in the International segment for the year"
"We expect the Jiaxing plant to begin producing products in the third quarter, enabling us to produce SPAM in China for the first time"
"We also expect relief in China pork prices in the second half of the fiscal year, which will improve the operating environment for our China meat business"
"We continue to see positive demand trends for JENNIE-O branded products, but market conditions are expected to cause full-year sales to be flat to last year"
"Percentage declines in earnings for the second quarter will likely be similar to the first quarter, while decreases in the back half of the fiscal year are expected to be in the mid-single digits"
"While it is early in the year, our assessment of the impact of turkey prices at seven-year lows creates challenges for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the total company's full-year outlook, despite expected growth in other segments"
"As such, we are adjusting our full-year guidance to $1.65 to $1.71 per share"
We are confident in the balance we have purposely built into our business and expect strong performance from our other segments to overcome the market headwinds at Jennie-O Turkey Store
"At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017."
"Morning, Farha"
"Farha, Jim Snee here"
"We do already purchase some meat on the outside, and we do have flexibility at times"
But our production cycle is a relatively long production cycle
So the flexibility doesn't really allow you to capitalize on all of that opportunity
"But certainly, our team is looking at that and watching those market dynamics and taking advantage of it as they can"
"Sure, Farha"
We're very active on the M&A front
"And like most quarters, we feel good about the pipeline we have"
"For us, the biggest issue continues to be getting it across the finish line"
That's always the most difficult part
"But as we think about what we are focused on, the need to become more global, businesses or items that afford us the opportunity to become more healthy, holistic, on-the-go, multicultural are all things that are squarely in our wheelhouse"
"And then we also, of course, are looking for those right opportunities that will add scale or support existing businesses with the idea that we want businesses that are margin accretive, that are one or two in the categories where they compete, and we want to make sure that we're bringing more than just a check that we really can add value to the business"
But I think the important thing to understand is that Fred and his team are very active
"The pipeline is full, and we'll continue to work hard in that area"
"So, Adam, as we put together our new guidance, on the JOTS side of the business, we do expect in Q2 to see similar decreases that we saw in the first quarter, and of course in half two, we're calling for mid-single digit declines for JOTS"
"We don't feel like we're being overly optimistic there, we are taking a realistic look at the business"
"We do expect stronger performance in Refrigerated Foods have very strong value-added sales, we expect that to continue"
"Specialty Foods group, the business and CytoSport which, of course, includes Muscle Milk, continues to perform well"
So we are expecting stronger performance throughout the year
"And then, Grocery Products have seen a lot of good sales momentum, we expect that to continue"
"International, same thing"
"So, we are expecting that those two business units will meet expectations"
"And then as we said, when we roll that all up, it's really – what we tout is our balanced business model that will offset some of those challenging market conditions for JOTS"
"Adam, we did – that your number is right and for us what it is the seasonality in the business"
"And we learned through the rollout – our innovative SKIPPY PB bites items, that once you get past Halloween, there are some seasonality, downturn in the confectionary business"
"So, it wasn't totally unexpected"
But we are on track for the $100 million and the $0.01 EPS accretion this year
So feel really good
"I think at its core, the volume for Justin's year-over-year was up 20%"
So the business is doing quite well
"Good morning, Jeremy"
I don't know if we've ever said that ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge
They obviously have a very strong position
Our position has been that we've seen growth in ground turkey because it continues to be on trend for consumers
And we expect over time that we are going to see growth in the share
We're going to see growth in the category
"Obviously, in any given quarter or any given year you run the risk of the supply cycle, and I think that's what's happened here"
"Obviously, from a pricing perspective, we've seen some discounts"
The one thing that I would point out is that our tray pack volume was still very strong for the quarter
The tray pack volume was up 15%
And so that tells us that the product is on trend with consumers
"But ground beef is certainly going to be a challenge for us as we continue, but we feel like we've got the right product connecting with the right consumers"
"As we looked at the rollup, Jeremy, we really feel like we've done a deep assessment of the business, and this is a realistic outlook for the business"
"We've got some good strong sales growth even in the first quarter in retail, foodservice, deli"
"But the fact is there is competition out there, and we understand that"
We understand the market dynamics
"And so we feel like this guidance is a very realistic look, not only at JOTS, but all of the business segments"
"That's a hard one, Jeremy"
"And we've talked about that a lot in terms of when we've been asked the question about what does it mean to you, one of the things we have responded with is tell us when"
"And so once we know when this is all going to happen, we'll be able to give you a better answer"
And I think labor certainly is one of the variables that comes into the mix
"From our perspective, clearly, we've got a great long-term workforce in many of our facilities, so we're well positioned"
And so we will be watching the timing of these plants coming online very closely and trying to better understand what that means
"Sure, Heather"
"From our perspective, as Jim Sheehan described earlier, we did see a spike in belly prices, and we took appropriate pricing action"
"It's going to take a little while to work through the system, but we feel really good about our ability to continue to take pricing in that category"
"We've also seen some competitive pricing action in that category as well, which bodes well, we believe, for our future, especially in bacon"
"In Refrigerated Foods also, let's not forget about our strong foodservice business"
"They had another great quarter in the first quarter, and there's no signs of that business slowing down"
So we feel really good about that
"And so the second quarter should be a good quarter for Refrigerated Foods, and that's what's leading us to say we do expect it to be a stronger performance for the full year"
"Heather, I would say it's pretty consistent across retail, foodservice, and deli"
"Good morning, Ken"
"First thing, obviously, is we're looking out the balance of the year driven by JOTS"
"As we get throughout the year, we'll be able to take a closer look at that, but it is early for us to be looking out into 2018 and 2019."
"Okay, thanks for the clarification, Ken"
I don't think that it structurally changes our business going forward
We're obviously in a market cycle
That cycle will correct
"And when we think about JOTS in particular, from our perspective, we know that there's history here"
History has been on our side
"We've seen this in 2003 and in the 2008, 2009 timeframe"
"In each case, we've emerged stronger"
We know that it's important for us to stay disciplined
"And JOTS, as you know, it's a key part of our balanced model and a key part of our business"
"So in terms of structural change, we don't see it, we just have to get through this cycle and we will"
"Sure, Akshay"
Jim Snee
"So the first part around competition and competitive pressure, I mean, we are seeing it in the markets, or in the meats, as you say, and we are also seeing it from competitors"
We're not the only company that was coming back out of AI looking to regain distribution and regain business
So there is an element of market pressure and competitive set pressure
So we are seeing that on both sides
"And then when we think about the next piece when you talk about expenses, Jim Sheehan referenced some of the bird performance on the live production side and we know that those are cycles and our team, again, coming out of AI is already working on addressing that in the live production side of the business"
So competition does have both parts
The expenses with bird performance
"The other thing that we mentioned, which is going to be a very good thing for us over the long-term is our venture into raised without antibiotics"
"And right now, obviously, we're making investments in that business"
We know that it's the right thing to do
"And that includes feed, supply chain densities"
There's a lot of things too that go into that
"And then the last thing, Akshay, and I want to make this part just clear on your opening comment"
We are not projecting $100 million decline year-on-year for Jennie-O Turkey Store
"We would expect it to be less than that, more – maybe half of that"
"Akshay, we saw that release earlier this week as well"
"Obviously, chicken has been in that space for a long time"
And so it's too early to tell
"We haven't seen the product, haven't really heard what the consumers think, haven't heard what retailers think"
So it's really too early to tell on that specific product line
But clearly we'll be watching it closely
"Thanks, Akshay"
Really we've got stronger performance for the balance of the year in both Refrigerated and Specialty Foods
"On the Refrigerated side, the big driver there is going to be continued strong value-added sales both on the retail side of the business and continued strong performance from our foodservice team"
"And then on the Specialty Foods side, like we said, the CytoSport business continues to do well gaining distribution, but also some great, new innovative items that are really starting to take hold in the marketplace"
"So between those two things, that's really what's going to offset some of the difficult market conditions for JOTS"
"Yes, Sean"
Jim Snee
That's a fair statement
"Really in terms of expenses, obviously, advertising was up on the quarter"
"There, as you would expect, were expenses associated with the Justin's integration that are one-time expenses"
So certainly advertising will play a benefit for the rest of the year
"We won't have the ongoing integration charges, but the bigger driver in all of this is really the sales momentum for Grocery Products"
And so SKIPPY continues to do really well
Our MegaMex portfolio of products is doing well
And then we do see some favorable market conditions that will help them out and then again the full year benefit of Justin's
So that's really what's driving our outlook for Grocery Products
"I think, Sean, we've talked a lot about the continued growth, the migration up the value ladder, if you will, in our Refrigerated Foods segment, and it occurs not just in packaged items"
"We're doing it across the entire Refrigerated Foods organization, in fresh pork, in meat products"
It's happening everywhere
"And so we'll continue to work on that, and we've been very successful"
"The other part to really consider is the, once again, strong growth of our foodservice business"
That's a business that continue to deliver quite well for our organization
We don't expect that to slow down
And then a lot of the innovation work that we are doing in on-the-go with our party trays and some of our other items that we've developed
"So is it a structural difference? It certainly is a structural shift, and we will continue to be working on that so that we do eliminate volatility over the long-term"
Sure
"Thanks, Rob"
"So to your first question, the answer is yes"
"We are committed to that long-term margin guidance, and clearly the impact of Jennie-O on just this one quarter moved us back a little bit"
But we do believe that this business is going to rebound and will emerge stronger and it's going to be a key part of that journey in the margin improvement
So the answer is yes
We are committed to that
"And to your second question, certainly there are elements of both, right? I think we are still probably gaining back some distribution, but you're gaining back distribution because there's consumer demand"
"And so again, the underlying fundamental there is we feel really good about the business, it's connecting with consumers and it's on trend, and we expect to continue to do that"
"Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay, thank you"
"Sure, Rupesh"
"Good morning, Jim Snee"
"Yeah, just following up on the earlier question around Justin's, the $13 million in the first quarter does account for some seasonality in the business in the whole confectionary space"
But we do want to point out that the volume is up 20% year over year
And so we do believe that we're on track for $100 million for the full year and still remain very positive about that acquisition and that business going forward
"And as you get to the Applegate business, our team there continues to work through the rebound of the supply situation, both on the pork side, and then that was compounded with turkey supply shortages through AI"
"And as you think of that business in specific parts of the store, the walled deli space is extremely competitive"
"The team's making progress there, but that's been a battle"
Really a lot of continued success in the meat case and the freezer
"Hot dogs, dinner sausage, the nuggets, the chicken breakfast sausage, those items are doing well"
And we're working now on developing business in the foodservice channel as well
So we think that that business is very healthy and going to continue to do well
Sure
"Eric, good morning, Jim Snee"
Thanks for those questions
I'll try to break those down here
So the first one around avocados – and you are correct
We have taken pricing increases on Wholly Guacamole
"And those prices have been in the marketplace a little while now, but consumer demand remains strong for the products"
"In terms of the avocado market, there are a couple of things"
"Prices are historically high, but they are down from some of their October peaks"
The other thing to understand is that there is adequate supply
"And so we have a number of – or a lot of the supply that comes out of Mexico, but we have other sources for supply as well"
So there's adequate supply in that space
And we again feel really good about the business going forward
"From a Grocery Products perspective, our guidance is consistent with what we laid out in the fourth quarter call"
"And so the business is very healthy, a lot of sales momentum"
"And you're right, once you get through some of these one-time expenses, we'll be able to deliver the guidance we laid out"
"And yeah, there is a mix shift (53:56), a mix shift as we think about the Justin's and SKIPPY and all of those product lines that really continue to build a nice broad base in the Grocery Products portfolio"
So we feel really good about what Grocery Products is doing and where they're headed
"Hi, Mario"
I think we're on track for the 5% organic growth number
"As you go around all of the different business segments, Refrigerated Foods, the strong value-added sales will continue to deliver there"
JOTS will be slightly lower
"We are going to see some volume growth, but obviously we understand the market conditions"
Specialty Foods will continue to perform well
"And then International, Grocery Products are all on track for what we said they were going to do"
"So we do believe, Mario, that we're going to be able to deliver that 5% organic number"
"I mean, I think, we've said our stronger performance will come from Refrigerated and Specialty, but there's some really nice sales momentum in Grocery Products, and we don't expect that to slow down"
"Thanks, Mario"
"Specialty Foods, you've got to remember that that's still a mix of CytoSport, HHL and our Specialty Products group"
"And so when we talk about that business, we are talking across all those different categories that are performing well"
"So I think we expect that business to continue to be strong, and even within that segment there's a bit of a balance that goes on at any given time"
We've seen some nice growth with CytoSport in some more traditional channels
"Remember, the C-store business, which is a big part of the CytoSport business, isn't measured"
And the team's done a great job not only gaining distribution but creating innovative new items to meet the needs of that channel
So it's all of those things that are really setting it up for a strong 2017.
"Heather, just a reminder, fresh pork exports are – they are a decent-sized part of the International business"
"They're not, I would say, a huge part of the overall company"
"And on any given year, obviously, we've had strength and then we've had some challenges with pricing pressure with products coming out of the European markets the last several years"
But it does look like the markets are setting up for a strong full year
"Certainly, you've got the China conditions, but I think we've also all read what's happened, or what is happening in South Korea, which is a strong export market for us"
So I mean we do feel like it'll continue to be strong throughout the year
"No, we're less than that, Heather"
Great
"Well, thank you all very much"
"While unfavorable market conditions in the turkey industry challenged our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, the balance we have intentionally built into all of our businesses allowed us to deliver earnings growth this quarter"
"Our team has a track record of delivering results, and we clearly understand what needs to be done this year to deliver the guidance range we provided"
"On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today"
