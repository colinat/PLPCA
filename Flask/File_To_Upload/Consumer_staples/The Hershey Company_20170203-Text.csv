Good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast
"And I apologize for my voice, as I'm fighting a head and chest cold"
"In 2016, we made progress against our strategic plans that strengthened our business model and positions the company for future growth"
"Our productivity and cost savings initiatives drove EBIT margin expansion in full year EPS growth of 7%, the midpoint of our long-term target"
"And we continue to generate solid operating cash flow, about $1 billion in 2016, which gives us a lot of financial flexibility"
"Looking at marketplace performance, our core U.S"
", CMG and snacks business progressed as we anticipated"
"Retail takeaway and market share performance in the second half of the year was better than the first half of the year, which was impacted by shorter Easter and merchandising and display strategies at select customers"
This resulted in full-year snacking market share growth of about 10 basis points
We also began a strategic review of our global cost structure that should result in solid margin expansion and EPS growth
We look forward to talking about our business in these plans in more details on the March 1 at our investor update
Let me now provide you with some detail on our fourth quarter results
"Net sales and marketplace performance, both retail takeaway and market share, were relatively in line with expectations"
"Operating income and earnings per share diluted exceeded our forecast, driven by the early implementation of some cost savings efficiencies and a lower-than-expected tax rate"
Patricia will provide you with more details on this in just a bit
"As we anticipated, U.S"
marketplace performance sequentially improved
Total Hershey U.S
"retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended December 31, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 2.2%"
"This represents all Hershey snack products sold at retail such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave and snack bars"
"Importantly, Hershey's U.S"
"CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway increased more than three times the rate of the category, driven by chocolate and was up 1.9%"
Our fourth quarter U.S
"chocolate performance was solid with retail takeaway up 2.9%, resulting in a chocolate market share gain of 0.9 points"
"Despite the slow start to 2016, we gained 0.4 points of chocolate market share for the full year"
Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed in July and October
"Reese's, our biggest brand, continued to gain momentum driven by variety, news, core two-cup advertising and in-store merchandising and display"
"The Reese's Pieces Cup innovation, NCAA football, in-store merchandising and strong Halloween and holiday performance generated retail takeaway of 7.2% this quarter"
"Results were similar to last quarter and impressive, given that this is nearly a $2 billion brand at retail"
"In 2017, we'll look to expand and improve upon our NCAA basketball and football relationship via innovation and targeted 360-degree activation programs given the customizable promotional entitlements available to us with this sponsorship"
We were also pleased with the Kit Kat franchise
"Fourth quarter and full year retail takeaway of 5.5% was about the same for both periods, driven by the success of the Big Kat new product launch, as well as the core Kit Kat instant consumable item that benefited from TV and digital marketing programs such as Chance the Rapper and Kit Kat thief"
"In 2017, we'll continue to bring variety and news to the brand with limited edition red velvet flavor for Valentine's Day"
"The wafer sticks are not red like the classic southern cake, but the candy itself is red velvet flavored and coated in white cream"
"In the first half of 2016, The Hershey mega brand campaign didn't work as hard for us as we anticipated"
"However, in the second half of the year, results improved driven by Olympics, S'mores and seasonal programming"
"In the fourth quarter, Hershey's franchise retail takeaway increased low single digits on a percentage basis versus last year"
"The launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch is underway, and we believe this will reenergize the brand"
"While early results are encouraging, distribution continues to build and advertising is scheduled to begin in early February"
"As we previously have mentioned, our consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across various snacking occasions is increasing, and this product fills a white space opportunity"
You'll see additional innovation in the marketplace this year that also delivers on a textural experience in Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup and Hershey's and Reese's Crunchers
"Our consumer research has indicated that millennials want new flavors and textures, especially the Reese's consumers"
"Reese's is the fastest growing largest instant consumable franchise, so we do a lot of work here trying to bring the right level of investment to the core two-cup and variety news to the brand"
"In 2017, we'll launch Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup in an instant consumable pack type"
"Within the cup are cookie bits versus a solid cookie, which consumers told us was less intrusive in terms of texture"
"The result is a product that delivers on all the sensations consumers want: smooth, creamy, sweet and crunchy"
"And the Crunchers product line is targeted for that shareable snacking hand-to-mouth occasion, leveraging the appeal of sweet and texturally complex snacking"
"These light, crispy and crunchy combinations are a perfect bite-sized snack for a different and unique eating experience"
"So, we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do"
We're not satisfied with our non-chocolate candy
"In Brookside performance, the work is underway to improve their trends"
"Although it will be a multi-step process, we continue to believe that candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long-term, when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing"
"Now for an update on our international markets, where fourth quarter net sales growth was relatively in line with our expectations and up about 3% on a constant currency basis versus last year"
"I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where we generated solid constant currency net sales growth"
"In Brazil, our growth was fueled by distribution gains in core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark bars, which was launched in Q3. As a result, in Q4, market share increased 0.5 points"
"And in our Mexican business, chocolates, spicy sugar, confectionery and drinks are tracking relatively in line with our initial plans"
"Our marketplace performance improved in the fourth quarter, with chocolate retail takeaway up about 9.5%"
"And our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we're gaining chocolate momentum driven by Kisses"
"Net sales in India, driven by the brands we're investing behind, Hershey's branded syrup, spreads and milk booster, as well as JOLLY RANCHER and Sofit, increased about 25%"
"Late in the fourth quarter, we launched Brookside, primarily in the modern trade where we don't expect much of an impact from demonetization"
"While small, this launch gives us exposure to a value-added segment with above average margins for the India business"
"In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories"
"In Q4, China chocolate category sales declined about 4%, the same rate as the second and third quarter declines"
"Our Q4 net sales in China declined about 11% on constant currency basis, slightly lower than our estimate"
"Sell-in related to Chinese New Year drove Q4 net sales, and advertising and in-store programming occurred just as we had planned"
"Our e-commerce business continues to progress, and our market share here is estimated to be greater than our share in brick and mortar"
"Now, I'd like to pause briefly here to just say thank you"
It's been an honor to lead The Hershey Company and these quarterly conference calls as Chairman and CEO
I'm so proud of our company and what we've accomplished
"I've always appreciated the questions and feedback we've received on these conference calls, and in all of the various meetings that we've participated in with you"
"I've shared many of your thought-provoking questions and insights with my team, and I feel it's made me a better leader and Hershey a better company, so I say thank you"
"And now, I'm proud to turn the call over to Michele Buck"
"As we announced in December, Michele will become Hershey's 12th CEO on March 1, and I'm pleased to be staying on as Chairman"
"I know that many of you have met Michele and know her, and agree that she's an experienced executive with excellent operating, marketing and strategic capabilities"
"Now, let me turn the balance of the call over to Michele"
"Thank you, Andrew"
Yeah
"I mean, we give the volume breakout in North America Josh"
"So, if you were to look at North America, the volume and subtracted the takeaway, I mean, it's not perfect math, but it would get you to how we thought about it in the fourth quarter in December"
Right in line with what we thought
"So, as we've talked, the first quarter should really drive a lot of the growth"
"I think if you look at the sales, first half, second half will be quasi similar, although the first half will be driven by the first quarter"
"We had a lot of, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings in the second half of 2016. So, again, if you were to think of EPS growth probably more first half, first quarter driven"
"Hey, David, I'll give you a macro comment and then Michele can follow up if she wants"
I was at FMI last week
"And one of the things that seemed to be pretty broad based across a number of retailers, and as I was hearing comments across manufacturers is that people were optimistic in terms of their plans, and I felt as though people were looking to really invest in their business from a merchandising standpoint and promotion"
I'm really speaking about retailers as they were talking to us as well as others
"And so, I felt really good that people really wanted to go out and execute against good plans"
"It didn't feel quite as conservative, I would say, as it did the previous year"
"So, I just took that as a fairly optimistic tone that people see their destiny as in their hands, and they're going to go execute against their business"
"And I don't know, Michele, if you want to add to that?"
"Well, Rob, we'll talk to a lot of this on March 1, especially some more detail around what some of these IT investments are at the business level, to ensure people are working most efficiently as possible, as well as at the corporate level"
"So, I think you're going to see a little bit of both"
"I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves on March 1 here, but there's a lot of things in the market changing very faster than they ever have before, and we're trying to bring solutions to retailers and be where the customer is going"
"So, I think you'll see more of this on March 1."
