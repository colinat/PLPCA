"Thanks, Rob"
"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings"
"This is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team"
"Hopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning"
"I'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A"
"There will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties"
Actual results could differ materially from these statements
Please review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials
So let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter
We had a really strong quarter
"On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion"
We delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share
"So we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them"
We recently completed a debt tender offer
We made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter
We made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets
"So excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business"
"comp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%"
We saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes
Our Walmart U.S
eCommerce sales grew 50%
Sam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes
International delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales
"Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us"
"We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S"
comp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares
Just a couple of reminders
"We'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website"
So please mark your calendars for that
"And at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions"
Question-and-Answer Session
"Thanks, Michael"
"Let me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S"
"So on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points"
"And you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S"
hurricane-related expenses that we had
"I'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts"
So just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter
For Walmart U.S
"specifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter"
"Price investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well"
"And the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that"
"So I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price"
"We're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders"
It's really the productivity beginning to turn for us
"So you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses"
"So if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online"
"The fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time"
"Thanks, Oliver"
So the first question around smart cart technology
It's something that we continue to look at
We need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart
"com, but nothing really more to add at this time"
"In terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience"
Think about it as a flagship store
This is expected to launch in the spring
It will be dedicated store on Walmart
"We're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site"
"So we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring"
"Well, I think there's a lot of things"
"If you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S"
"business, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint"
"So, we continue to look at it"
"I think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us"
We continue to make progress on inventory
"You've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business"
"I think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon"
"Well, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up"
"Jet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work"
So there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results
Really the way we think about eCommerce is really in total
Jet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall
We made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S
"eCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole"
"In terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business"
I think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go
"But in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see"
Thank you
Maybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail
So we'll take the inflation piece first
"So the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very – it's – you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter"
The fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets
"As we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward"
"In terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up"
We know that that's working for our customers
We continue to expand it
"We're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year"
So that's a big initiative for us
It's working and our customers love it
"In terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things"
"It's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well"
"Kary, anything else you want to add?"
We won't give the specifics of that
It's working for us based on our rollout plans
"Thanks, Robby"
And I appreciate it
So I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business
"One of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs"
We need to be more efficient
We talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that
We have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have
So that's what we continue to do
I think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business
"We have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception"
But I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing
"Rob, next question please?"
"Well, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped"
But it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall
I know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward
"There's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall"
It's great that we started to see that in the third quarter
We've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that
"But it's not one thing, it's a lot"
"Thanks, Karen"
"Rob, next question please?"
Thanks for your question
"So, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now"
"The details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest"
"So pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line"
"So we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding"
"Well, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S"
population in general
"We're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers"
So we continue to push that forward
"In terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information"
"But we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways"
"We're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year"
"We'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that"
"We do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck"
"So there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer"
"The real – I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well"
"We haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now"
That's really a different product mix and more than anything
"In terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing"
It's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have
"But not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers"
So we continue to watch that and learn from it
And nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have
Maybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul
"In terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S"
"business, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit"
Sam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points
"We talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S"
business and about $20 million for Sam's
So I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint
"In terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic"
So a 3.6% member traffic growth
We have members coming in more frequently
We have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs
And that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter
"Matt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance"
"There was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter"
"I mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side"
"See from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall"
"And one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up"
"So if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual"
I think the key is to be flexible
"If you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense"
"You have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms"
"And then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties"
"So I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options"
"I think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel"
"But, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share"
It's hard to dissect on who from
So I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you
"But thanks for your question, Kate"
Thanks for the question
I think it's TBD
"I think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward"
We have a lot of initiatives underway
"A lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about"
"So I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too"
"We certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time"
So we continue to do that
"Our brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that"
"Bigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot"
It's over 70 million
"In the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million"
So we continue to make progress
Thank you
"Thanks for your question, Joe"
"And we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is – it's a great brand that now is associated with us"
"So, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data"
We analyze the data really well
We know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website
We think it helps the brand overall
So we'll watch brands like that
We're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn
I think pricing is a piece of it
"But I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there"
"Thanks, guys"
We don't have any more questions in the queue
"So I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays"
