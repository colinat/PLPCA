"Thanks Bob, good morning everyone"
As Bob mentioned we had a very strong second quarter
We achieved organic revenue and bookings growth at every segment
Leverage on this organic growth combined with solid contributions from our recent acquisitions and strong execution on margin improvement activities resulted in an overall segment margin of 15%
"Sequentially, this represents a 320 basis point improvement over the adjusted first quarter"
"There were several highlights in the quarter, including broad-based growth in engineered systems, the return of organic growth in fluids, and meaningful progress in the retail fueling integration, productivity and commercial improvements in refrigeration and food equipment, and lastly strong growth in energy on a higher than expected US rig count and increased well completions"
"Also from a geographic perspective, US, Europe and China markets all grew organically year over year"
"As noted earlier, we are increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance as a result of our strong second quarter and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year"
"I'll share those specifics with you in a little bit, but first let's go through some of the details on the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation deck"
"Today we reported second quarter revenue of 2 billion, an increase of 18%"
Strong organic growth of 10% was complemented by acquisition growth of 12%
Partially offsetting these results was a 4% impact from dispositions and FX
"EPS was a $1.04d, exceeding the high end of our expectations, principally reflecting strong conversion on higher revenue"
"Segment margin was 15%, 190 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by strong incremental margin on increased volume in our energy segment and by stronger performance in refrigeration and food equipment"
Bookings increased 19% to 2 billion
"This positive result reflecting organic growth in each segment is comprised of 12% organic growth and 11% acquisition growth, partially offset by a 4% impact of dispositions and FX"
"Book to bill finished at 1.01. Overall, our backlog increased 21% to 1.3 billion"
"On an organic basis, backlog increased 16%"
"Free cash flow was 150 million in the second quarter, a sequential increase of 115 million"
We expect very strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year consistent with our normal pattern
Now turning to Slide 4. Our strong organic growth was broad-based
Engineered systems grew 5% driven by solid activity across both platforms
"Fluids organic revenue increased 4%, principally driven by solid retail fueling and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets"
Refrigeration of food equipment increased 5% reflecting alignment with retail refrigeration customers who are investing
"Lastly, energy grew 39% organically"
"As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 34% in fluids and 10% in engineered systems"
"Turning to Slide 5. Engineers systems revenue of 655 million, was up 5% organically reflecting broad-based growth"
Earnings increased 3% as volume leverage was moderated by investments and material cost inflation
"Our printing and identification platform revenue increased 5% organically, driven by continued strength in our marking and coding markets"
"In the industrial platform, revenue increased 15% including acquisition growth of 17% and 5% organic growth"
The organic growth was broad based with particular strength in our waste handling business
"Margin was in line with our expectations, which included a 90 basis point impact from acquisitions"
"Bookings increased 14% overall, including organic bookings growth of 9%"
Organic growth reflects solid markets across the segment
"Book to bill for print and identification was 1.01, industrials was 0.97. Overall book to bill was 0.99. Now moving on to Slide 6. Fluids revenue increased 36% to 553 million reflecting our acquisitions and retail fueling and 4% organic growth"
"Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by solid activity in retail fueling, especially in Europe and Asia and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets"
"Earnings increased 36%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains"
"Of note, we have accelerated the pace of our retail fueling integration and now expect a 6 million net benefit for the year, up 3 million from our prior forecast"
This will put us ahead of the pace for 2018 synergy benefits
"Margin in the quarter was 13.3%, up 330 basis points sequentially representing meaningful progress in our retail fueling activities, including integration and commercial actions"
"Bookings grew 34%, driven by acquisitions in organic growth of 4%"
Organic bookings growth was driven by solid activity in our pumps and our hygienic and pharma markets
Book to bill was 1.0. Now Turning to Slide 7. Refrigeration and food equipments revenue of 426 million included organic growth of 5%
The organic increase was largely driven by strong activity in our retail refrigeration business
We outperformed the border market on the strength of our alignment with customers who are investing in energy efficient solutions and enhanced fresh and prepared food merchandising
"Food equipment results were in line with our expectations, with solid results in our can-shaping business more than offset softness in our commercial cooking equipment markets"
"Earnings increased 4% from the prior year or 8% on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact from a prior-year disposition"
"Margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially, reflecting improved execution and volume leverage offset in part by previously mentioned material cost inflation"
Bookings increased 6% organically
Book to bill was solid at 1.09. Now on Slide 8. Energy revenue of 359 million increased 39% year-over-year and 11% sequentially
"Earnings were 53 million and segment margin was 14.9%, both significantly improved over last year"
"These results exceeded our prior forecasts largely driven by US rig count growth, increased well completion activity and strong results in bearings and compression"
"Bookings were up 43% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, setting us up for a solid third quarter"
"With respect to the third quarter, we expect revenue will be up about 1% to 2% sequentially"
Book to bill finished at 0.98. Now going to the overview on Slide 9. Our second quarter corporate and interest expense were both essentially in line with expectations
Our second quarter tax rate was slightly higher than forecast at 28.9% and included 2.5 million of discrete tax costs
"Excluding these costs, our effective tax rate was 27.8%"
Now moving on to Slide 10. We now expect total revenue to increase 12% to 14% versus our prior forecast of 11% to 13%
"This forecast includes organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%, up 1 point"
"The impact from completed acquisitions, dispositions and FX is essentially unchanged"
"From a segment perspective, organic growth of engineered systems and fluid are both being raised 1 point, driven by solid second quarter and broad-based bookings growth"
Refrigeration and food equipment remains unchanged from our prior forecast
"Energy is now expected to grow 24% to 27% organically, up 4 points over the last forecast, largely driven by strong second quarter growth and continuing constructive markets"
"Our full-year forecast for corporate expense is up 5 million, primarily on increased investments"
We expect third and fourth quarter tax rate to be about 28%
Further our forecast for CapEx and free cash flow is unchanged
"Lastly, we now expect full-year adjusted segment margin to be up slightly from our prior forecast"
"As a result, we now expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $4.23 and $4.33, up $0.15 from our prior forecast at the midpoint or an increase of 38% over 2016 on an adjusted basis"
The revised guidance reflects increased second half performance and in all segments
Please note that our guidance bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck
With that I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments
I would start first by telling you that our first quarter was probably a bit stronger than we anticipated
Our second quarter was a bit stronger than we anticipated
Our bookings were strong during the quarter
June bookings were solid
I think we feel fairly comfortable and confident with our third quarter forecast
"And I will tell you that sitting here today, I feel like we're being a bit conservative with our fourth quarter forecast"
This was the only segment where we did not raise organic growth for the balance of the year
"And Jeff, my color comment on that was the activity within this segment wanted to see a raise in organic growth in refrigeration and I would just tell you, I think we're being a bit conservative with our outlook for the fourth quarter and did not raise organic growth"
"But the activity sort of, today sort of warrants that, but I think we're being conservative"
So let me take that question
You do point out quite correctly that in the quarter we had very strong organic and total growth as well at 18%
"So, working capital did increase, net about 50 million in the quarter with AR being about 100 million up"
"So, given the sequence within the quarter, with June being the largest part of the quarter's results, gives me some confidence that as we go into the back half that receivables will be collected"
Now let me comment on inventory because I think this is an important point
We did see our inventory; we said this in the first quarter
"We continued to carry into the second quarter with inventory increase of about 50 million more than we would have expected principally driven by a few areas, one being as we referred to before to better manage our peak periods of production flow in refrigeration, we increased some inventory there"
That will burn off in the second half
"We also selectively increased inventory as we started to see some material cost inflation in very specific areas, not broad based, but very specific areas"
So all in all about 50 million of inventory builds over above where we would have expected that I have full confidence will burn off in the second half
"Well, longer than that"
"Andrew, we feel quite comfortable with our cash flow forecast for the balance of the year"
"But specific to margin, off of the second quarter rate, we do expect to expand that margin in the back half on energy"
Yes
No
I think they're up a little bit more than that
I think our expectations now are up about somewhere around 80 bps
