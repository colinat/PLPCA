"Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone"
"We closed 2016 on a positive note delivering outperformance from both core sales and earnings growth perspectives as our outstanding team of 24,000 employees around the world, leverage the power of the Fortive Business System"
"2016 was a remarkable year as we not only launched Fortive, but seamlessly serve our customers accelerating product innovation maintained or expanded leading market positions in all of our businesses and lift our values by holding over 700 Kaizens including the CEO Kaizen we highlighted last quarter"
"And our first two quarters as a standalone company, Fortive delivered over 3% core revenue growth, expanded core adjusted operating margin 90 basis points and gross margin 60 basis points"
Delivered free cash flow conversion of 129% and grew adjusted earnings 12% all while continuing to invest in both growth and productivity initiatives and M&A that will allow Fortive to deliver long-term value to our shareholders
Living our values helping our customers accelerate progress and leveraging the power of the Fortive Business System positions us well for 2017 and beyond
"Turning to the fourth quarter of 2016 for a more detailed discussion of our results, let me first remind you that the following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the supplemental financial data posted to our website"
Adjusted net earnings of $237.7 million were up 3.6% over the prior year
"Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68. If not for the $0.04 of additional investments we guided last quarter, adjusted net earnings per share would have grown 9%"
Currency was an additional $0.01 headwind to adjusted EPS
Sales grew 3.3% to $1.6 billion or a core revenue increase of 3.5% reflecting growth in five out of our six platforms
"Acquisitions contributed approximately 90 basis points of growth during the fourth quarter, which was more than offset by approximately 110 basis points of unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S"
dollar
"Geographically for the second quarter in a row, North America and Western Europe drove low single-digit revenue growth in developed markets"
High growth markets accelerated to high single-digit growth in the quarter driven primarily by China and improved results in Latin America partially offset by challenging Middle East markets
"North American growth of low single-digits was driven primarily by strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Matco, Fluke and Kollmorgen"
Western Europe growth of high single-digits continues to reflect outperformance to the general macro environment as market share gains were realized across both professional instrumentation and industrial technology segments
"As we guided last quarter, we use the outperformance in third quarter of 2016 to invest opportunistically back in our businesses in the form of both long-term growth and productivity investments"
"Even with those additional investments, we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter demonstrating the value of FBS and focused execution"
Gross margin was 49% reflecting 90 basis points of expansion over the prior year
Operating profit margin was 20.8% which reflects core adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 basis points
"During the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 124%"
"For the full year, free cash flow conversion was 115%"
"Turning to our segments, Professional Instrumentation posted core revenue growth of 1.2% and acceleration of almost 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2016, reflecting continued stabilization in North American industrial markets"
"FX was a significant headwind in the quarter of approximately 130 basis points, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 40 basis points"
Professional Instrumentation operating profit margin was 23.1% reflecting a core operating margin decline of 30 basis points driven primarily by long-term growth investments undertaken in the quarter partially offset by decreased amortization
"Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single-digits primarily led by good performance of both Fluke and Qualitrol, which comprised our field solutions platform"
Field solutions core revenue was up low single-digits in the quarter with Fluke and Qualitrol posting low single-digit and high single-digit growth respectively
The growth at Fluke reflected solid demand for handheld industrial products in North America as well as Western Europe
Sell-through data continues to improve in both regions
The integration of eMaint Enterprises continues to go well and we’ve seen positive customer reaction as we launch combined offerings to provide our Fluke Condition Monitoring Solution
"eMaint held a customer conference in November, where customers have the ability to preview the new integrated solutions to improve productivity of labor resources, increase equipment up time and increase asset life via shifted predictive maintenance"
"We were overwhelmed by the number of customers eager to be early adopters, and while it’s still early days on the commercialization front, the sales funnel expanded approximately 30% in January versus December"
We’ll continue to keep you updated on this important growth driver for both Fluke and Fortive
The Fluke team continues to innovate and expand the Fluke connected tool box as evidenced by the recent release of the Ti480 Infrared Camera
The Ti480 introduces 640 by 480 resolution into a ruggedized pistol grip form factor to maintenance professionals across a variety of vertical markets
We’ve seen incredible traction with this camera during it’s first six weeks on the market and are excited about it’s growth prospects going forward
Qualitrol’s high-single digit growth marks it’s eleventh consecutive quarter of positive core growth
Demand continues to be driven by utility customers in high growth markets particularly the Middle East and APAC regions where we continue to gain share with OEMs. The Qualitrol team has made important progress executing their condition based monitoring strategy
And leveraging it’s broad offering to customers clearly FBS has played a critical role in improving funnel visibility and marketing identification
"Moving to product realization the platform, core revenues were down low-single digits this quarter reflecting project timing of PacSci EMC and Invetech"
"For the year, these two businesses grew at low-single digit rates"
Given the nature of these project based businesses it’s not unexpected to see variation in growth quarter to quarter
We do have good line of sight into the backlog at PacSci EMC and Invetech and we expect continued low single digit growth trajectory forward
Tektronix reported low-single digit core revenue growth during the quarter reflecting continued outperformance in China of high-double digits and stabilization in developed markets
China growth remains to be driven by the conductor semiconductor and communications segments where we continue to gain market share with our industry leading technology
In North America we’re seeing signs of stabilization
But no signs of recovery in the computer and semiconductor segment
"The military, government and educational sectors continue to perform well here and we see tremendous traction with our 70 gigahertz real time Oscilloscope particularly within data centers"
Our Sensing Technologies platform posted high-single digit core growth in the quarter
The controls end markets continue to be challenged partially offsetting strong outperformance in our sensor businesses where we saw new key account wins globally and increased demand for our MRO products in North America
"Moving to our industrial technology segment, we realized core revenue growth of 5.6% in quarter"
"Acquisitions contributed approximately 130 basis points of growth relative to prior year, which was partially offset by a 100 basis points of unfavorable currency translation"
"Reported operating profit margin, increased to 20.7% and core operating margin was up 80 basis points for the quarter reflecting margin expansion across all platforms"
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high-single digit growth in the quarter with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering high-single digit core revenue growth
"During the fourth quarter, we experienced a headwind from the EMV related indoor point-of-sale solutions that was more than offset by an increase in outdoor EMV related demand for both dispensers and payment kits"
The November 2016 announcement regarding the outdoor liability shift in the U.S
"to 2020 did not have an impact on our fourth quarter results as most customers had already ordered before year end, consistent with their capital spend budgets"
Looking forward we don’t expect the delay to affect the total incremental outdoor EMV opportunity that we previously outlined
And we continue to believe that this is a three to four year opportunity
"Net, net we view the 2020 timeline as a positive as it reduces our customer’s near term liability and also because we expect the incremental outdoor EMV impact will be more evenly distributed over the next several years"
Telematics realized core growth of low-single digits in the quarter with most of the growth stemming from outside the U.S
Director our new SaaS platform continues to gain traction and we’re encouraged by our record high installed base in the United States
"We’re further encouraged by the recent ELD or Electronic Logging Device decision that clears the way for ELD adoption by the transportation industry beginning in 2017. Automation and specialty components posted mid-single digit, core revenue growth in the quarter"
Automation growth was offset by core revenue decline in Jacobs Vehicle Systems which was impacted by the challenged North American heavy truck market
Within automation Kollmorgen and Thomson both grew core revenues high-single digits
"Thomson’s growth was driven by distribution, medical equipment, and off-highway vertical markets"
This is Kollmorgen’s third consecutive quarter of growth and was reflective of outperformance in both developed and high growth markets driven primarily by targeted efforts in the medical robotics and metal-forming verticals
"Kollmorgen’s use the speed design review help them execute their robotic strategy to address secular growth in collaborative robotics and they grew revenue strong double digits in China in 2016, as a result of their FBS commercial growth tools"
These are just a couple of examples of how our businesses leverage FBS to drive growth and outperform their markets
"Moving to franchise distribution, which posted low-single digit growth for the quarter, I’m happy to share that once again Matco grew revenue at a high-single digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same store sales and franchise apps"
"Matco Expo, Matco’s largest franchise event of the year is in the first quarter of 2017 and we are anticipating record attendance of almost 10% over the prior year"
Matco’s mid-single digit or better core revenue growth track record is now 26 out of the last 28 quarters
"To wrap up, we have a strong finish in the fourth quarter contributing to a solid start for Fortive"
As I had alluded to before the reinvigoration of our culture was evident as the Fortive Business System drove both core top line and earnings out performance while allowing for investment in the future
"Our excellent cash flow performance combined with our strong balance sheet leaves us well positioned for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market leading positions in 2017. We are initiating our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes assumptions for low-single digit core revenue growth, amidst stable end markets"
"Combined with the benefits of our additional restructuring and growth investments this past quarter, as well as decreased amortization we anticipate core margin expansion in excess of 50 basis points with an effective tax rate of 28% for the year"
"In 2017, we expect currency to be approximate headwind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points to the top line and $0.05 to EPS"
"As you can see from the waterfall in the slides, we expect productivity and restructuring benefits to provide a $0.04 to $0.05 tailwind and low-single digit core revenue growth at a 30% to 35% fall through to contribute $0.04 to $0.13. Our resulting 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.60 to $2.70 implies growth of 7% at the high-end of the guidance"
"We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.54 to $0.58, which also includes an assumption of low-single digit core revenue growth"
"In closing I want to say how proud I am of our 24,000 employees for all that we’ve accomplished in this milestone year"
I’m looking forward to Fortive’s first full year as a standalone company
"Fortive’s culture of FBS and accountability will serve our customers and you, our shareholder as well as we live our values and work every day to deliver essential technology for the people who accelerate progress"
We’re committed to making 2017 another great year
"With that, I’d like to turn it over to Lisa"
Thanks Steve
"I think first of all, M&A continues to be our main priority so no change in that"
"We think today, we have about $3 billion worth of capacity over the next couple of years"
And so we’ve got plenty of opportunity
"As we mentioned on prior calls really a number of things have been happening in relative to building our own capacity, couple deals that we’ve got done in the third quarter as we mentioned on the prior call"
Nothing this quarter but certainly we’re very busy and I think we are very fortunate to be in a position we are at right now from a balance sheet perspective
I’m highly confident we will get some things done in 2017 with a breadth of deals both from a size perspective and across the platforms
"Yes, I wouldn’t say pricing has been an issue at all I think at the end of the day, we’ve been very much – we’ve been active and I think we haven’t seen much change in pricing over the last 12 months"
"Yes, mostly I think the other $0.02 on growth was mostly in PI I think, Steve as it translated we were able to accelerate a number of things around condition monitoring, some things we want to do on the new platform to tack as well as a couple of incremental investments in other parts of the portfolio"
So that just gives you a sense of both the restructuring and the growth
"Okay, we will take that in a short answer but certainly as we talk to a number of customers we’ve been out"
"I think there is not a real change at this point with anyone’s out look at this point, lot moving around and most customers are really started waiting to really understand if there’s difference from a policy perspective that are actually going to be enacted"
So I would say its still very early days we note at the stabilization in the North American market from really the third to the fourth being pretty consistent so no real uptick and nor is there one plant in our guide
"Thank you, Steve"
"The R&D, the 6.1 we’ve been right around there, up or down 10 basis points and now you expect this to be there, when you click down by opco there’s going to be some changes this projects ebb and flow but no real changes to our R&D from – we want to change the investment level"
So its just the normal place
"The big thing that’s going on in terms of SG&A is the growth investments we put in, in the second half of the year as we saw the top line strengthening we kicked off a little bit more investment and we really called out some of that in the third quarter when we overachieved in the third quarter so we’re going to even put a little bit more to try and accelerate and help us out next year"
"Scott, we think of it in a couple of ways first the guide doesn’t assume any M&A"
And so whether you are getting into high single-digits without the benefit of deploying using our balance sheet is what we’ve been really consistently saying and we feel pretty good about that
"Having said that, as Jim said we expect to deploy some M&A and that’s the thing I think is going to take our – that I expect to take our earnings growth up over the next year or two"
Thanks Scott
"Yes, we can"
"Nigel, maybe just a little bit of color, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, regionally we expect sort of the U.S"
"and kind of the developed markets to be – what I would say relatively stable in that kind of low single-digit range, will probably get a little bit uptick in the high growth markets above that, maybe mid single-digits and the high growth markets for the year"
So that’s kind of our thought here
We don’t anticipate any big shift in any of the markets
"Relative to operating company, certainly we’re seeing a little bit better growth in places like Fluke that we expect, in automation, Kollmorgen’s three quarters in a row, track record is pretty good – is obviously very good, we’re very pleased with that"
And then some of the perennial folks like Matco and Gilbarco will continue to do well
"But I think it’s a very balanced approach to growth I think as we think about it, both regionally as well as within – as Chuck mentioned in the segments and certainly as you drill down in the operating companies, pretty balanced as well"
"Still a little noisy at Tektronix, particularly in the developed markets, they’re doing an outstanding job in their high growth markets, particularly in China as we noted on the prepared remarks, but we still think Tek is going to be a little noisy in the first half"
Thanks Nigel
Good afternoon
Thanks Julian
"Hi, Jeff"
So the fourth quarter performance was really more of a story of just them blocking and tackling well
The high-growth market is doing very well
"China, India, number of those markets doing well"
"So there really was not as much an innovation story, that’s really to come"
"I think we highlighted that they have a new platform coming out in the second half of the year, which we’re really excited about"
We think it will deliver some increased revenue for sure
"And we just passed a major milestone on that platform here a couple of weeks ago, so it gives us even more confidence that launch is going to be on time in the second half and that will start a series of new products over the next several years"
"So it’s not just sort of one big launch in the second half, but really office platform that will keep a level of innovation in the marketplace that we’re excited about"
So the tech team is doing – I think we’ll see a little bit choppy first half
I think they will probably be okay in the first quarter because they’re little bit easier comp in the first quarter as well
But I think as we get to the second half we’ll see improved performance
Unidentified Analyst In a similar vein in terms of kind of growth initiatives maybe update us a little bit on the Fluke Connect
"You mentioned it in your opening script, but how that is progressing maybe the size of the business at this point if you would like to share with any other color around that"
"When we launched the condition – we have the Fluke Connect tools out for a few years and then just as we mentioned on the new infrared camera, this is the launch of another connected tool which is great"
So that level of innovation we’ve continued into the marketplace
The condition monitoring solution that will certainly highlight at the Investor Conference as well
"We’ll give you a sense of that, but that really got launched in the fourth quarter"
"Early days as I mentioned that combined with the eMate suite, software suite that will be an integrated solution here shortly"
And we’re seeing a lot of dual selling that’s able to happen with the team relative to the getting sales leads and building funnel
"But it’s still fairly early days, not a lot of revenue yet"
I think one thing the sales cycles a little bit longer
This is a SaaS-based solution
So it takes a little bit longer to get the customer to think through that
"So I think we’re probably not going to see meaningful revenue to the second half, as we work through the lead gen, work through the funnel and then obviously you need to build momentum with SaaS-based business before it starts to bring the cash register"
"So we – it’s really probably a second half even in the 2018 kind of story, but we’ll – we’re very –it’s still early days I said in the prepared remarks, but I think we’re in a very good place relative to the solution and the way customers are really understanding and getting to understand the solutions"
"Unidentified Analyst Great, thank you"
"Maybe just a final note on that – we’ve got about that the target market on that is about 600,000 manufacturing sites around the world where they really, really don’t have a solution today and can really easily install the solution for a low, with a very low interest costs and ability to upsell them with new features over time"
"So it takes a little while to get out of those places and get the lead generation engine going, but we’re – we’ve started and I’m very – I’ve got great optimism here"
"Unidentified Analyst Great, thank you"
"Hi, Rick"
"And maybe this is a final point, even though we did have a little bit more price at Gilbarco on the quarter, we had excellent gross margin in performance in the quarter"
"So one of the things we look at the combination of pricing gross margin is probably part of your question Rick, is to make sure that even if we’re giving up a little price, sometimes we’re giving price on maybe higher software or something that inevitably brings higher gross margins in the portfolio anyway"
"And in this case even with that price, we are able to as you pointed out to deliver excellent gross margins"
I think at this point it still price in FBS
"I mean that we really do as you know, we drive businesses really hard on a regular basis around continuous improvement on gross margins"
Price is an FBS tool and we utilize it in every business every year
So those are just kind of standard work in our businesses
If our SaaS and software today its 4%
Those businesses were up about –up double digit
"I think if we look at all those collective offerings in the quarter, but it’s still a small part of the business"
"It’s really going to take a little while for that, that to really be a meaningful impact"
"And that part of our confidence whenever we get the question about our ability to drive gross margins over time, it’s not only the power of FBS, but it’s also the business mix that we can see over the next four or five years that coming at us"
It should accelerate
I think the market’s growing
I think as we pointed out last couple of quarters that our non-U.S
business has been exceptionally good
"We added in the fourth quarter double-digit units into the portfolio, but because of a variety of different things that we needed to do relative to some customers they didn’t necessarily, it doesn’t necessarily transition in the quarter right, because it SaaS takes a number of quarters to play out"
So we think that this certainly can be the markets growing in the U.S
mid to high-single digits and in some segments even higher than that
So we really believe
We’ve launched this new director platform as we mentioned in the prepared remarks and we’re excited about it
We need to get it more pervasively through our installed base
And we think once that’s more in with more customers are opportunity to change the trajectory that growth rate is pretty good as we move throughout 2017.
Thanks
Hi Shannon
"Yes, I think our instincts, right, as we said we really wouldn’t know what the rollout would be"
I think our instincts would tell us right now
I know it’s not as much customer conversations as it is instinct haven’t been in the industry for 20 years
Our instincts tell us will be a little bit of a pause here for customers as they think about the rollout strategy
That will be months and quarters not years
So but – and that’s why we think we come off a little bit of that 100 basis points maybe a little bit less than 100 basis points
"But those are the upside of that is – as they probably a better curve in terms of rollout, and as you mentioned we think probably less kits and more dispensers"
"So probably, as we get to mid-year, we’ll have a better sense of that, where we remodel it every month, but I think our model will be more accurate"
"And at that point, we’ll have a better sense for the market opportunity"
But I think we always knew that there was probably going to be some level of push out and this really is probably mostly good news for us relative to how the next several years are look
One is that some expansion in resources around sales force around the world
The business just is doing great globally
That’s number one
"And in a couple of acquisitions, we did several years ago that gave us that can some of the products from a condition monitoring perspective that are driving some growth as well"
"So there – the team is done and that’s the growth flywheel that we talk about metaphorically, so often about how acquisitions even small ones could accelerate growth in mid-size businesses and we think that that opportunity exists in a number of places in the portfolio"
Thank you
"Yes, I think the core growth as we’re talking about a slow single digit, but we do have an easier compare in Q1. So it’s probably going to the higher end of that range in Q1. And then I think that the EPS split as it goes through the year, we’re still learning as we go here, but it’s going to be something like 22, 26 – 26, 28 if I get the numbers"
That probably didn’t adequately
But it’s in those range…
"Yes, they had a strong quarter, again the team is really executing well"
"They’re continuing expand franchises, which really drives growth"
We really kind of make sure that same-store sales are good
"I suspect there was a little bit annoyed and if we went month to month, but as we really roll up the quarter, it was still very good"
"So I think at this point, what we’re seeing right now with a combination of just wonderful attendance rate at our expo here in a couple of weeks as well as a good start"
I think we’re still going to be in that mid to high single-digit range for a while now
They’re doing a great job
"As we’ve said and I know this is, FBS is really just one of our – from a growth perspective, is one of our best businesses for deploying FBS and our – in from a growth perspective"
So they’ll continue to do that
And I think will continue to perform well
"Nothing yet, I think we’ve been number of things that we’re doing actively have been going on for a little while"
"I don’t necessarily get a sense that anyone’s holding up for doing anything, because of waiting for Washington to do anything"
"And obviously, our discussions are global as well"
"So between the various things that go on both from a macroeconomic perspective in a geopolitical situation, you’ve got a number of elections in Europe as well, which provide some uncertainty and usually uncertainty is a good thing, so for M&A"
So I think all those things roll up to I think a pretty good environment right now
And as I mentioned before the bit out they haven’t changed radically
So I – that’s what gives me confidence say I know we’ll do some deals here in 2017.
"Thanks, have a great evening"
"Yes, sure"
"I think, one we don’t have a lot of CapEx businesses in China"
So we’re really fortunate to have things that are more related operating expense kinds of things
"We’re certainly getting the benefit of the secular trend in Tektronix, where they really well positioned themselves over the years to take advantage of a lot of the semiconductor and communication expansion that’s going there and they’re doing exceptionally well"
So that’s in our – certainly in our number and really have to do with – it really isn’t a macro point
I think we go around the rest of the portfolio though we’re continuing to see strength with a number of our OEMs that our automation team has partnerships with in our cultural business has and our food business is done pretty well as well
So we had – we just had an exceptional fourth quarter
I don’t necessarily think that the strength that we’ve seen is necessarily what happened all of 2017. But we still feel very bullish on what China look like next year and think it’ll outpace our overall growth rate next year
"Not really, not really – it’s still early right, you could never call China until about March, because of the new year in particularly the way the new year was position this year"
So it is the – having run China for a long time
I generally try not to make any predictions and so well into March
That’s mostly a North America and a little bit of China comment
Their positions are pretty niche
So it really is market share gains for them and business with that size a few big market share wins really makes a big difference
"Hey, Andy"
You’re exactly right
Thanks for calling out my inability to forecast the geography
"But clearly I think what we saw, some really good performance with some work that we’ve been doing like at Kollmorgen on collaborative robots where they have a number of strong customers in Europe"
And the number of businesses as well that are really more secular driven than any macro
"And that continued in the quarter, but we don’t think that that will continue"
You mentioned some of the geopolitical risk I think we – Chuck and I would say that that does exist
"We’re monitoring it to understand it and we do think that Western Europe will moderate through the balance – through 2017. But we still think it will grow, we still think its probably at least a low single digit grower right now and it might be a little bit more noisy month to month and maybe even quarter to quarter because of what we just described on the election cycle"
"But I still think given our positions and what we’ve been doing from an execution perspective, we feel good that we can get growth out of Europe this year"
"I think its certainly still early, their story for performances they have done a great job of mitigating much of the North American challenge – with a great challenge with a great business in China"
But we’re – its still a little early days on North America and if that’s going to tick up or not
"Well, certainly the certifications and those kinds of things are certainly something that was from an early perspective is really one of the reasons why we have such great growth last couple of years in North America"
At the end of the day there’s really it’s sort of mostly a two horse race here and with good competitor there in Wayne
So I think at the end of the day how that will play out over the next several years is how we predicted
So we were never counting on that certifications being our competitive advantage
"Our real competitive advantage is being number one, and dispensers being number one in payments and having the largest retail POS system for retail petroleum in the industry"
So you combine that with our lead detection capability at Veeder-Root that ultimately is our completive weapon it’s the technology we have at the site that we think is how we compete in
It’s a logical competition amongst smart minded players if you will
So we – that’s one of the reason why we like the market so much
Well as we think about M&A relative to both field solutions and product realization or where Fluke and tech are
"We certainly feel very strongly that additions to the set of solutions that we want to add at Fluke in manufacturing, in facilities where we take advantage of our huge installed base as Fluke are going to really like eMaint like we did last quarter are going to be the transactions or something bigger that would give us the ability to leverage our position around the world"
Those are great deals and I think we’ve said over time that our funnel for field solutions is been good for a while
"Relative to tech and product realization, there was certainly a large transaction – we know the company well, we used to be in that industry but we got out of it"
"So we really were interested in it, we felt strongly that that exposure to the telecommunications players and things like that over time was probably less where we were going"
"So I think from that perspective it’s probably safe to say that while we were in that business a number of years ago and so we know a number of the players in the industry, its where we’re going with Tektronix is really around service and adding capabilities there to reduce volatility, to improve the margin structure, built on the great brand that we have attacked"
Those are going to be the kind of deals that we would typically play that would be in our suite spot
But nothing in industries where we’d likely see more volatility and where we’d see consolidation amongst customers
All right
"Thanks, Patrick"
Have a great night
"Hey, Joe"
"So Joe, what we’ve got begin is – what we normally have been looking for we think we have opportunities for 30 to 50 basis points of price"
"I think your question, on the cost side about what we expect from commodities and inflation and we’re not really seeing a lot of inflation and if this plan"
So when we see it will react to it
And we also have one of the great things about our portfolio’s we’re not exposed to a lot of commodities
"So as this mean we’re perhaps zero, but fairly little"
So we haven’t seen much of that upward pressure but even when there is we don’t think it’s going to be a big driver that we won’t be able to offset
"Joe, I just wanted to add to that"
That includes growth to – so when we think about it what Chuck and I view on our quarterly basis as we mean with every month we meet with our operating leaders to go through the financial
And if we think we have opportunity both either on the cost side or on the growth side will typically make decisions for incremental investments as we see the quarter play out
"All right, thanks, Joe"
"No, good question, but no, no our guide have been 100% or 105% free cash flow to net income does not assume any significant change in that"
Going forward over time I can see that percentage working up with when we – as we do more M&A and get that benefit amortization you’ll see it come off of 100% to 105% to something higher
"Thanks, Brian"
"Well, there’s a lot of scenarios out there and we’re watching them all"
"But net, net from the best way, the way we’re working on it that we were a net exporter here"
And so every scenario that I have seen this is going to be favorable to us
We do have things that we import externally but we export more
So every – so far in every scenario that I think we’re going to turn out to have a lower tax rates as if and when they pass the law and in act
"All right, thanks, Charley"
