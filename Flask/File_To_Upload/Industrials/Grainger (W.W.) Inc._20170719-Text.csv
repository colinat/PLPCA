"Thanks, Laura"
"So this quarter was about staying focused on creating value for customers, while executing our pricing initiatives in the U.S"
and improving the economics of the portfolio
"Before I go into detail on these activities, I’ll discuss overall company results"
"We’ll start with our reported results on page – on Slide 4, which were significantly impacted by restructuring"
"We began winding down the Columbia business in the quarter, which resulted in restructuring charges of $42 million"
This business has struggled with sustaining profitability and we are moving quickly to ensure we have businesses with competitive advantage and strong returns in the portfolio
"In the quarter, we also took steps to transform our Canadian business"
"We announced the closure of 59 branches and eliminated poorly performing assets, resulting in $20 million in restructuring for the quarter"
I’ll discuss Canada in more detail in a few minutes
"This morning’s call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude items outlined on page two of our press release"
"So turning to our adjusted results, our adjusted results were in line with expectations"
Total company sales were up 2%
"Volume for the company was up a healthy 7%, as many end market strengthened and our pricing actions started to take hold"
Price was down 3% as expected and consistent with the first quarter
Gross profit declined 110 basis points in line with expectations that we had discussed in April
And we continue to get operating expense leverage on higher volume as operating expense as a percentage of cost was 50 basis points better than last year
Let me start with our other businesses
"For our other businesses, which include our online model and our international businesses, sales were up a 11%"
That included a 3% headwind from currency largely due to the British pound
"The online businesses, which include Zoro in the U.S"
and MonotaRO in Japan continued to deliver strong sales growth of 23% and expanded operating margins 50 basis points in the quarter
"The other businesses operating margin decline was largely driven by lower than expected performance in the UK, due to economic conditions and the devaluation of the pound related to Brexit"
"We also completed the supply chain initiatives in Cromwell, which enable us to improve service and the cost structure of that business going forward"
But those changes impacted H1 results in Cromwell
"Mexico, Fabory and China make up the bulk of the rest of the international portfolio and all of those showed nice growth during the quarter"
"In Canada, we saw sales declined 3%, but sales were up 2% in local currency"
We see trends improving in Canada and we continue to manage expenses resulting in improved performance and a smaller loss than last year
"As I previously mentioned, we are closing 59 of 144 branches in Canada"
"To be clear, we are in the midst of a substantial transformation in the business"
This business has scale and should be quite profitable
We’re still on track to exit 2017 in a break-even run rate
We will discuss our longer-term aspirations for the business as we move through the balance of the year
", the U.S"
business performance in the quarter was heavily influenced by our pricing actions
"Sales were up 1 for 7, 1%, which is driven by – which was a result of strong volume growth of 5% and price deflation of 4%"
"For those of you who look at the EPG documents, you’ll notice that for large customers, our volume went down slightly, that was all driven by government performance, which slowed in June and affected our results"
The slowdown was really driven by government spending delayed in local and state budgets and in federal civilian funding
"Other than that, we saw continued good trends in terms of volume"
Operating expenses in the U.S
"were up 2%, again demonstrating leverage and volume growth of 5%"
"Operating margin declined 160 basis points, driven by the gross profit impact of our pricing actions"
"Other operating metrics around service, competitive position continue to be strong in the U.S"
"team is focused on executing the price changes and selling the value that we provide to customers through our onsite services, advantage fulfillments and focus on saving customers time and money"
So I want to take a little closer look at the volume response to our pricing actions in the quarter
I would point out a few things
"First, we are seeing positive signs, where we want to see positive signs, most notably reversing trends with midsize customer volume and large customer spot buy volume"
This is critical to moving from an unfavorable customer mix to a favorable mix over time
"Second, we are hearing very positive comments or more customer groups about the changes we are making"
"Customers recognize that we still have a premium price, with that we will be more competitive"
That makes sense to customers given the value that we provide
"Finally, these results are up, small volumes in some cases, but our margin of volumes give us a lot of confidence in the path we’re on"
We continue to get more comfortable with the fact that these changes are working
Our midsized customer volume continue to excel – accelerate throughout the quarter
"Now about 50% of our midsized customer volume is on a more competitive pricing, and the midsized customer volume was positive for the quarter for the first time in more than five years"
"With larger customers, we see more volume coming through without discounts"
"These prices are lower than before the changes, but this volume is important to support the profitability of the business going forward"
"We are continuing to renegotiate our large customer contracts and we are ready to go for August 1. The vast majority of the contracts will be renegotiated by August 1, and the remainder will fall in normal renewal cycles"
"As a reminder, the actions on August 1 result in all prices for all customers being more competitive"
"This will speed up customer retention efforts, accelerate the acquisition of new customers as we accelerate marketing spend and simplify our pricing to make it much easier for customers to understand"
These actions are critical to achieving our 2019 operating margin objectives
Turning to expenses as a key component to achieving our 2019 goals is expense management
"As a reminder, in the second quarter, we announced that we would take out $100 million to $125 million of costs by 2019, $80 million to $95 million of that net of marking – marketing investment will come out of the U.S"
business and in corporate
We’ve already identified approximately 75% [ph] of the actions and much of that work is underway
We will share more information as we announce actions internally
"In Canada, we announced $20 million to $30 million of cost takeout largely driven by the closure of the 59 branches that I mentioned earlier"
Taking a closer look at the U.S
"from 2017 to 2019, we’re assuming annual volume growth of 6% to 8%, resulting in incremental volume variable expense of approximately $60 million to $90 million"
"We’re expecting inflationary expenses of approximately $80 million to $90 million – $80 million to $85 million, which is about 2% of the base annually, and that’s going to be partially offset by cost takeout of $80 million to $95 million net of the marketing investment"
These actions result in significant operating expense leverage as we continue to focus on improving the customer experience and driving productivity and profitable growth
"Given what we’ve seen so far with the pricing actions and the impact in gross profit, these expense reductions result in operating earnings aligned with the 2019 objectives we discussed last November and in April"
Turning to guidance
We’re reiterating our 2017 adjusted guidance issued in April
Q2 performance was as expected and we anticipate continued positive response to our pricing actions in the second-half of the year
"Looking at our 2019 targets, our long-term operating margin guidance remains unchanged from our November 2016 Analyst Meeting"
", we’re confident in our ability to gain share profitably"
We provide exceptional service to our customers
"With our pricing actions and marketing activities, we will gain share at a faster pace"
"And we will continue to take cost out of the business, while improving the customer experience"
"In Canada, we’re on track to exit 2017 at a break-even run rate"
"Our long-term guidance for Canada 2% to 4% is not good enough, we know that"
We’re working towards returning to double-digit operating margin on a faster path
"In other businesses, we continue to be encouraged by the growth and profit improvement of our online businesses and our international portfolio"
"So before we take questions, in closing, we performed as expected in the quarter"
"We’re seeing growth from the pricing actions in the places that will help us grow profitably in the future, most notably midsized customers and large customers spot buy"
We’re focused on simplifying our portfolio and making sure we have profitable growth as evidenced by the wind-down of our Colombian business
Our actions in Canada are intended to speed the path of double-digit profitability for the business and we will provide frequent updates for you along the way
"And we continue to believe that we’re well positioned to improve the customer experience with more relevant pricing, superior service and an unmatched digital experience"
"Today, we also announced that Ron is retiring at the end of the year"
He will stick around to close out the financials for 2017 and we have started to search for his replacement
I want to thank Ron for his many contributions to Grainger in the past 20 years
We greatly appreciate all that he has done for Grainger
So now we’ll open it up for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
"It’s a great question, thanks"
"Let me just start by saying that, we think the market has grown this year and we have seen strengthening in many segments"
And so part of the growth is certainly – part of the volume growth is certainly driven by strengthening in the market – of the marketplace
"When we look at the pricing actions, we see growth that is significantly higher than we see in the past in areas that are directly affected by pricing and that’s what gets us comfortable, particularly midsized customers, where we were double-digit negative last year and that were positive"
"Large local customers that are not on contracts, which have turned positive and have been negative for a long time, and then just the spot buy with manufacturing commercial customers, which have turned positive as well"
And so we see very strong growth in those areas and that gives us confidence that what we’re doing is working
And we – we’ve estimated the market to be growing a couple of percent this year with volume of 5% in the U.S
"Certainly, we feel like we’re gaining volume share and most of that is probably reaction to our pricing at this point"
No
That – it’s really all government
"In fact, government’s 100% of the slowdown"
We saw state and local government holding funds
We saw federal government holding funds in many cases
"There are rumors that that is easing up, but we’ll have to wait and see if that plays out, so it has been all government during the quarter"
"I guess, the short answer to that, Ryan, is not really"
"I mean, I think the industry is seeing pressure on margins across the Board the last few years"
And certainly product and price transparency has increased as more customers Google items actually with two customers yesterday we were talking about our price changes
"And their response was that’s fantastic, because we don’t feel like we should be negotiating every item with you"
"And if you’re in the ballpark, you’re going to get the business, given the service that you provide"
"And so really we’re seeing very strong response at very strong margins, where we’re getting the new price programs in place"
So there hasn’t been a real change in the competitive environment necessarily on those items where we’re competitive
So let me handle pricing first and then I’ll go and turn it over to Ron to handle gross profit
"So we would expect July to be similar to what we’ve seen thus far this year, because there’s no change in July"
"For the rest of the year, we would expect to be price down – price to be down roughly 6, so we would expect kind of 5 to 6 in the quarter"
"And you asked GP as well, Ryan, is that right?"
"Yes, so there will – so there will be some revenue impact obviously in the closed branches"
"Typically, we see revenue impact in the 20% roughly range, many of these branches"
"So to give you a sense, in the U.S"
we have 250 branches
"In Canada, we have 144 and the volumes attempt"
"So we’re over store in Canada right now until we are closing branches that are unprofitable, there’ll be some revenue impact, but it’s going to be positive OE impact"
"And we’ve taken a very closer look at where we want branches to be and where there’s foot traffic, where we can use those branches offer service to customers that they will stay open"
"And we will continue to provide actually better service to customers as products ships directly to customers, and we still provide services to customers twice the business"
So some revenue lost certainly
"We are really focused on getting the business reset to a place where it can grow profitably, that’s our focus right now"
"Bob, we are having trouble"
"We are having trouble here, sorry"
"You’re just breaking up, I’m not sure"
"But okay, let’s try, try again, I’m sorry"
Yes
"And so I think the question is, how do you take competitive response to the model"
"I would say, we’re in an industry in the U.S"
"where the markets roughly $125 billion and competitors compete in very, very different ways"
"I was at a customer in Milwaukee yesterday and we were there, a lot of our competitors were there, serving different volume in different ways"
And we have not seen direct response to the changes yet
"It’s not obvious, given that some compete specialists, some compete online, some don’t compete online, it’s not obvious that how competitors will respond"
And we feel like we get within range of the prices that we’re going to be very strong in terms of our growth
"For the mom and pops, it’s not obvious that there’s a lot of room to respond really in terms of profit margins as well"
So we’ll watch that closely
"We’re watching it closely, and we will see what happens, but we haven’t seen much response yet"
"So I can tell you, we’re looking at the competitive environment very closely"
We’re not setting our web prices to be near the bottom on the stat
"One thing I would say is, we actually spent a little bit of marketing money in the quarter on customer acquisition"
At those put for items that we already changed on web prices and we had a very good response on small volume
And so I think we’ve shown and proved to ourselves that we can acquire customers at a price that is not low
"It’s competitive, but it’s not low"
"And so, we don’t feel like we’re going to have to – we know we’re not going to have to be lowest price and we feel like we’re positioning the price virtually"
Good morning
"Yes, it was in line with our expectations"
So keep in mind that large customers most of their prices had always been competitive
And so the price change will have less of an impact initially with large customers and then well at midsized
"And so we would expect shift in midsized to be much bigger than our – with larger customers, and so it was right at our expectations for the quarter"
"Yes, so the back-half of the quarter the government was down and everything else, the trend stayed stable effectively is the way to think about"
"I think that’s your question is, we saw a significant year-over-year down with government as state, local, and federal in some cases health funding"
But everything else just kind of continued on similar trends
"Government started the quarter very strongly and ended very, very slowly"
"And these are all – just keep in mind these are all very large contracts that we have with the government, so it’s completely independent of our pricing action and really what they chose to spend or not spend"
Yes
"So we have a lot of examples of doing this very well, particularly the online model with MonotaRO and Zoro"
So lot of this is marketing spend online with a paid search of product listing ads
The dynamic we’ve had on the U.S
"for a long time is that, if we had a customer click through as we paid – used paid search advertising, they would click through a price that was or they see a price the visible price that was much higher than the competition"
"So the difference now is when they click through, they’ll see something that is reasonable, and that marketing will have a much higher return than it had historically"
We haven’t had great returns in the U.S
", but particularly on new customer acquisition with marketing where we have with MonotaRO, for example"
"And so as we think about this, we’re going to spend marketing spend to acquire customers and then to acquire contacts within existing customers and the return on that should be much better than we see in the past because of our pricing"
"Yes, it make more sense to spend more, the return is much better"
"Yes, in the back-half of the year, we’re expecting 6% to 8% of volume growth"
And so fairly strong volume growth based on the price changes and some marketing ads
"I think the government is probably a wildcard still in terms of what happens we – we’ve heard rumors of things easing up, but we will need to see it"
So we’ll see what happens with the government
We are not talking about much at this point
"Yes, we are very focused on actually in the price – the pricing changes effectively on improving our cost structure"
We will provide 2018 guidance at the Analyst Day in November
"Well, when your prices are – your visible prices are much higher than the competition, and you do things like digital marketing, you don’t get the returns that you get"
So this will enable us to spend on marketing dollars from midsized customer for customer acquisition like we have been able to do before
"I would also say that when you sit down and talk with our customers, customers like as recently as yesterday, they are very excited if we are reasonably priced to give us a whole bunch of more volume"
And so we’re pretty excited about – they’re pretty excited about the prospect and not having to come to us for negotiations for SKU level decisions
And so we feel like that’s going to change the game pretty substantially
"Thus far, we’ve only changed partial prices"
And so what you’ve seen so far is a partial response to the pricing changes and that will change start again in August
"So percent of SKUs online spend 400 some thousand, so it’s been 25% to 35% have been repriced or repriced at the beginning of the year and that that will be all of them soon"
"And at the percentage of volume, I think that the most important thing to recognize, it was large customer volume, large customer pricing was already competitive"
So the impact has been fairly small thus far on large customers
We renegotiated a bunch of contracts in the last 60 days that will change that dynamic
But so far large customer prices really haven’t been all that different this year than they’ve been in the past in many cases
"Yes, Deane, that’s a great question"
I guess I go back to the strength of our cash flow generation through cycles is very strong
"As you know, we reinvested about a third of our cash back in the business and the other two-thirds given back to shareholders"
"So, that’s not a real concern of ours at all"
We buy through the cycles
We’ll continue to buy back shares as we’ve given a guidance in the past
We’ll continue on that same path
"I don’t think in this case, it had much impact on spot purchases in the aggregate"
So we have a very clear view to the pipeline and many of our government customers
"And so the pipeline looks pretty good, but the money didn’t release at the end of the second quarter and that was – you can tie into very specific state and local governments and very specific federal agencies, it just did not release any money"
"So in this case, it’s pretty easy to see what’s going on, and assuming that you release the money, it will come back, but it’s very easy to see what’s going on from a pipeline perspective"
It would have been a little bit of a hindrance for that
"Sure, yes, absolutely"
Yes
"What should happen is in 2019, our price should stabilize and so that volume growth in 2019 actually is positive for GP dollars"
"And then this – when you put this the expense picture below it, you get to the earnings guidance we’ve had before"
And I just wanted to make a comment earlier about the sequential GP rate
"There’s nothing unusual in the quarter GP rate, but sequentially to the first quarter, there is an anomaly in the first quarter"
"And I’ll just go back to the press release from that, because it’s there year-over-year and it’s how our national sales meeting is accounted for and there are some costs that are moved between expenses and GP"
"So that does create a sequential difference from the first quarter to the second, and – but it’s just accounting-related, it’s not operational"
"So, Hamzah, I won’t talk about a specific percentage of them, actually that’s appropriate to talk about publicly"
But – so let me tell you about the customer conversations we had
"Yesterday, I was talking with a customer, and their perspective was, they get things the product availability, a wide range of products it comes quickly"
"But their perspective was also that, we provide them with a whole lot of support around safety service around inventory management services"
We’ve embedded ourselves to help and manage our inventory
We understand how the business runs
I talked to somebody who places the orders
We talked about six people in the organization
"And his view was, your orders are the easiest to place, easiest to get resolved, because you understand how our business operates and you link with our process very, very well"
"So there’s a whole range of the way we operate, which will allow us to command a premium in the market as long as that premium isn’t, so visible and so large"
So we have – we’re mostly outside sellers calling on large complex customers
"We have an inside sales team calling on midsized customers, but most of the numbers are in outside sales"
We – there’s a couple of things going on
"One is, we think pricing will allow those dollars to grow revenue, have better conversations and more conversations without having to talk about price as much and we feel like the revenue per sellers should increase"
We should get more penetration at those account
So we look at revenue per seller pretty closely
"Our expectation is we will get significant improvements based on the pricing actions, based on the tools we’re providing sellers, based on the number of factors and we are confident we’ll start to get more productivity out of the sales organization"
Thank you
"Yes, thank you"
"I think based on the quarter, that would be a reasonable assumption"
"I would say that the quarter was as expected, given the changes going on in the business, given what’s going to happen in August 1. We’re very confident in the past, but there’s no reason to alter our guidance at this point"
"We feel like, we’re on the right path"
"Yes, so we are – our COGS this year are likely going to be on the 0.5%, and we are not seeing huge inflationary pressure moving through, there is a little bit, but not much"
"If in fact, we got inflation, we would be able to get price in the number of places and number of customers"
"It works that way to see whether that happens, but we’re not – we have not seen any inflation in our COGS at this point"
"Well, I think we have worked very hard putting processes to manage COGS"
"We work – we’ve put in new processes to really understand the competitive environment, understand what products should cost and build that into our work with suppliers"
I think we’ve done a nice job of managing it
No government business did impacted and we saw for large customers spot buy x government was pretty stable throughout quarter
We actually hope the trends up
"I think when we’re talking to customers now about the new pricing structure, both us and they would like to get out of the situation where we have to negotiate every item"
"And so our hope is as we grow midsized customers as we grow long-contract customers, as we get the new contracts in with contract customers that actually spot buy will grow and we feel like we can make that happen"
It’s down
It’s a little bit more significantly third and fourth quarter over the prior years than it is in the first-half
"So it’s worsening, but we haven’t given guidance on that per se"
We’ve kind of stayed with the whole year
"I think our total year guidance is still good, just a little – obviously a little bit worse in the second-half than the first-half on a year-over-year comp"
A product mix continues to be favorable for us
"And what I mean by that is we’re – it’s not offsetting GP rate, but it’s at least mitigating some of it"
And that’s the growth we’re seeing with the medium-sized customers in particular and the product they’re buying that even though their price reduced they’re still at margins above the company average
And so that does provide a partial mix offset
"Well, it’s not a permanently rebased margin"
A lot of that has to do with the currency and the currency shifts having an impact on GP rate
And so we are working through pricing changes as a result of that
"But when that happens typically, we like that and so we have to make that up"
We’re also working on the plans to get back to where we need to be starting in 2018. So it’s not a permanent change
It’s just a pretty significant change given the currency translation
So thanks for joining us this morning
"Just to reiterate, we performed as we expected during the quarter"
"I think, the exciting points are that we’re starting to see growth in places that are really important for a long-term profitability, most notably midsized customers and large customers stop buy"
"We are continuing to make the portfolio stronger, making sure that the businesses we have are profitable and have profitable growth"
"Our actions in Canada, we are taking an eye towards improving profitability much faster there and took some significant actions in the quarter"
We’ll keep talking about what we’re doing there
And we really believe that we are very well positioned to improve the customer experience
The conversations we have with customers around pricing have been fantastic
There has been no walking by customers
They’re very happy with what the direction we’re taking
They understand that we have a great service
They understand that we have a strong digital experience
They understand that we have a strong onsite experience
We’re going to continue to leverage those things to grow the business and we’re really excited about the path we’re on
"So with that, thanks for joining us and take care"
