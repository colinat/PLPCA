"Thank you, Mike"
Please go to slide number 5. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points I'd like you to take away from today's call
"As Mike discussed, we've started 2017 on a strong note, with continued strong bookings growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share growth, and free cash flow in line with our expectations"
"Our results are on track at this stage in the year, with continued strong bookings growth, and we're therefore adjusting our full-year earnings per share guidance up $0.05 at the bottom end of the range, as Mike discussed earlier"
We have a detailed breakout of our guidance for your review in a few slides
"Our bookings and revenue performance were both strong, with growth in both segments"
"Commercial and residential HVAC led the way, both with high single-digit growth in bookings and revenues"
Adjusted operating margins also expanded in both businesses
"We were pleased with our industrial business performance, which is demonstrating steady adjusted operating margin improvement"
"We continued to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings, and took additional cost reduction actions to improve operating results going forward"
"We also drove strong organic bookings growth in the quarter on both equipment and services, which was encouraging"
"Earlier in the year we identified our dynamic capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions, and approximately another $415 million on dividends"
"Year to date, we can report we've spent $417 million on share buybacks and $103 million in dividends"
We also made one modest-sized acquisition
We are continuing to follow the capital deployment plan we announced in January
Please go to slide 6. Our focus on execution of our strategy and operational excellence drove solid year-over-year performance
"Net revenues were up 4% organically, and adjusted operating margins improved 20 basis points"
"Strength in revenue performance was driven by our Climate segment, while operating margin improvement was broad-based across our Climate and our Industrial segments"
"Please go to slide 7. Organic orders were strong in the first quarter, up 7% with strong results in both our HVAC and industrial businesses"
Climate booking strength was broad-based with growth across the globe and up 6% overall
"Organic commercial HVAC bookings were up low teens in equipment, with strong results from both unitary and applied products"
"Residential bookings again showed strong growth, up high single digits, and continued share gain"
"We also drove good growth in parts, service, and controls, which is helping us to build a more sustainable business by increasing our income from recurring income streams"
"Transport organic bookings were down low single digits, primarily driven by the expected decline in North America refrigerated trailers"
Our diversification strategy enabled us to partially offset the decline in trailers through growth in truck and international bookings in the quarter
"The Industrial businesses bookings were up 9% organically in the quarter, led by strength in compression technologies and small electric vehicles"
"In compression technologies, we saw solid growth in both the long-lead engineered-to-order business, which were coming off a weak first quarter of 2016, as well as in our small to midsize shorter-cycle products"
"In electric vehicles, we are seeing good growth in our new consumer vehicle, Onward"
"Please go to slide number 8. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up high single digits in North America and Asia, and up mid-single digits in Latin America"
Climate organic revenues were down marginally in Europe and down high single digits in the Middle East off a small base
"In our Industrial segment, overall organic performance was up slightly"
"Modest declines in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa were offset by improvements in Latin America and Asia"
"Overall North America revenues were up mid-single digits, and international revenues were up low single digits, netting a positive 4% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise"
"Please go to slide number 9. Q1 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume and productivity, partially offset by material and other inflation"
We continued to make significant investments in business innovation and operational excellence to further improve our competitive positioning
"Please go to slide number 10. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 6% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 10.6%"
"Strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential HVAC was partially offset by transport revenues, which were down mid-single digits in the quarter, primarily due to softening North America trailer and auxiliary power unit markets, partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia"
"Climate adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points year over year, driven by strong execution across the Climate businesses"
"The impact of higher volumes, productivity, and price far exceeded headwinds from material inflation, ongoing business investments, and other inflation"
"Please go to slide number 11. Our commercial focus on aftermarket, operational excellence initiatives, and cost-cutting measures continued to drive operating margin improvement in Industrial in the first quarter"
Industrial adjusted margins increased 60 basis points on slightly higher organic revenues
"Aftermarket growth was solid, more than offsetting modest declines in compressor equipment"
Adjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization was higher by 100 basis points
"Please go to slide number 12. Free cash flow was negative in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and normal seasonality"
Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range we provided in January
"Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong and gives us optionality as our markets continue to evolve"
"Please go to slide number 13. Our expected 2017 cash flow continues to enable us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns"
"In our 2017 guidance, we highlighted our capital allocation priorities"
The first was investing in our business as our number one priority
These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs
"As I moved through the earlier slides I discussed investment in the business multiple times, as it's at the heart of our innovation, growth, and margin expansion story"
The secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet
"We're BBB rated today, and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company"
The third area is our commitment to paying a competitive dividend
We've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time
"In fact, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 20% over the last five years"
"The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases, and not necessarily in that order"
"In 2017 we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these two areas, and year-to-date we've spent $417 million on share repurchases and a modest incremental amount on a key strategic acquisition in the Climate space"
"We intend to spend the balance of the $1.5 billion during the remainder of 2017. We will continue to create long term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy, as we have consistently done for years"
"Please go to slide 15. As discussed earlier, while it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05. We have largely maintained the other elements for our guidance for the year, so the next few charts will be similar compared to the ones we covered in January"
"The main thing I'd like to point out on slide number 15 is that our operating margin guidance targets have gone up somewhat, to reflect the new pension accounting treatment that moves a portion of the cost from the operating line to the other income and expense line below operating income"
"Net adjusted margins rise by about 10 basis points for each segment, and 20 basis points across the enterprise"
We've provided current and restated numbers in our news release tables that outline the impact of the change in more detail
The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening U.S
dollar outlook
"We continue to expect Climate revenue to be up approximately 4% organically, and for Industrial revenue to be down approximately 1% organically, which is consistent with our prior guidance"
"Please go to slide number 16. We've raised the low end of our continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50, excluding about $0.15 of restructuring"
We had a large planned restructuring charge of $0.10 in the first quarter related to the consolidation of three plants to further optimize our footprint
"We have a number of actions we forecast taking for the balance of the year, but we think approximately $0.15 for the year is still our best estimate at this time"
"Please go to slide number 17. There are two FASB accounting changes we adopted January 1, 2017, and want to make you aware of them"
"First, we were required to adapt accounting standard update 2016-09 in the first quarter"
"The primary change is to recognize in the P&L any tax windfall or shortfall from stock option exercises and stock vesting, where previous recognition was deferred to the balance sheet"
"Our planned adoption of the new accounting standard was built into the 2017 guidance we provided in January, and increases the effective tax rate volatility versus the prior accounting"
"In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a non-cash tax windfall of approximately $15 million, which is reflected as a benefit to our tax expense and effective tax rate"
"Our full-year effective rate guidance of 21% to 22% includes the $15 million benefit recognized in the first quarter, and anticipates a much smaller benefit to be earned in the rest of the year"
Excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized in December 2016 were also $15 million
"This amount was reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017, with no impact to the P&L per the new standard"
The second accounting change is related to pension and postretirement benefits
"The new standard, ASU 2017-07, impacts where certain components of pension and postretirement benefit expense is recorded in the income statement"
"However, there's no change to net earnings or earnings per share"
"Under the new accounting standard, the traditionally more volatile components of benefit expense are now reported in other income and expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, and amortization of deferred amounts"
"Service costs remain in operating income, as it represents the services rendered in the current period by participants of these plans"
"We adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017, and re-classed approximately $8 million to other income and expense in the first quarter"
2016 amounts have been revised for comparability and were approximately the same amount in Q1 of 2016. Our 2017 estimate of expenses to be re-classed from operating income to other income and expense is $26 million
"Please go to slide number 18. Our Q1 spend for planned restructuring was approximately $33 million, related to consolidating three manufacturing plants and distributing their products to other facilities in the same region"
Facilities were in both our Climate and Industrial segments
The actions further our region-of-use philosophy to localize manufacturing and the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences
"We expect to spend approximately $0.15 per share for total restructuring expense for full-year 2017. Our corporate costs of $68 million for Q1 were generally consistent with our initial forecasts for the quarter, and were higher than last year due to planned incubator investments in technologies that benefit all businesses"
These investments are heavier in the first half of the year versus the second half
We also had an increase in other employee benefits and stock-based compensation timing
We continue to expect full-year corporate spend to total $240 million for the year
"Please go to slide number 20. As we've done for the last couple of quarters, I'll comment on a few topics that we know are of the interest to you before we open it up for questions"
I'll first touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside the U.S
Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength in the U.S
"dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and the Asian currencies"
"Overall, we continue to expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about a $0.10 negative impact on our earnings per share"
We also know price and material inflation is top of mind
Price was positive for us in the first quarter in both segments
"Material inflation offset positive price, driven by steel and Tier 2 components"
We have 10 basis points positive price covering material inflation in our guidance
We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation
"For 2017, we expect a negative first half price-to-material-inflation gap, and expect to recover in the second half"
"Please go to slide 21. Covering our transport business, we are on track with expectations"
"For 2017 overall, we continue to expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single digits year-over-year"
The North America trailer industry is expected to be down
We're also expecting a continuation for relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers
"Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia, and aftermarket revenues"
"Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record 2016 operating margins"
"And finally, I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial"
"Industrial drove strong first quarter organic bookings, up 9%, and organic revenue growth was a result of significant aftermarket growth in the compression technologies business and continued growth of Club Car"
"Looking at a regional perspective, organic revenue growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by declines in North America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa"
"As we indicated earlier, we expect the industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare definitive turning point yet on large equipment"
"Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up, and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, ongoing cost reductions, restructuring actions, and new product launches"
And now I'll turn it over to Mike for closing remarks
"I think that's right, It's a little heavier than $200 million, but not significantly"
"So – and I think what you have to think about there, and I know you are, is that bookings in that area last year was really the largest point of decline in, especially, the compression technologies business"
"So we saw some positive bookings in the first quarter, but those are going to translate into 2018. But you've got the right order of magnitude"
So let me start out with the bookings and the expectations
So we talked about in Q1 that the bookings were down slightly
"One of the things that I'd like to point out in that area is they were actually down about 1% year over year, which translates to about $6 million"
"So we knew that we were going to see the North America trailer markets down, we knew that we were going to have some strength in Europe in the truck markets"
"We also saw some strength in North America on truck, with the marine business being down"
"So there's a little bit of a mixture there, but we do still see that the biggest market that, I guess from a focus standpoint on North America trailer, is that that's going to be down for the year"
"We're a little bit more conservative than ACT with their 44,000 units, but we are calling that down"
"Well, so the maturity is August of 2018, and we're continually evaluating that, And I'll tell you what I'm balancing on that interest of rate 6.75% versus what we could get today, and I don't know if 2% is the right number, but let's assume that it's much lower than the 6.75% is"
"What's the right timing, in terms of the breakage of costs that go along with that? So in other words, if I want to refi now and do that, there is going to be a cost associated with that"
"And while I could easily disclose that to you, I sort of have a bias towards protecting shareholder value and saying, I'm not going to do that unless there is a really good reason to do that"
"So what drives a really good reason would be, is if I thought the rates were going to change dramatically, or I get more within the window"
"So continuously thinking about it, Nigel, but so far we haven't pulled the trigger on that, and we'll continue to look at it"
"But you're right, it would be lower interest than the 6.75%"
"So, actually what is sitting there in 2017 in terms of the train amortization is about $105 million, which is about what you said"
"That actually does not start to roll off, Nigel, until like 2023. So it isn't going to start rolling off in 2018, it's going to be roughly the same $100 million"
"So I think, Steve, that would be one of the other areas that I would watch in the second quarter"
So our material inflation in 2017 is coming primarily from steel and from Tier 2 commodities
"As we go throughout the year, we've talked about the first half is going to be a tough compare to last year, where we had a very positive spread between price and material inflation"
"On the material side itself, there's been some volatility, really post-election, in both steel, which will start to show up in the second quarter, as well as aluminum"
"And aluminum has a bigger impact on our residential business than what some people might think, we actually use – I'll give you a first quarter kind of antidote, where we used about 15 times as much aluminum as we did copper in the residential business in the first quarter"
So we're more impacted by that
"Having said all of that, we intend to be price positive throughout the year"
"We're watching the commodities, and we're also really, really focused on productivity and really offsetting any costs that we have"
"So monitoring all of the different pieces, but I'd really watch on materials"
"Scott, if I can just inject for just a second"
"On the – on the second quarter, I still expect for us to be upside down on the price-cost equation"
"So, there is a very tough comparison to the price-cost spread from the second quarter of last year"
"But I do expect second quarter to look somewhat like the first quarter of this year, price positive, but still seeing a negative spread between price and material inflation"
