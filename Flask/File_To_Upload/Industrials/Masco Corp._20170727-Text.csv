"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone"
"As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items"
Turning to Slide 6. Our continued execution drove solid top and bottom-line growth
The second quarter of 2017 was our 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth
"Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 4%"
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our second quarter revenue by approximately $23 million as the U.S
dollar strengthened against both the Euro and the British pound
North American sales increased 4% in the quarter due to strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as we continue to experience strong consumer demand for our better and best product offerings
"As a reminder, repair remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales"
International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter as our international Plumbing businesses continue to drive growth
"Gross margins expanded approximately 60 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.8%, largely due to the improvement in our North American Windows business"
Our SG&A as a percent of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points to 18.5% of sales
"This slight increase is partly due to the strategic growth investments we’ve made, such as the 200 new Behr hub store employees we hired last year"
We will continue to leverage these investments to drive profitable growth
"We delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 4% to $357 million with operating margins expanding 30-basis points to 17.4%, our strongest operating margin in nearly 15 years"
"Our EPS was $0.60 in the quarter, an improvement of 30% compared to the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, our results in the second quarter of 2016 included a one-time loss on debt extinguishment of $40 million or approximately $0.08 per share to complete the retirement of debt maturities"
Turning to Slide seven
Our Plumbing segment once again delivered outstanding results despite a difficult 9% comp
"Segment sales increased 5%, excluding the impact of currency driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas"
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment’s sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter
"Our North American sales grew 4% in the second quarter against a 9% comp as we experienced strong consumer-driven demand for our innovative products and industry-leading brands with wholesale, large retail and dealer customers"
"As Keith mentioned, Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins each delivered a record quarter of sales and profits"
"Our international Plumbing sales increased 5% in local currency against an 11% comp as Hansgrohe continues to outperform and benefit from investments in brand, design and innovation"
"Additionally, we’re focused on growing key markets as yielding results as they experience strong double-digit growth in China"
"Operating profit for this segment increased 3% in the quarter driven by incremental volume, which was partially offset by some of our strategic growth investments"
Turning to slide eight
The Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 5%
"This performance was driven by another strong double-digit growth of our BEHR PRO business and solid performance of BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point offering"
Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top line performance as it continues to benefit from the expansion and growth of its innovative shower door program
"Liberty continues to win new retail programs and was recently awarded an expanded cabinet hardware program, which will be set in the third quarter"
"As a result of this program win, we anticipate incurring approximately $10 million in program reset costs in the third quarter"
"Operating income in the second quarter increased 1% driven by increased volume, which was partially offset by an unfavorable price-to-commodity relationship in coatings as we discussed last quarter"
Turning to slide nine
"In the Cabinetry segment, excluding the impact of currency, sales declined 3% in the quarter"
This is principally due to the exit of certain low-margin builder business in the United States and in the U.K
These actions in aggregate reduced segment sales by approximately $10 million
Foreign currency translation also negatively impacted this segment’s sales by approximately $2 million in the quarter
"Starting in Q3, we expect to see year-over-year segment sales growth"
Our repair and remodel business continue to perform well in the quarter
"KraftMaid had solid performance in the retail and dealer channels, delivering mid-single digit growth through increased volume"
This performance was achieved against a tough double-digit comp
Segment profitability declined in the second quarter by $7 million as we experienced a more normalized sales and marketing spend as compared to the second quarter of 2016 and softness in our U.K
Cabinet business
"As we look to the third quarter of 2017, we expect to incur incremental costs of approximately $7 million related to new product launches as we continue to enhance KraftMaid’s product assortment and due to the recently announced antidumping duties and countervailing tariffs on imported Chinese plywood"
We expect the effect of these duties to be temporary as we work to mitigate the impact through supply chain and other initiatives during the remainder of the year
"Turning to slide 10. Excluding the $5 million impact of currency translation, our Windows segment sales increased 7% in the second quarter driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S"
"window business, which grew 10% in the quarter"
"Milgard’s strong growth was due to increased volume, a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing"
"Segment profitability in the quarter increased $20 million over the prior year driven by the lapping of last year’s warranty expense, cost-savings initiatives and favorable pricing"
We are extremely pleased with the rapid progress that Joe and his team have made on Milgard’s turnaround and their improved results delivered in the first half of 2017. We also completed the sale of our Arrow Fastener business at the end of the second quarter
"This will reduce second half of 2017 sales and operating profit by $38 million and $8 million, respectively, split roughly evenly between the two quarters"
We remain confident in our ability to achieve top-line growth and mid-single-digit margins in the segment for the second half of 2017 and the full year despite the sale of Arrow
And turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity
"Working capital as a percent of sales increased 170 basis points versus the prior year to 15%, principally due to the higher inventory to support our growth in new program wins"
We believe we will have this inventory work down to a more normalized level by the end of the year
"During the second quarter, we continued our initiative to create shareholder value by repurchasing 1.2 million shares valued at approximately $42 million"
"And we also took further actions to strengthen our balance sheet by refinancing high coupon debt, thus reducing our interest expense by approximately $3 million per quarter starting in the third quarter"
"And with that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Keith"
"And John, just to address your second question about interior versus exterior sales"
"While we don’t break that out specifically, I can give you some guidance and that’s generally, interior sales far outpace exterior sales at least in our business"
"So this will all hit in the third quarter, John"
This year -- and it’s not -- it’s paint
It’s actually in the Liberty Hardware program reset that we’re doing
"And so relative to the third quarter of last year, it will be incremental"
"Yes, Stephen"
"So the way I look at it is pretty simple, yes"
"In terms of these charges in the $1.93 to $2, yes, they are"
"So the way I think about it is you have $10 million in the Decorative Architectural segment for Liberty, you’ve got the $8 million hit in the second half of the year for the Arrow profit that -- given the divestiture"
Then we’ve got the incremental $7 million in the Cabinet segment for the launch costs as well as the incremental tariffs
"So in aggregate, approximately $25 million"
"Favorably offsetting those charges is the $3 million per quarter of interest expense, so call that roughly $19 million to $20 million of headwinds in the second half that are included in our guidance for the $1.93 to $2 which equates to roughly $0.04 a share"
"Yes, Chris"
We think largely that the builder-direct business and the builder-oriented businesses that we’ve been purposefully exiting over the course of the last 4 to 6 quarters is largely behind us now
"Could there be a little bit of spillover into the third quarter? Clearly, there could be just a touch"
"But we really do think that starting now, here in the third quarter of 2017, we should begin to see that segment reposition itself from one that’s been contracting to one that’s going to start to grow"
I think you see the fundamental growth in that business over the course of the first half of the year
"And what we’re seeing and hearing from our customers, Scott, gives us the confidence"
We’re hearing about good showroom traffic at our Cabinet dealers and our Plumbing wholesale dealer -- our Plumbing wholesalers and Plumbing showrooms
"So we’re seeing good demand, continuing good demand in our paint business"
"So all that combined, I think gives us the confidence to raise that lower-end of the range"
"A couple of things, Scott"
"Maybe on the corporate expense side, we are up a little bit this quarter, probably due to the stock comp expenses, the share price rises, obviously, that hits us a little bit harder in the corporate expense side"
So that was the principal driver there
"That said, we still think we’re going to be in approximately $100 million for the full year"
"And in terms of the share repurchase activity, there are number of things going on"
"Obviously, we had our Investor Day and you were there and we had the debt transactions going on"
So we were out of the market a little bit more around in some of those events than we would typically have been in a normal quarter
"That said, we still have our guidance out there for the $400 million to $500 million for this year"
"And as we’ve discussed in the past, we’ll be opportunistic about how we buy back those shares"
"And so yes, I would look for slightly stronger activity as we go into the third quarter and beyond"
Yes
"Sure, Bob"
"In terms of the margin profile of the business, right? We’ve got very strong incremental margins on this business"
"And it’s not only on the core business, but the repair/remodel businesses is quite good"
"But then also, the builder business that we are looking at going forward, can be strong as well"
And so we generally look at this segment to have between 35% drop down on incremental sales
So very good position there
"So as you think about how we developed though in 2016, we had very strong margins in the first half, Bob"
"You might recall, we had I think 10.5% margins or so in Q1 last year, then they popped up to about 14% on some like-spend in Q2. Then they tailed off a little bit in the second half of the year because I think we were closer to 8%, 8.5% margin for each -- of Q3 and Q4 last year"
"So as you think about the comps that we’re up against on the second half of last year, and the trajectory that we’re having in the business, the fact that Keith talked about earlier about both top line growth and margin expansion in the year for this segment, we feel pretty confident that we can achieve those"
"That’s the right way to think about it, Bob"
"To give you -- I mean, a little bit more detail on that"
"I think obviously, a big chunk of that comes down to volume and what we see going into 2018. Obviously, we love the progression that we’ve made so far here in 2017. And so I think if we get higher volumes that -- and clearly, [indiscernible] will help -- recall we’ll have -- we still have a little bit of ERP headwind going into 2018 that’s why we’ll still -- and not -- it won’t be incremental at all, but we’ll still have $3 million to $4 million a quarter of ERP spend as we go into 2018. So that could be a little bit of a governor on net margin expansion"
"But I think once that falls off, then I think we’ve got a pretty good path to getting to that double-digit margin"
About 1.5 years
"Yes, Neal"
"I’d say we probably did, in the first quarter in particular we got a little bit ahead of raw material with price"
"That said, in my prepared remarks and I think Keith referred to as well, we had a little bit of pricing headwinds in the second quarter"
And just given where the commodities are we anticipate probably some very modest inflation going into the second half of the year
But nothing that we’re too concerned about
"And Neal, I misspoke just a second ago"
"I said price headwinds, I meant commodity headwinds"
"We think that our repair, remodel top line growth of kind of mid-single digits is right in line with industry growth and if not, a little bit better"
We didn’t really see a lot of choppiness that the [indiscernible] may have implied in our business
"And we had pretty consistent performance through the quarter, Mike"
"So we’re really pleased with how the KraftMaid brand is performing, and we’re really excited about this new launch that Keith described a little while ago"
So we think there’s opportunity for continued steady growth in our repair/remodel side of our Cabinet business
And could you also give us some color in terms of what type of growth you saw out of the builder hardware business this quarter?
"Recall, Nishu, that the second half, or I’m sorry, the second quarter, all margins were at about 21%"
"They were down from the second quarter of last year, so we did start to see some of that commodity headwind hit the segment in the second quarter"
"And to Keith’s point, we’ll probably feel a little bit more margin pressure in the second half of the year"
"Yes, Nishu"
"It’s going to be roughly equivalent in the first half of ‘18, so that’s good catch"
I should have probably mentioned that in my remarks
"So yes, that’s a, that will be the waterfall effect of the remaining piece of the over divestiture"
"And just to be clear, on the Cabinet piece, there’s no divestitures per se"
"But rather, we are deliberately walking away from some low-margin builder business, both domestically as well as internationally"
And so that’s the impact
"Yes, it was about, as I mentioned, it was about $10 million of impact in second quarter"
"And could there be a little bit of spillover into third quarter? Yes, there could be, but we don’t anticipate very much"
"So Stephen, when we gave out the $1.90 to $2, obviously, the Liberty reset costs were not included in that number"
"Some of the Cabinet launch costs we were -- in our forecast, but the plywood tariffs were unknown at that time"
And that’s the bulk of the $7 million number there
"The Arrow divestiture was underway, but not particularly well publicized at that time"
And so it was not necessarily called out-- so in -- for the interest savings
"So you can make an argument that Keith and I knew about the -- that we’re going to divest Arrow, but probably the Street didn’t"
And there was a high degree of -- there was a huge factor on that Arrow in our $1.90 to $2 guidance
"Yes, that’s right"
"$0.035, $0.04."
There was currency effect
"And also Stephen, we’ve been factoring the Arrow divestiture in the second half of the year"
"That said, we still think that Milgard can grow nicely"
"Probably, slightly easier comp"
"Recall, we had a little bit of an ERP issue in the second quarter of last year"
And so that probably impacted a little bit of our revenue
But we feel really confident about what Joe and the team have established with respect to the Milgard brand and then how they brought sales back so quickly
So we do think that there’s good growth in front of us
"We’re seeing very good demand with our customers out there, both our dealer customers as well as we do sell a little bit into the major retailers in the Western U.S"
And we’re seeing good demand on both sides of -- with both of those customers in the Western U.S
Yes
They were doing the same thing that the U.S
"business was doing, but they also ran into a little bit of weakness"
I think -- we’re starting to see a little bit of softness broadly across the U.K
since -- with their election taking place in the quarter and the like
There was some softness and there was a little bit more discussion on the Brexit
So we’re seeing a little bit of the consumer pulling back in the UK
"But it’s not really a material part of the business, so we’re not too concerned about it"
"Well, a little bit of load-in related to new product going into some store shelves"
But I don’t think it was a significant -- anything significant that we should call out or nothing material to call out
