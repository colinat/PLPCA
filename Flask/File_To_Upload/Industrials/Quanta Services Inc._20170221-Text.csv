"Thanks, Kip"
"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and yearend 2016 earnings conference call"
"On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results"
"Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions"
"We finished 2016 on solid footing, with significant revenue and profitability momentum in the second half of the year"
"While I'm pleased with this substantial improvement, we're not satisfied and remain committed to returning our operating margins to historical levels"
Our third and fourth quarter results demonstrate progress towards that goal and our commitment to realizing the long-term earnings potential of the company
We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog
"I would note that our backlog does not yet include various projects we have been awarded that have ongoing permitting requirements, and which have an aggregate contract value well in excess of $1 billion"
We are confident that these projects will move forward and expect to include them in backlog when we have better visibility into final contract terms and probable construction starts
The American election and the potential positive impact the new administration's policies could have on our business has created a lot of press and speculation
We are hopeful that the regulatory reform will progress and owners permitting and approval processes will ease
"It is important to note however, that our end markets and related project opportunities do not rely on government funding to move forward and any additional government infrastructure support is incremental to our positive multi-year outlook"
We remain committed to providing dynamic and self-performed infrastructure solutions to improve America's infrastructure
"Electric Power segment revenues for the quarter were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2015, however, operating income and margins for the segment showed solid improvement"
"We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our Electric Power segment, and believe we are entering an upward multiyear cycle"
The end market drivers we have spoken about for some time continue to spur demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services
"These drivers, including the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas and regulation aimed at improving the reliability of the grid, are what we believe will continue to provide opportunities to grow our base business"
"Based exclusively on these projects, we are working on and have in backlog, our larger transmission project revenues should increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. Additionally, we believe larger transmission project awards will likely increase over the next 18 months, and should this occur, could provide improved visibility for the next several years"
"I believe we are uniquely well-positioned to provide solutions for these potential projects, some of which are the size and scope the industry has rarely experienced"
The macro environment in Canada has been challenging for the past couple of years for both our Electric Power and Oil and Gas operations
"However, we are seeing signs of recovery that could have a positive effect going forward, such as the Alberta Utilities Commission approval of the Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project in Canada, which we expect to start full-scale construction in the second half of this year"
"We have adjusted the cost structure of our Canadian operations as we move through these challenges, and we'll continue to do so as necessary"
"We are positioned to increase profitability, compete on our track record for safely executing projects on time and on budget, and we remain disciplined on pricing and project risk"
It is important to note that we do not operate our business to just accept only what the market brings us
We continually strive to innovate our solution offering and remain well ahead of industry trends
Our success in doing so over the years has played a critical role in establishing the leadership position we have today
I believe our scope and scale and competitive distinction in the markets puts us in a position to provide solutions that our end markets did not have in the past
"We've valued the collaborative relationships we have with our customers, and we'll continue to partner with them as they execute their capital deployment plans"
Turning to our Oil and Gas segment
"Revenues were strong, and operating income and margins increased substantially in the fourth quarter versus the same quarter as last year"
"Though we experienced some project timing issues on larger pipe projects during 2016, the year largely played out as we anticipated with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first, driven by a significant increase in larger pipeline project activity"
"We have been in active discussions and negotiations on a number of large pipeline projects that depending on construction start timing could give us incremental growth for the second half of 2017. While we expect to generate more larger pipeline project revenue in 2017 than in 2016, we believe 2018 could be even better and that the next several years could be a very good larger pipeline markets"
The vast majority of pipeline opportunities we see are driven by the need to move natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to various demand centers
"However, we believe out-year larger pipeline projects opportunities could include larger oil and natural gas pipeline projects in Canada"
These projects will provide desperately needed takeaway capacity for resources to access various markets in North America and meet the need for natural gas to fuel LNG export projects on the West Coast of Canada
"Additionally, development of liquid-rich natural gas formations in the Montney and Duvernay shales is beginning to increase demand for midstream infrastructure that could provide opportunity for us later this year"
"If production volumes increase over time, larger pipelines would also be needed to reach various end markets"
Quanta's pipeline operating units are some of the most established and respected companies in the industry and are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities as market activities increase
"In addition to larger pipe projects, we see opportunity for our base business to continue to grow over the coming years"
"Our base business includes supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services, natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering"
"Like our electric operations, larger projects complement our base business in this segment and we continue to develop unique infrastructure solutions for our customers"
"For example, we recently completed the REX Zone Three Capacity Enhancement project for the Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, where we provided turnkey engineering, procurement and construction services for the installation of three new compressor stations and the upgrade of two existing compressor stations"
This project is an example of our base business services providing a solution that led to a larger project
"And finally, on our first quarter earnings call last year, we announced that following the expiration of our telecom non-compete arrangement in December 2016, we intended to resume broad activity in the U.S"
telecom infrastructure services market
We have done that
A strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic and one of our strategic initiatives for the long-term growth is to find adjacent markets and new market opportunities
"Over the past several years, we have performing limited telecom and telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S"
", consistent with the terms of our non-compete arrangement"
"At the same time, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure service operations in Canada by leveraging our electric power resources, reputation and relationships"
We have also successfully greenfielded and grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets
There's a natural progression of these efforts in our success to expand our telecom infrastructure services operations in the U.S
"market, which we believe offers significant long-term growth opportunities"
"In light of a trial scheduled this week in the litigation around our non-compete, we will not be, as we had previously expected, in a position to talk more fully about our U.S"
telecom expansion strategy on this call
"Once the litigation has concluded, I will comment further about our U.S"
telecom expansion strategy
"That said, I would note that we do not believe there is any merit to the plaintiff's claims"
"In the pending litigation regarding the non-compete, the plaintiff has informed the court that it does not intend to seek any lost profit damages as a result of Quanta's activities"
"On December 3, 2016, the non-compete expired and Quanta is currently not subject to any restrictions on providing telecom infrastructure services in the U.S"
"In summary, overall, we had solid operating performance in the fourth quarter and believe the momentum we experienced in the second half of 2016 should continue into 2017. Our guidance announced this morning reflects growth expectations for both the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments over the next 12 months"
"As we typically do at the beginning of the year, we have taken a prudent approach to the revenue and margin range expectations in our guidance to reflect what we believe are possible outcomes based on the risk inherent in our business"
"As the year progresses and we gain better visibility in our performance, project timing and industry dynamics, we will adjust our guidance in commentary if needed"
"That said, we remain committed to and are strategically positioning Quanta to profitably grow over the longer term"
I hope my comments this morning have confirmed that we continue to have a positive multiyear view of end markets we serve
We believe we are entering a renewed multiyear up cycle for our Electric Power and Oil and Gas operations and are confident that we are well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers
"Our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by our collaborative relationships with our customers, which give us valuable insight into their multiyear infrastructure capital programs"
We are focused on operating the business for the longer term and continuing to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership
We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers
We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders
"We faced some challenges this year, and our employees performed well in a tough environment"
"As we close out 2016 with this call, I want to recognize their efforts and thank them for their commitment to supporting Quanta's unwavering dedication to health, safety, the environment and quality"
"We ended the year with more than 28,000 employees who I believe are the very best in the industry"
They are the key to our past and future success
"With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our fourth quarter results"
"Thank you, Tahira"
"Yeah, Tahira"
"The market is robust right now with some of the other projects, larger projects going into construction"
We're certainly optimistic that most of the projects on the back half will have the ability to fill it
"We're a little bit worried with Canada, just the overall economy there"
"So, we'll be cautious on how we guided the back half with the Canadian market as it is"
But we're optimistic that we can fill the back half here in with large pipe for the second half 2017.
"Really, Tahira, I think the industry is trying to move renewables across multi states, multi jurisdictions so you're seeing a lot of larger longer projects from a DC voltage even, AC voltage"
"So, you're starting to see us move across state lines, ISOs, independent operators"
"So as you start to see that, the projects get bigger, larger"
Some of them are long in nature from a standpoint of the beginning to the end
So you hear a lot about them and nothing happens for a long time
"So permitting, siting, all those things take a very – that's a long cycle on those larger projects"
"So, you hear a lot"
We see a lot of them out there
We're around the edges
We're optimistic that a few of them will go over the next three to five years here
Thank you
I think the projects that on the $1 billion or $1 billion plus is primarily pipeline
"We'll talk about them as we get a firm contract to start date to get the ability for us to understand the scope and the commitments that we have with our customers and be able to explain that in a firm nature, in a firm contract we'll, as they go into backlog, we'll make sure we communicate to the Street"
"But we're confident, these will go into construction"
I'm not privy to obviously what the shippers are saying
"But, I would say that in general, if you're moving heavy oil out of Canada, you want optionality"
"And I think as long as they are able to move to different geographic areas, you'll start to see pipe move"
You're railing most of it now
"So anywhere you have a rail line, it makes a lot of sense to have a piece of pipe"
So that alone will create markets on both coast lines there in Canada
"As we start to look to the lower 48 and some of the larger pipe here, same dynamics"
Shippers want optionality and our clients are in a robust environment to build pipe and we see it in Canada and the lower 48. We're in great positions on both sides of the border there
We're optimistic
We like the markets in the next three to five years
"It's robust in my mind from a bidding cycle, everything we can say about it"
"Basically, it's permitting delays and things of that nature that concern us"
"Thank you, Jamie"
"From the standpoint of you filling the back side and our margin capability there, I think utilization is a big part of that"
"As we fill it, we're optimistic that our margins will improve"
We need to fill the pipe
We need to see it go
"We'll be conservative until we do big pipes fast, book and burns fast"
So we'll be cautious on how we guide to that
"And as we fill it, we'll talk to you about it in the next quarter or the next quarter, whenever we fill it, if we fill it"
"Again, we're optimistic"
"The end markets are there, and I think we – I think, from our standpoint, we'll improve"
Our guidance will improve as we move forward through the year
"On the Wolfmack (37:26) project in Canada, I think we would say, in general, that that does strengthen our guidance"
"And so, but from that standpoint, I'm worried about the overall economic position in Canada and just in general the pressing of the business as far as going down on our margins and what Canada can do to the overall business"
"So, we're cautious on the Canadian markets"
"The spread capacity, Noelle, we're not at capacity in the either side"
"So, again, the way those spreads come on and off projects, it's very difficult to give you numbers"
"But in either case, we're not at capacity and certainly have room in the first quarter here and onward to book work"
"Yeah, Matt, and also just in general on the pipe margins and the seasonality, there's normal seasonality in the business"
"And so I think as you see us fill up work and execute, the margins have the potential to move upward and we'll be cautious about how we guide again"
"As far as FERC, our forecast, we don't need any large pipe to meet the midpoint of the range, so we're confident in our year-end guidance on the Gas side"
"Yeah, and on the Oil and Gas side, it did impact some of those spreads, and we were delayed some time there"
So you had some revenue impact there
"And then the Southeast where the storm hit, we have a large concentration of day-to-day MSA-type work, and that work was delayed along with it"
So there's some offset in the storm
We see our customers expanding their capital budgets in multiyear fashion the next three to five years
You start to see visibility in those capital programs
"So as that happens, we'll continue to grow that base business"
The recurring revenue type MSA work will continue to grow with our customers' capital budgets
"As far as the larger projects, as we see Canada, as you see Wolfmack (48:14) go in, some other larger projects that are out there, there's certainly the opportunity to win and execute on those"
"I do think the Electric segment is in a multiyear cycle, an upward cycle, and we're optimistic in the environment that we're in"
No
I think what we've just done is we've not factored in a market improvement in the Canadian environment
"We know as we've talked through 2016, we saw a degree of stabilization"
But I think it's too soon in the year to factor in some sort of distinctive improvement in the non kind of larger transmission side of the equation
"We do have those larger projects that are coming in, specifically at Fort McMurray, but that's going to be kind of probably back-end loaded into the year"
"And so the first half of the year, I think you still see with seasonality the aspect of being able to have some degree of margin pressure in the broader Canadian side of the equation"
But we think we've got the ability to go through and potentially see some degree of upside to the extent that you'll be looking at
But I think it's just too soon in the year to factor that in
Yeah
"The base business on the gas side continues to improve like the LDC market, local distribution market with the PHMSA rules that are in place to repair infrastructure, we're in a good environment to continue to see CapEx in those markets"
I think we'll continue to expand albeit off a smaller base
But that will continue to grow
"As far as telecom, we have our Latin American and Canadian construction going"
They're good markets
We have about $150 million to $200 million in our forecast that with those along with the Lower 48 here getting started
Good morning
We'll be cautious about how we talk about large pipe
"The book and burn and the amount of regulatory process that's involved in those projects, they're distinct, and we need to make sure that we have them, we're moving and we're mobilized before we communicate on them"
I do like the end markets in 2018. It's a robust market
I do think we'll fill up early and be able to talk more about that
"If we get some ease on regulation through the administration, we'll continue to talk to the Street about, as we get more positive and move into construction"
"Those things slip three months, it's a big impact to us, and we'll be cautious about how we talk to you"
I think the midstream business is a good business
We need to take away that capacity to go to the end markets
"As you start to see larger pipe get built, you'll see the midstream pick-up and the rig counts, obviously, there's takeaway and we're starting to see more rigs, so you'll start to see all those things happen and we're optimistic in that as well"
Yeah
"We never got out of the telecom business, to be clear"
We were always in the telecom business
We had certain things under the non-compete we cannot do
"And basically, the primary drivers were we were the telecom contractor or the contractor in the lower 48. We have the ability to do that today"
"So as we move forward, you'll see us in that market on the general side of this, and not just the Electric make-ready work"
So we're optimistic
The market is good
It's a robust market
We built our Canadian operations and our Latin American operations
So we'll participate both in North America as well as Latin America
We like the markets we've stayed at all along
And I'll talk more about strategy as we move forward
I'll leave it at that
Yeah
It's both
"In Latin America, I'd say 70% wireline, 30% wireless"
"Canada is primarily wireline, and the business has been growing double digits plus year-over-year"
Yeah
"I think in general, it does rely on some Canadian work to fill the back half, but again, I think the markets are there, the lower 48 could fill as well and bring the back half up"
So the opportunity on both sides of the border are there in the back half
We're building our base business nicely
"It becomes – you're getting people constrained at some point and so you have to be careful about where you're at in the world geographically, mountainous terrain and the qualified personnel that we have in the field"
And we'll be cautious about how we move forward in those markets due to the constraints on some of the people in the field
"And we train people every day, we're hiring every day"
"So as we get people trained, we'll put them in the market and how fast we can do that will dictate how our revenues go in the future"
Yeah
I'd like to thank you for participating in the fourth quarter 2016 conference call
We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services
This concludes our call
