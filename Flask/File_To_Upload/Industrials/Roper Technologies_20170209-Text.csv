"Thank you, Rob"
"Good morning, everybody"
"We'll start out by reviewing how the fourth quarter was, and a few comments about how the total 2016 finished"
Then a segment detail on outlook for each of the four reporting segments
"We'll look at how the first quarter looks from a guidance view point and the full year, establish our cash flow guidance for the year, and then take your questions"
"Next slide, slide five"
"So, if we look at the fourth quarter, we had record results in terms of orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, cash flow and a lot of other areas as well"
"Orders were really spectacular, up 17%"
Our book-to-bill was 1.07x
"For those of you who follow the company closely, we always say something like a 0.97x to 1.02x is a trend line that doesn't tell you all that much, but if you get below that or above that it tells you a lot, and this sort of rate tells you a great deal about 2017. We had organic order growth in all four segments, although I think Energy was maybe 0.1%"
"But it's still – that's the first time in a long time, organic orders were up 11%, now about half of that comes from the New York City tunnel project, but without that it's still very outstanding organic growth"
Our revenue in the quarter was up 7% to $1.18 billion with 2% organic growth
Our gross margin was up 50 basis points to $62.3 million
We're still making some margin improvement even with extraordinarily high numbers to begin with
Our EBITDA in the quarter was up 7% to $365 million and our operating cash flow for the entire year for the first time in our history exceeded $1 billion
We completed an important bond offering in December that sort of protected us from the vagaries of what might have happened going forward
The interest rates at the time certainly saved us a good deal of money
"We deployed $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, acquiring Deltek and ConstructConnect and these are really transformational acquisitions for us, partly because of their size"
"But they really take us into software end markets and professional services, gives us a lot more diversification than our software which had been concentrated in supply-chain activities and medical application"
"So, moving greatly into professional service gives us a lot of ramp around other things we can acquire over the next several years"
And it was a quarter-ago in which we hit several milestones and really some transformational things that outline how we're going to perform over the next three to five years
Next slide
"If we look at the income statement, you can see pretty much all those things reflected that we just commented on orders, revenue, gross profit"
The tax rate down there you can see was 29.8% versus 28.8%
"So it was a 1% headwind which cost us about $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, notwithstanding that DEPS were $1.86 versus $1.82 last year"
Next slide
Compounding cash flow is really what creates so much shareholder value for all of you over time
"And, here you can see that despite the Energy headwinds, which have been ferocious for the company for the last two years, it's really remarkable that we've had 19% growth over the last two years in operating cash flow, despite a huge cash headwind in Energy"
"So in the fourth quarter, our conversion of operating cash flow, you can see was 142%"
Our free cash flow at $259 million represented 25% of revenue
"And for the full-year, our operating cash flow, which is a little over $1 billion, with 149% conversion, we continue to move up sort of cash flow to revenue"
"Back in 2014, it was 23.7%, and of course people are scared to death we couldn't possibly maintain it, and here in 2016 it's 26.3%"
"So, everybody here is very proud of the $1 billion operating cash flow for the first time"
It's quite a milestone and hats off to everybody at Roper for doing that
Next slide
"The asset-light business model, this will really cement a critical awareness of people about just how big a cash compounder we are and we're going to be"
"If you look at this slide, which we generally show you each time, people often times think it just couldn't get better"
"In 2014, you see that our net working capital as a function of revenue was 5%"
Last year in 2015 it was 3.5%
"This year it's 1.8%, cut in half, and it's important to look at the component, so you can see inventories dropped from 5.1% to 4.6% in the last two years, receivables are up 20 basis points from 16.1% to 16.3%, payables and accruals are up 80 basis points from 11.1% to 11.9%, but the big change here is deferred revenue"
"Deferred revenue was 5% in 2014 year-end and in the fourth quarter, we exclude acquisition"
"So, in December 2015, we excluded Aderant and Atlas that had some deferred revenue, and yet it was still 6.5%"
"This year as we close out, we exclude ConstructConnect and Deltek and store up the 7.2%"
"This is hugely important because if you look on our balance sheet that's attached to the income statement, you'll see that deferred revenue in 2015 was $267 million"
"You'll now see that deferred revenue is up to $488 million, but this is not reflected in our graph here at 7.2%"
"So you can imagine that that 1.8% number, which is insanely low compared to multi-industry companies, is actually going to become negative in 2017. This is why we get so much more cash to revenue than virtually anybody else"
"It's truly a transformational change in our cash return and to get a concept of how important this is, ten years ago we told people that our inventory was 9% of revenue, today it's 4.5%"
"We told people receivables were 17.4%, today they are 16.3%"
"We told people payables and accruals were 15%, today they are 11.9%"
"But now we have 7.2% of deferred revenue and as we report in the first quarter, you'll see that number escalate"
"So all of the acquisitions that we've been doing the last two years, $5.5 billion worth of investment, has helped to drive these incredible numbers to rates that just haven't been seen before"
Next slide
Here we look at the segment detail and we'll look at each of the four segments
Next slide
We start with Energy Systems
The Energy Systems business actually had a book-to-bill of 1.02x
"We had organic growth in orders in the Energy segment of 7%, so you got a little bit of improvement in the fourth quarter"
"Organic revenue, trailing of course is still minus 8%"
"Oil and gas was down about 15%, but that's actually the best negative V for a while"
"So headwinds have really been abating in that and this Energy segment, about two thirds of it is oil and gas related activity"
"The Industrial Test and Measurement portions of the business actually grew, and we had this sort of positive book-to-bill ratio around that"
"In 2017, we think the segment'll be sort of flat to low single-digit growth, off of the base that you see here"
"Then if we look at the Industrial segment, which is far less influenced by oil and gas, but nonetheless, still has Roper Pump in it, so that's a major component"
Its organic orders were up 1%
The organic revenue was down 1%
Material analysis was strong in the quarter
Neptune continued to perform brilliantly
"We had some sequential improvement for the first time at Roper Pump as rig counts moved up, and so Roper Pump sequentially was up about 8%"
"That said, that business alone in the last two years is off by $50 million of revenue and represents that drag that we've had"
We think that goes away this year
"If we look at the results for the segment as a whole, we think it's going to be up sort of low-single digits, because we won't get much out of the Energy portions, but we get a lot more out of the other pieces of that segment"
"If you combine these two when you look at it, which I was doing just in preparation here for the talk today, the combined revenue for these two was $321 million of revenue and had $98 million in OP"
So it's really remarkable how great these businesses are
There are 30.5% OP to sales in markets that have been declining
So the guys who run these businesses have really performed in an outstanding way the last two years
Next slide
We look at the Medical segment
You'll see a book-to-bill here of 1.09. Organic orders were up 8%
Total orders were up 15%
"Imaging revenue was down 4%, but Medical organic growth was up 5%"
"The way that we look at the businesses, there are really three primary areas, the Acute Care Software business, and it was up led by connectivity solutions between the lab instrumentation that we provide software for and the data gathering requirements that the hospital needs"
"And then, Strata's Decision Support Software continues to grow at a spectacular rate"
"The Alternate Site Healthcare business, which includes MHA, but very importantly includes our Software businesses, SoftWriters and SHP, the Software businesses grew well and the Long Term Care Pharmacy business grew in the fourth quarter"
"The medical products business, which includes a variety of physical products, its growth was led by Northern Digital, and we have technology that a rapidly increasing people of OEMs that we really sign contracts with, I can't discuss because of the proprietary nature of the product, have really interesting growth opportunities in Electromagnetic Measurement Technology area, and we're really at the forefront of that"
"So, there is some very important people that we've been working with, and increasingly signing those up, and prospects for that area are quite good"
Scientific Imaging in the quarter was up on orders
It's about 15% of the segment these days
"Book- to-bill was the strongest it's been over the long time at 1.12. In 2017, we actually believe Imaging will grow because of the cryo-EM opportunity that we have there and certain spectroscopy technology that we introduced this past year"
"In Medical, we just think we get sort of broad-based medical growth continues at kind of mid single digit growth that we've enjoyed for several years, and there are a series of initiatives that really we're culminating in 2016 and the early part of this year that should make our performance in a growth area, internal organic growth, brighter in 2018 and beyond than it's been in the recent past"
"And the Medical segment, really in the last two years, is up $283 million in revenue"
"So, that has largely offset the sort of drag, about $265 million drag, we had out of Energy and Industrial, and especially when you exclude the Abel disposition"
Next slide
Here we would look at RF Technology
"That segment will explode of course in 2017. You can see on the chart here, its book-to-bill was 1.10 in the fourth quarter"
"Organic orders were up 24%, a good deal of that was the New York City tunnel project, most of which got booked in the fourth quarter, and total orders are up 38%"
Organic revenue was up 8%
"Growth in the toll and traffic applications was strong in the quarter, and, importantly, we had a faster start to the all-electronic tolling in the New York City bridge and tunnel program than we expected"
"We did about $15 million in the fourth quarter, and that leaves us, the total project is about $52 million for the installation and technology purchase"
So it gives us maybe $37 million for the coming year
Then there is another $20 million in maintenance that lasts for like $5 million a year for four years to get us back to the $72 million number we were talking about
So excellent start to that
We had sort of middle single-digit organic growth in our Software businesses
Freight matching did a little better than that
"CBORD had a particularly strong quarter, up double digits with security deployments for universities"
Aderant continued to lock in gain share in the large law office component
"We completed the Deltek and ConstructConnect acquisitions, which really greatly expands our application software footprint and capabilities"
It gives us some new platforms for growth in professional services
There are a lot of interesting things; end markets to explore and other things to bolt on to the business
"And if you look over at this revenue graph, you see it going from $904 million to $1.224 billion"
"We put this 2017 chart on there, we'd have to change the whole page, because we're going to do over $1.9 billion in RF & Software in 2017. So, in 2014, it was up $47 million, and in 2015, it was up $86 million"
"Last year, it was up $187 million"
It'll be up $650 million to $700 million or more this year
"So we think we'll continue in 2017 with strong software growth, with really incredible cash performance out of this businesses"
"We'll continue to grow in toll and traffic projects, but a lot of this is trans-suite (17:35) software projects, which don't involve toll tax"
"So for the year, we should have nice growth out of completing the New York City project and the continuation of our Saudi project, but we're going to have fewer tag shipments and we've seen a fall-off in tags in 2016 related to railcars, which wouldn't surprise anybody and people tend to forget about it"
But we have a tag on every railcar that gets produced
Next line is our segment revenue is expected to grow about 60% with huge contributions from ConstructConnect and Deltek
Incrementally those people will probably add about $650 million of revenue this year versus last year when we got a little bit of contribution out of them in the fourth quarter
"In total then, organic revenue ought to be sort of in the mid single-digits, but the big story is all the added growth that you see there"
Next slide
Next slide is just a page identifier that we're going to now talk about 2017 guidance
So we'll go to the next slide
"In establishing the 2017 guidance, we've got an adjustment in terms of what we're adding to our adjusted numbers"
A lot of people have asked us about this
"We've sort of explained our view historically, and a increasing number of you think this is something we ought to do"
We've given it a lot of thought
We've looked at a lot of information and do think it is a better way to report our earnings with taking the acquisition-related intangible amortization affecting it by tax and including it in the adjustment
"So you'll see we didn't talk about that at all during the fourth quarter discussion, but we'll be talking about it from now on, as the way we'll report earnings and compare our performance against the prior year"
There is additional information you'll see in our appendix that can help you with that
Full year 2017 guidance then would be an adjusted earnings number of $8.82 to $9.22 a share
"That represents about 20% to 22% revenue growth for the company in 2017, of which 3% to 5% would be organic"
"We're assuming a tax rate of about 30%, everybody has heard the conversations about how much somebody like Roper would be benefited if you had a change in business tax, but for our guidance we're going with 30%"
"Now, it's true that a very high percentage of our income is in the U.S"
", so we're as interested as any of the rest of you are on what's going to happen to tax rates in the U.S"
Operating cash flow is up 15% from last year
"We're saying operating cash flow would come in at $1.150 billion, up from $1 billion last year"
"And our Q1 guidance is $1.92 to $2 a share, only an $0.08 spread in there, and the reason for that is, of course, we're into the quarter already, so we have a pretty good view about that"
"For the full year, we've established a $0.40 variance at $8.82 to $9.22 with the midpoint of $9.02. You should know that, in the first quarter, Deltek was seasonally soft in the first quarter, just how their business is and then up dramatically in the second quarter and so they do have a little seasonality in the way the incoming renewals and new business gets generated"
"If we look then to the next slide, we can kind of summarize kind of how the year wound up and how we're positioned for this current year"
"As we said, we had record results for orders and revenue, net earnings, EBITDA and cash"
Really significant milestones
"In the fourth quarter, it's the first time we've ever had $1 billion in quarterly revenue and of course you can see from our guidance it's going to be more of the norm in the future"
"Of over $1.5 billion in backlog versus $1.07 billion the last year, so we're up about $508 million in backlog going into the year"
We have $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first time
"Now we look back at what we said at the beginning of last year, our guidance was, we can do about $1 billion and we actually did a little over $1 billion for the first time"
Really a transformational year for us on many levels
We invested $3.7 billion in software acquisitions this year after $1.8 billion the year before
"And half of our EBITDA in 2017 is going to come from our Software and Network businesses and the other half from products, some of those are medical products"
We're looking for about 20% revenue growth in 2017. We have really broad based opportunities
It's a better situation for us as we enter 2017 because the macroeconomic drivers fit our businesses really well
That headwind that we've had to bite through over a $265 million dividend in the Energy is gone
"And the end markets we see are much more optimistic and our business leaders were sort of 80% through our 2017 review process with the field and the optimism is pretty good, maybe even better than what we're willing to endorse yet"
"We're going to continue to expand and compound our cash flow, and I think being up 15% cash flow in 2017 over 2016, and a business that's basically not cyclical anymore, is a pretty good achievement"
"So we've got great results and very, very strong exciting momentum as we go into 2017 and beyond"
"And with that, Rob, let's open it up for questions"
Question-and-Answer Session
"Hey, good morning, Scott"
"I don't think it's anything related to post-election activity or people holding up because of where the orders are, right? So, you didn't have a negative dip in orders in Industrial or Energy, so that helps at the beginning, right?"
"And then, you had an unusual situation with a large book boarded for (25:07) the tunnel project"
"If you took that out, then organic orders are more or like 6% or something like that"
I think that the improvement in Medical was pretty good
"The people think about the Sunquest lab business, but it's actually the Acute Care Software business and it's doing really well, it's just that the lab business has been on the laggard for the last two years organically even though it's continued to be improve, but the ancillary things around it are growing at double-digits"
"So, they are getting bigger and their growth is organic and it comes in and you see stronger support"
"Same thing, we went through a little bit of a hiccup in MHA at the beginning of 2016, and we're constantly monitoring drug issues and pricing and what's happening with generics, and what's happening with the things we serve, which are not the big risk drug things"
"So, MHA is improving a bit, but the two software components that go into home health and alternate site treatment for people are performing exceptionally well"
"Again, these are sort of double-digit growers"
"So, I think that's good and then we had – generally our CBORD business does really well in Q2, and that's most of the year, but it had pretty good Q4. There is a level of optimism"
"Throughout our reviews that we do each business, a year ago, people were really apprehensive and nervous and you don't get that from anybody"
"So, I think as Rob and myself, and John and Paul put these numbers together for the year, our governance model creates what you see in the way of guidance"
"Maybe there will be some better euphoria throughout the year, but we're not banking on it"
"It was down, I can tell you it was actually up 8% in revenue sequentially"
"in the fourth quarter over the third quarter, but the – not the orders, but the revenue, so"
All right
"Hey, good morning, Shannon"
Yeah
"As far as the reporting convention, it's always been in our number"
So this is not a change
We've decided to split it away from the payables and accruals line in order to show the increase in that deferred revenue side
"I mean, look, there is always more opportunity on all these line items, right, whether it's receivables or inventory or payables"
But I do think most of the future improvement will continue to be the growth that we see in software and we get paid in advance for that
And so that continues to build the deferred revenue balance
I anticipate that's where we'll see most of the incremental change
"Of course the change in the first quarter will be substantial, because we'll be able to roll in a full quarter of deferred revenue for ConstructConnect and Deltek in addition to their revenue"
