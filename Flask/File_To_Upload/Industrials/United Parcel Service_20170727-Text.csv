"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone"
"Earlier this year, we laid out our 2017 full year plans, as well as our three-year target"
"At the midpoint of the year, the business is performing as we expected and we are pleased with our progress"
"Looking closely at the second quarter, total revenue increased 7.7%"
"Adjusting for currency, top line growth was nearly 9%"
The revenue was balanced across all segments with shipment growth throughout the product portfolio
"Earnings per share were $1.58, up almost 11% over last year with good, core performance within the segments"
"In addition, there were several items that positively contributed to the quarter"
Most of these were expected
"First, net fuel year-over-year was a benefit"
"In 2016, fuel prices accelerated through the quarter from April through June"
"At the time, we had a two-month fuel surcharge revenue delay and were unable to offset the increase in fuel prices"
"In early February, we adopted a two-week revenue lag"
"In addition, there were other fuel policy changes that increased the overall revenue-to-expense coverage ratio"
Another positive contribution occurs as a result of lower workers' compensation cost in the second quarter
"We've gone to quarterly, rather than semi-annual, outside independent studies to refine our estimates of our workers' compensation liability"
"Finally, it was a one-time benefit that the Supply Chain & Freight segment received this quarter"
Together these three contributed approximately $0.10 per share
The majority of the benefit came from fuel and workers' compensation that we had anticipated
"Now, let's turn to the details of each segment"
In the U.S
", revenue increased more than 8% due to several factors; volume growth, Easter in the second quarter, and higher fuel surcharges, which added about 120 basis points"
Total shipments increased almost 5% with growth accelerating across the products
"Deferred Air led the way, up 11%, and Next Day Air was up more than 6%"
"Ground shipments also increased more than 4%, driven by SurePost and residential deliveries"
Strong B2C expansion continued with growth in the low teens
"And despite the acceleration of brick-and-mortar store closings, B2B has sequentially improved and moved into positive territory"
Yield management initiatives contributed to revenue-per-package growth of 3% during the quarter
Strong base rates and higher fuel surcharges offset product mix changes
Operating costs were pressured by higher fuel prices
"In addition, the cost penalties associated with 20 projects under construction and the deployment of Saturday operations continued in the second quarter, but were offset by the workers' compensation benefits I mentioned earlier"
Operating profit increased 13% to $1.4 billion and margin expanded 60 basis points to 14.3%
"The strong shipment growth, combined with the UPS initiatives, contributed to the gains"
"Now turning to the International segment, which delivered another quarter of good top line growth, combined with positive operating leverage on a currency-neutral basis"
International revenue increased 2.8%
"Adjusted for currency, growth was 8.3%"
Demand for our unmatched export solutions remained high as shipments were up 12%
"Europe continues to lead the way, with mid-teens growth to key trade lanes and intra-Europe"
The Asia-to-U.S
trade lane remained strong with double-digit growth again this quarter
Reported operating profit was $583 million down 4.9%
"After adjusting for currency, operating profit expanded almost 14% to $697 million"
"As a reminder, you can review our currency-neutral results on the web schedules"
"Now, looking at Supply Chain & Freight, the segment produced another solid quarter of financial results"
Revenue was up 12% and reported operating profit improved by 24%
Year-over-year gains in operating profit included a benefit from a legal settlement
"When removing the impact of this $20 million one-time item, profit growth was still very strong"
All the major supply chain business units contributed to the improvements this quarter
"In forwarding, tonnage increased across all three products with International airfreight growth in the mid-teens, and North American air and ocean freight up mid-single digits"
"Distribution revenue increased at a low-single-digit pace, as strong growth in retail, aerospace and mail services were mostly offset by declines in the high-tech sector"
Operating profit and margin improved over 2016. UPS freight revenue was up 9% on strong LTL tonnage gains of more than 8% as market conditions in U.S
trucking industry continue to recover
Operating profit and margins improved as the business continued to focus on growth from middle-market customers
"Through the first two quarters of 2017, we are encouraged by the gains all the business units are making within the Supply Chain & Freight segment"
"Now, let's turn to cash flow"
UPS ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and marketable securities as the business continued to generate strong returns
"We are focusing our capital on building the smart logistics network, creating flexibility through a strong balance sheet and distributing returns to our shareholders"
"On a year-to-date basis, capital expenditures are $2 billion, putting us on track to lead our CapEx guidance range of 6% to 7% of revenue"
"In late June, we announced changes to our non-union U.S"
This change stabilizes our risk obligation and lowers the liability on our balance sheet
"We are moving to a pay-as-you-go, enhanced 401(k)-style plan starting in January 2023. The new plan will be more predictable and sustainable"
"Moving to shareholder returns, at this point in the year, we have distributed about $2.3 billion"
We have repurchased more than 8.4 million shares for just over $900 million and paid out nearly $1.4 billion in dividends up over 6% per share over the last year
Now I want to discuss our guidance
Through the first two quarters we've had good performance as we expected
"My earlier comments outlined favorable items from the second quarter, including fuel, the change in workers' compensation, and the one-time benefit in Supply Chain & Freight"
We expect minimal impact from these items in the second half of the year
"Looking forward, our plans are influenced by the previously announced currency headwinds and a few other moving parts"
"In the third quarter, considering the combination of currently known and anticipated factors, including one less operating day, earnings per share should be relatively flat when compared to last year"
"In the second half of the year, our tax rate will be about 35%"
"Keep in mind, in the fourth quarter of 2016 we had tax benefits of approximately $0.05 per share"
"This benefit is not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter of 2017, which will weigh on the comparison"
"In addition to the quarterly items, we continue to monitor both the economic and business trends that impact our business"
"Externally, we've looked at all the currently available data and our internal plans, and we're confident in reaffirming our 2017 guidance for earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, which includes about $400 million in unfavorable currency impact"
"At this point in the year, we are right where we expected to be and we are encouraged by the progress across all three segments"
The entire enterprise is responding well and making the necessary adjustments to generate solid performance as we execute on our revenue and strategic initiatives
"At the same time, we are investing aggressively, implementing Saturday operations, acquiring new capabilities, and buildings partnerships to grow the business"
"Through the first six months of the year, our proven strategy and operational flexibility has provided the targeted financial results we expected and the company is on track to achieve the goals we laid out earlier this year"
"Before I turn it over to the operator, I want to remind you that the webcast users can submit live questions during today's call"
"Thank you for your time, and now I'll ask the operator to open the line"
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
"Actually, a large portion of it is in domestic and there also is in international"
"If you look back to 2016, David, what you would have seen is that the fuel prices were increasing between 35% and 40% during the quarter"
You recall we were still a two-month lag
"So, for example, while fuel price per barrel was somewhere in the mid-$40s on average for the second quarter, we were still using February's revenue to create surcharge, and that was $31 a barrel at the time"
"So it's really about a year-over-year and, actually, I went back and looked and we talked about last year on this same second quarter call that we had some headwinds because of that fuel change"
"Fortunately, we'd made that adjustment and what happened last year, cost actually kind of got pretty tight the rest of the year"
"And so, we expected in our plans that we would see a benefit because of the drag last year on that"
"On the workers' comp, what's really happened is because we're now doing quarterly studies instead of just twice a year, we've moved some of the benefit that we traditionally see in the third quarter into second quarter"
"And so, generally speaking, what we're trying to do is marry up with our actual experience in a more meaningful way on a quarter-by-quarter basis"
"And so we made that method up, that change, because we thought that was more prudent and also to understand how the business was really going"
"When you look at the second half of the year, we expect to have a strong second half of the year, good results"
"We talked about a few of the items that you have to take into consideration, but we feel like when you look at all the data that we've seen, we feel confident that the range that we've given you is something that we're going to deliver when you get to the second half"
"I would say between 70/30 and 80/20, somewhere in that range"
"Sure, this is Richard and I think that to start with, Chris, what you said is right"
"When you look at the first half of the year, we're right on plan"
business is adapting well
"International continues to, as Jim mentioned, to have good growth, and supply chain is recovering"
"As we looked, though, at the current data, what we also noticed is although we are seeing some positive trends in many of the different industry types in B2B, we're a little challenged because the number of stores that are closing is having an impact on growth in the B2B"
"And so the forecast for B2B, if you go back earlier in the year to today, is not quite as strong because of retail sales and also because industrial production forecasts were higher even three months ago to where they are today"
So we took that information and we looked at that against also some of the items that we called out that won't repeat in the second half of the year and we put it all together and we just didn't see enough new data that would suggest at this time we should adjust guidance
"Obviously, as in the past, if more information comes in and it's appropriate to suggest a change, we would communicate it appropriately"
"But, at this point, based on – we're adjusting to how the volume and the customer demand is changing and we feel comfortable with where we're at"
"Sir, and I'll take that"
This is Richard
"I think the first thing that I want to say is that we spent a lot of time, actually several years, evaluating different options to look at how do we manage the liability, remain competitive in the market from a benefit standpoint, and as we announced just over a month ago, we're moving to a pay-as-you-go 401k plan effective January of 2023. It will change our risk profile"
It will allow us to have more predictable and sustainable costs
It does reduce our future liabilities on the current balance sheet
And we'll also lower our exposure to the discount rates
"As discount rates change, we see both expense change on pension as well as the liability side, as well as the change that PBGC has made with increasing costs that we're having to put into the plan, but it doesn't go to the employees"
"For 2017, there is no change to the guidance because we have spent a few years on this and we knew we were making this announcement in June"
"There is no additional discretionary contributions to pension, and the reason there isn't is because we made them in the first quarter, as I talked about on the last call"
That was because of the PBGC premiums and taking advantage
"Now, upon announcement, we did have to remeasure the liabilities, and what we saw was discount rates were down about 32 basis points from the end of the year to the end of June"
"At the same time, because the equity markets have been stronger, we did see some offset from the higher return"
"Finally, when I put all of this together, it's really hard to talk about what it's going to do in future years because until you know what discount rates are doing, you don't really have an impact on your financials five years out"
"But what I can tell you is we spent a lot of time trying to balance what is right for our employees – most of them spend their careers at UPS, as well as managing the risk profile and the liabilities for UPS as a whole"
Thank you
"So, actually, a lot of these buildings are over multiple periods"
"And what we talked about in the investor conference is over the next three to five years, there would be somewhere around – between 28 million square feet that and 35 million square feet that would go in over the three to five-year period"
"And then talk David had this morning, he talked about we've announced almost 4.5 million square feet in 2017. Over the last year and a half, we've actually announced about 7.5 million square feet that's currently under construction, and just about 5.5 million square feet will open in 2018. Overall, it is in the guidance of the increase to 6% to 7% per CapEx of revenue, and that's really because you saw now for the last four quarters in the U.S"
", we've been having close to 5% or greater revenue growth"
We need these buildings in order to continue to grow
"These growth rates are higher than our historical average and we talked in the investor conference about the importance of growth and, at the same time, with our high return on invested capital, these assets will continue to allow us to nurture not only the ROIC, but also grow the top line and bottom line"
So we're on a path for the next three to five years
It's something we laid out at the investor conference and we are looking forward to that 5.5 million square feet opening next year
"So actually, just to step back for a moment, in 2017, we went to a – we were, historically, before 2017, used a collar approach and it was a stock market transaction"
What we did in 2017 is to do a transition because starting in 2018 we'll go to a dollar cost averaging where we're spreading it over a 36-month period
What that means is the year-over-year comparisons won't have big variations
But what it means for 2017 is that we do have a collar
"The increase over the last, probably few weeks, where the dollar has lost between 6% and 8% of the value is inside the collar"
"So for the hedge currencies, what that means is it's going to be right where we expected it to be, and for the unhedged, you'll have a slight difference in the overall"
"Now, if you recall, we called out during the first quarter, we had about $119 million drag from currency"
"This quarter, $114 million"
"Until the quarter closes, and each month closes, I won't know what the drag is and how much it changes because the most recent changes will impact July, and then whatever happens is going into August and September"
"But because we give you that new schedule in our web schedules, that will allow you to see"
"And as it comes down, we'll obviously communicate that, but right now, we're sitting at about $117 million this morning"
And that's right in the collar range that we had already set out
"But with the new program, the most important part is we won't see this year after year starting in 2018. And it's also important to remember when you look at the International business, we have an 18.4% margin even with the drag from currency, so we continue to have industry-leading margins because all the work Jim and his team is doing in growing the business and growing exports"
"And when we evolve to this new weighted average, we actually had explained that by doing that we would remove – that because what happens is for basically two-thirds of the comparison period, it's the same currency year-over-year"
It's only the head and the tail that will be different from the timing standpoint
"So, I'll start with the lease accounting and tell you that we are in the process, it's a 2019 implementation of preparing all of the leases that will have to be put on to the balance sheet according to the new accounting standard"
"Step back for a moment though and those kind of leases for UPS, while they'll be large because we are a large company, aren't large categories"
"For example, we're an integrator that owns our aircraft and we own an aircraft within our company"
"So when you see deposits, for example, we put those into the CapEx early because that's – we are putting in the deposits before we take ownership"
There are other companies around the world that don't always own their planes or they're off balance sheet so they have a different preparation than we would have
"That being said, it's a tremendous effort that we are going through and at the appropriate time when it's all put together, but like I said, we have more than a year-and-a-half till we get there"
"In terms of the capital, if you go back to our investor conference presentations, we did talk about the growth rate and as I mentioned, the last four quarters in the U.S"
"have grown almost 5% or more, which is above our historical norm on revenue"
"And you'll see that we continue to believe that what we're doing from an investment side is helping to support a flexible network ability to do more capacity and it's all part of the smart logistics network that we're creating and so we feel very comfortable with the 7.5 million square feet that we have under construction and the announcement that somewhere between 28 million and 35 million square feet will be completed, that we're building this really for the tremendous opportunity of e-commerce and how that's moving, shopping, from physical stores to online"
"So, if you – Allison, if you think about some of the things we laid out at the investor conference around the faster growth but also the solutions, things like that network planning tool, is really about the ability to adjust because one of the challenges in this online environment is understanding distribution patterns because they're not based on historical"
Some years you have heavier buyers in one part of the country than another
So the network planning tool allows us to make the adjustments in real time
"You think about what we're doing with Orion and the automation in the buildings, but when you look across the entire portfolio of CapEx, we're really building a network that's going to allow us to grow in a substantial way over the next three years to five years"
"And then on top of that, between synthetic density, Access Points, My Choice, all of those are about helping the transaction to be completed for the end user in a way that's convenient and gives them some choice in how they receive their package"
So we feel like we've laid out a good roadmap
"We feel like we're taking into account the structural shift from physical stores and we're going through the process, as I said, a moment ago, and building those buildings that we need to make this all work as online continues to grow faster"

"Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC No, go ahead"
We're going to take an online question real quick
It's going from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan
How has the initial roll out of Saturday delivery been received by shippers and UPS drivers?
"Yeah, so Jeff, this is Richard"
"And, very specifically, shares do decline"
You have different periods when you're increasing your shares for their compensation plans versus the even buying back
But there is a decline this year in shares of 4 million to 5 million shares
"And remember, it's an average that you use in your calculations, not where you are at the spot when it occurs"
