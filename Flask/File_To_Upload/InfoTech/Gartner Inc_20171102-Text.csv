"And good morning, everyone"
"Because of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution and our exceptional business model, we delivered another strong quarter"
"On a combined basis, our adjusted revenue grew 11% in the third quarter of 2017. As Gene detailed, we are also progressing in accordance with our plans to integrate CEB into the Gartner business"
"Please keep in mind that as we discuss our results, we will be looking at the total combined company on both a GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue basis"
"As we discussed last quarter, the only difference is that adjusted revenue excludes the deferred revenue fair value adjustment that is required as a part of purchase accounting"
"We will also, where appropriate or applicable, drill into the traditional Gartner or traditional CEB business performance"
You will also find an in-depth overview of our Q3 performance in a presentation on our Investor Relations website
Turning to our Q3 performance
"Our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 11%, driven by 15% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 1% decline for the acquired CEB business; combined adjusted EBITDA of $149 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS of $0.65 per share, which is $0.13 above the top-end of our guidance range for the quarter"
Please note that our third quarter 2017 GAAP revenues of $828 million includes an approximately $64 million deferred revenue adjustment
"Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our revenue for the quarter was $892 million"
Our exceptional business model continues to create a consistently high-level of free cash flow conversion
"On a combined basis, over the last rolling four quarters, our free cash flow conversion was 139% of adjusted net income"
"I'll now discuss our third quarter combined business segment results and P&L in depth, highlighting the performance of the traditional Gartner and acquired CEB business where appropriate before turning to our balance sheet and cash flow dynamics"
I'll close with remarks on our updated 2017 guidance
We will then be happy to take your questions
"Please note that my segment discussion will focus on the adjusted revenue and adjusted contribution margin performance in Q3, therefore, adding back the deferred revenue fair value adjustment I just mentioned"
Please also note that we've included a lot of this information in the presentation on our IR website
Beginning with Research
"On a combined basis, adjusted Research revenue grew 13% in the third quarter"
The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 69% or an 80 basis point decline compared to the third quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis
"This modest decline is primarily due to our newer-acquired businesses such as Capterra, SCM World and L2 having lower gross contribution margins than our traditional business"
I'll now focus on the traditional Gartner Research business
Adjusted revenues increased by 18% in the third quarter
"Acquisitions, primarily L2 and Machina Research, contributed to adjusted revenue growth in the quarter by less than 2 points"
We also had a roughly 1 point benefit from foreign exchange
"Our other metrics for the traditional Gartner Research business also remained very strong with 15% CV growth, accelerating sales productivity and improvements in our retention metrics"
"Total contract value was $2.063 billion as of the end of Q3. FX neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year, roughly in line with the growth we delivered last quarter"
"For reference in comparison, our Q3 2016 total contract value at current year FX rates was $1.790 billion"
"On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for the traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also consistent with the growth we delivered last quarter"
We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business
"From a traditional Gartner Research perspective, client retention was 83%, up 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 and flat on a sequential basis"
"Wallet retention ended at 104% for the quarter, up by 80 basis points year-on-year and roughly flat on a sequential basis"
Both retention figures are close to our all-time highs
"New business growth for traditional Gartner Research remained strong, up 11% year-on-year in Q3. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades through existing clients"
"And as always, we also benefit from our annual price increases"
Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises
"We ended the third quarter with 11,338 enterprise clients, up 6% compared to Q3 2016. The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow"
"It now stands at $182,000 per enterprise, up 8% versus prior year on an FX-neutral basis"
This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CEB growth through both new and existing enterprises
"Turning to sales productivity for the traditional Gartner Research sales force, over the last rolling four quarters, we delivered $272 million of FX-neutral net contract value"
"When divided by our beginning-of-period head count, which was 2,331 quota-bearing heads, our rolling four-quarter productivity per account executive was $117,000. Excluding the impact of the L2 acquisition, sales productivity was up 11% year-on-year and 1% sequentially"
"As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity"
"We remain confident that the initiatives around recruiting, training and tools that we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long term"
"Turning to the performance of CEB research in the quarter, CEB adjusted research revenues were flat year-on-year in Q3, a modest improvement from the year-on-year decline in Q2. We saw many positives with CEB's other research metrics in the quarter despite a modest decline in contract value"
"We ended Q3 with $571 million of traditional CEB research CV, down 1% on a year-over-year basis"
"In addition, wallet retention, also using Gartner's methodology, ended the quarter at 93%, roughly flat compared to the year-ago quarter"
"While retention rates continue to show improvement, we did see a slowdown in new business as we implemented a number of Gartner best practices around pricing and contract terms"
We also introduced a host of new seat-based products
"As we alluded to last quarter, we believe there would be speed bumps along the way as we integrated the CEB and Gartner businesses"
We are confident these impacts are temporary and that the actions we are taking position us well to drive growth and value in the future
"Moving to Events, on a combined basis, adjusted Events revenues increased by 25% year-on-year in Q3. Events' third quarter adjusted gross contribution margin was 36%, up by approximately 40 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter"
CEB Events revenue increased 16% year-over-year in a seasonally low quarter for that business
"The traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter in Q3 with a 25% year-on-year increase in revenues, driven by an 18% increase in the same event revenues"
We continued to see strength in attendees reporting a 21% increase in same event attendees
Foreign exchange had a roughly 3-point benefit on our traditional Gartner Events reported revenues in the third quarter
"Turning to Consulting, third quarter Consulting revenues declined by 2% on a reported basis and declined 3% on an FX-neutral basis"
"In the labor-based business, revenues declined 1% versus Q3 of last year, while the contract optimization business was down 11%"
"On the labor-based side, global head count of 682 was up 8% and we had 134 managing partners at the end of Q3, a 17% increase over the year-ago quarter"
"Broadly speaking, the MP strategy is working"
"As Gene described, we've experienced some operational challenges related to managing partner productivity on two teams"
"We'll be temporarily slowing down our MP growth on those two teams, so that we can focus on improving productivity"
"Once we see signs of improvement, we'll look again at increasing capacity on those teams"
"Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business ended the quarter at $91 million, up 2% year-on-year"
Our bookings performance strengthened in September and our Q4 pipeline looks strong as well
"Consulting gross contribution margin decreased by 230 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to modest softness in the contract optimization business and a slight decline in utilization"
"Turning to Talent Assessment & Other, adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 4% compared to the year-ago quarter"
This was consistent with the recent trends of our TA business
Both bookings and revenues have been impacted by a combination of a large number of open territories that existed at the time of the acquisition and the mix of lower tenured sales people as we filled those open territories
"As we discussed on our last call, we also established TA as a standalone business"
This caused some short-term disruptions that we feel are now behind us
"As Gene mentioned in early October, we decided to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives for the CEB Talent Assessment business, formerly known as SHL"
This business makes up around two-thirds of the TA & Other segment and approximately 5% of total Gartner company adjusted revenues
We are less than one month into the process and I'm pleased to report that it is progressing well
We will provide further updates as and when appropriate
"Moving down the income statement, on a combined basis, SG&A increased by 13% year-over-year in the third quarter"
FX had a roughly 1 point impact on the growth rate
"Our sales force continues to be our largest investment and as of the end of the third quarter, the traditional Gartner business had 2,716 quota-bearing sales associates"
This is an increase of 385 or 17% from a year ago
"While this is an acceleration from prior quarters, the increase is primarily due to the fact that we were able to reduce the level of open territories in the quarter, which should help us in Q4 and subsequent quarters as well"
The acquisition of CEB adds more than 500 frontline quota-bearing research sales associates
We've been focused on filling open head count and are beginning to grow sales head count
"We will leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity"
"As a growth company and now as a much larger growth company, we continue to invest in areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long term"
"At the same time, we continue to make good progress on cost synergies related to the CEB acquisition, specifically in the G&A functions"
"Through the investments we've already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect modest net synergy flow-through in 2017. We continue to work the cost synergy side of the equation and we'll report back on our progress in subsequent quarters"
"Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $149 million, which is essentially flat on a combined year-over-year basis"
"This result is driven by growth for traditional Gartner EBITDA, offset by year-over-year decline to traditional CEB EBITDA"
"Moving down the income statement, depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significantly, again related to the transaction"
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%
"Adjusting for acquisition and non-recurring charges, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.3%"
The lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate impacted our Q3 adjusted EPS by about $0.05. The lower rate resulted largely from the timing of certain tax costs
We expect our full-year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% to 34% and approximately 31% to 32% on an adjusted basis
GAAP diluted earnings per share was negative $0.53 in the third quarter
Our GAAP EPS figure also includes $1.18 of non-GAAP adjustments
"Therefore on an adjusted basis, our EPS in Q3 was $0.65 or $0.13 above the high-end of our guidance range"
There are three primary reasons for our EPS beat in the quarter
"First, EBITDA performance was better than forecasted"
This contributed approximately $0.04 of upside
"Second, below EBITDA, we have lower-than-forecasted depreciation as a result of purchase accounting adjustments as well as other incentive credits, which weren't forecasted"
These two items contributed about $0.04 of upside
"And third, our lower tax rate, as I just discussed, impacted our quarterly earnings per share by approximately $0.05. Turning now to cash, in Q3, operating cash flow was $150 million compared to $120 million for standalone Gartner in the year-ago quarter"
Our combined operating cash flow increased 16% year-over-year
"It is also important to note that our Q3 operating cash flow includes significant acquisition and integration payments, which we adjust out for our free cash flow calculation"
"Pivoting to free cash flow, Q3 2017 CapEx was $34 million and Q3 cash acquisition and integration payments were approximately $29 million"
"This yields Q3 free cash flow of $144 million, approximately 14% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q3 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong Research results from March Q2 and across Q3 have begun converting to free cash flow"
"Turning to the balance sheet, relative to the approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt we had as of April 5, we have repaid around $245 million by the end of Q3 with a quarter-ending gross debt level of approximately $3.4 billion"
"From a net debt perspective, we had less than $2.8 billion at the end of Q3, which translates to approximately 4 times leverage on a combined last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA"
"Given the favorable cash flow characteristics of the combined company, we remained firmly on schedule to delever to approximately 3 times gross leverage within the first two to three years of closing the acquisition"
"Turning now to guidance, slide 13 of the presentation provides you with our updated outlook for 2017. As is our practice, our EPS guidance is on both a GAAP and adjusted basis"
"On a high level, we've modestly increased our adjusted revenue outlook and tightened our outlook for the full-year adjusted EBITDA and cash flow"
"At the same time, we've increased our EPS outlook on an adjusted EPS basis"
And I'll also remind you that our full-year guidance includes 12 months of Gartner plus 9 months of CEB results
"Starting with revenue, for 2017, we expect combined company adjusted revenue of approximately $3.5 billion"
This is comprised of the following
"For Research, we expect combined adjusted revenues of between $2.6 billion and $2.625 billion"
"For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported"
"For Consulting, we expect revenues of between $320 million and $335 million"
"For Events, we expect the adjusted revenues of between $330 million and $345 million"
"For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $210 million and $225 million"
"Again, these are adjusted revenue ranges"
You will find the reconciliation of our adjusted revenue guidance ranges to GAAP revenue on slide 14 of the presentation
"Turning to adjusted EBITDA, as mentioned, we have narrowed our expected adjusted EBITDA range for 2017, trimming the high-end of our previous guidance range by $10 million"
"This modest reduction to the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by a few dynamics, the most notable of which relates to continued challenges in the TA business"
"As both Gene and I discussed earlier, the situation is getting markedly better as we fill open territories, but those improvements will not have an impact on the Q4 P&L"
"As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature"
Slide 15 of the presentation reconciles the per share difference between our updated GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges
We now expect the after-tax impact of these adjustments to total approximately $4.20 at the midpoint of our guidance
"Putting this all together, we now expect full-year 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.39 and $3.50 per share, which is a $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance"
Slide 17 details the key assumptions below EBITDA that we have used to calculate our updated adjusted EPS outlook
"For our tax rate, we project an annual effective rate for GAAP of approximately 33% to 34% and for adjusted earnings of approximately 31% to 32%"
"In addition, our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards as well as the timing of certain items"
"Finally, our EPS guidance is based on weighted average fully diluted share count of approximately 89.9 million to 90.5 million shares for the full-year 2017. Before concluding, I'd like to provide a little more color around our fourth quarter outlook"
"As you know, the fourth quarter is our seasonally largest quarter"
It's our largest Events and Consulting quarter
"I'll also remind you that during the fourth quarter of 2016, we had some softness in both our Events and Consulting businesses"
"As we have rolled into the fourth quarter of 2017, we have great momentum in the traditional Gartner Research business and our NCVI performance through 2017 flows into the P&L"
"We also had easier compares for both the Events and Consulting businesses, and that flows through as well"
"We are expecting to finish Q4 in the year strongly, consistent with our performance through the first three quarters of 2017. In closing, we've continued our strong 2017 performance through the third quarter"
Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%
"We also saw acceleration in sales productivity, and our retention metrics are near all-time highs"
"Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, and the adjustments we are making in Consulting should position us strongly for the future"
We are running a process to explore strategic alternatives for the Talent Assessment business and look forward to reporting back to you as that progresses
The traditional Gartner business is performing very well
The addition of CEB further strengthens our ability to capture the vast market opportunity ahead of us as we are now able to address the mission critical priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide
"As Gene mentioned, the integration is going exceptionally well"
"We set aggressive timelines, and we are achieving or beating them"
"As discussed last quarter, this has given us the confidence to accelerate a number of investments, such as growing the CEB sales force to accelerate our ability to capture the vast market opportunity that exists"
We've done all of that while driving acceleration of performance in the traditional Gartner business
"Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions"
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
"And, Tim, it's Craig"
"The one other thing I'd mention is we talked about this last quarter too, we've really only been in the market with the new seat-based products for a very short period of time"
"And so, it's too early to give full market color or market feedback"
"What we can say is we've actually had sales in each and every one of those new seat-based products and again to Gene's point, in looking at pipeline and activity, those things look fairly favorable as well"
A little over 500.
"And I think, Tim, just to add to that point, the same can be said on the traditional Gartner sell side as well, where we filled more open territories than we've historically done"
"In fact, we're probably – we're at historical low levels of open territories, which is a positive"
"And again, that should start flowing through or gives us a bigger army, if you will, as we head into the fourth quarter, but most notably as we head into 2018."
"And the other thing I'd add, Gary, good morning, is fundamentally the new seat-based products, because they do leverage best of both research from the traditional CEB side and from a traditional Gartner side and because they are seat-based products sold to a specific individual and then servicing a specific individual are, by their very nature, higher value products"
"And so, what we're doing is transforming the way that the CEB sales force has sold, but they are selling what we believe to be a significantly higher value product over the long term as well"
"So, I mean the other thing I'd just add on Gene's point is on the 80, we are – that is not 80 in one area, one function"
"So, it's actually spread out across the various functional sales teams that we have selling on the business side"
"So, I think HR, finance, marketing, et cetera and it's also distributed geographically as well"
"So, it sounds like a big number in terms of the absolute growth rate, but again like we do on the Gartner side, we are managing it, so that it's not wildly disruptive in terms of our go-to-market and selling processes for next year"
"And, Jeff, the second part of your question, just remind me again"
Yeah
"So, I mean, the way to think about that is on the Gartner side, we've been focused on adding in areas where we are doing the best and obviously slowing down in areas that are a little more challenged"
"The good news is, as our average productivity has shown improvement for the last couple of quarters, that gives us the confidence in more areas quite frankly"
"And again, we do expect given that we've seen this increase in the second half of 2017, they are in territory and they will be selling in Q4 and obviously they're in their first year"
"But as they progress in their tenure, you can look to see nice improvements over time in their overall productivity"
"We're not at a point yet where we're giving 2018 guidance, but I do think the way to think about it, particularly on the traditional Gartner side is, we will enter 2018 at current course and speed with a larger army and we are very focused on driving the productivity of that army as we head into 2018."
"Anj, I think the other thing I'd add is we talked about this last quarter, and we talked about it, again, this quarter"
These are absolutely the right things to do to support and drive future sustained growth
"And, I think what we're seeing in terms of dislocation or impact is kind of noisy a little bit in terms of the overall results"
"Again, with all these changes, as Gene mentioned earlier, CEB contract value is still kind of on-trend to what its performance had been prior to the acquisition, while we're getting ourselves ready to actually tune up the machine and drive growth into the future"
"So, we're 100% committed that these are the right things to do"
"Again, we've done it on the Gartner side historically"
We've run the same kind of plays when we've done other similar type of acquisitions that had similar business characteristics to what we've inherited or what we acquired from the CEB deal
"And so, again, we're thinking about this around laying the foundation for future growth and, again, having seat-based products, having them with the right kind of contract terms, having them with pricing discipline are all the right things to do as we head into the future"
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
That's great color
"A quick one on EBITDA, the change there, I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly"
Is that entirely being driven by the softer TA outlook or is there some impact from the core CEB business performance or your higher sales force head count at Gartner?
"It's a great question, Anj"
What's happening there is predominantly related to the TA business
"As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a number of dynamics happening in there"
Some significantly smaller and going in both directions quite frankly
"Really, probably I'd highlight one other specific item, which we alluded to in our Consulting comments, is we are still seeing a little bit of a productivity lag"
And that obviously we can only burn the revenue that we have in backlog
"And while we did see some nice uptick or uptick rather in the backlog position from Q2 to Q3, we're still not exactly where we'd love to be on those two teams"
"And so, there is a little bit of a drag related to the EBITDA adjustment from Consulting"
"But, again, the way to think about it is it's predominantly related to the continued trends on a TA business, and there's a variety of other little or smaller puts and takes in there as well"
Anjaneya K
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
"And, Mike, fundamentally, our reason for being in the Events business is to provide that amazing experience for the end-users"
And Joe was at our Orlando event and many of you on the call were at our Orlando event as well
That's the kind of experience that we want to provide to all of our attendees that go to our events across the entire portfolio
"And it's just a great opportunity for, as Gene mentioned, Gartner seat holders to go and actually experience the research live and for non-Gartner seat holders to go and experience the research live"
And the reason that they're willing to carve out a couple days of their busy schedules and buying a ticket is because they get so much value at that event
Yeah
"So, the way to think about it is we're organized by geography and practice and some are organized just by geography and some places, where we're larger, we're organized by a combination of region or geography and practice"
What I'd say is we talked about two specific teams here
It's out of several across the entire Consulting organization
"So, as Gene mentioned in his comments, and I think I did as well, broadly speaking, the Consulting business is performing well"
"We're driving very strong managing partner productivity, broadly speaking again, across the business"
We have two pockets of challenges
Gene described in detail the specific challenges for each of those teams
"We are working them, and we expect to have those things in much better shape as we roll into 2018."
"Yeah, Hamzah, it's Craig"
"Just to add to that, I think your observation around lack of or limited investment is 100% spot on"
"And that's probably true across a number of other areas of the business, but particularly on the sales side, but again, what we need to do, given the fact that we are implementing so much change, again we have to manage how much change and disruption teams can handle at one time"
"And again what we've done and we've learned this through experience on our own side is you have to find that right balance and the additional 80 right now in terms of that, first foray of significant growth, coupled with all the other operational change we're implementing is what we believe to be the right balance right now"
"If we are performing better, we'll figure out how to go faster"
"If it's not going to plan, we'll figure out how to tweak it to make it go faster"
But think of this as kind of foray one in terms of injecting growth and investment into supporting longer-term sustainable growth for the CEB contract value business
"And the one difference we generally have on the managing partner side as compared to the research sell side is a portion of our managing partners, our promotions is from within"
"And so, in those cases, while their ""more junior"" from managing partner perspective, they know Gartner, they know our capabilities, they have relationships with Gartner clients, et cetera"
"So, those, while generally smaller numbers, tend to ramp up to productivity a little bit more quickly than people coming from the outside"
"So, we have a mix and again it varies by region"
"So, there's really no answer around how much is promotion versus how much is hired externally, but we are dealing with those two populations as we grow our managing partner capacity"
"And, Toni, the one thing I'd say from a product perspective, and this is sort of the beauty of the Gartner product portfolio, is you're buying an annual subscription and you have access to all that security content when you need it"
"But tomorrow, the issue might not be security, it might be moving to the cloud or it might be digitalizing your business"
"And so, again, we're not generally speaking of consulting organization, where we're going in with spot solutions"
"We do have a consulting team that actually does help with those kinds of things, but our research business, again, which is three quarters of our overall business, it's really about selling the annual subscription and giving our clients the view that the value proposition is broad and deep when they need it"
"And so, when security is a big deal, they have access to that security stuff"
"When cloud is a big deal for them, they have access to the cloud stuff"
"It certainly doesn't hurt as a conversation starter around, hey, you read about the Equifax breach last night or last week, rather, we have great stuff that can actually help you out, that's absolutely true"
"But, again, the beauty of our products and offerings are it's a 12-month subscription with access to everything when you want it and on demand"
"Toni, it's Craig"
I think it's absolutely the latter as you just described it
"Just to put it in perspective, Q3 generally is a pretty small quarter for our contract optimization business"
"So, about a 11% down was worth roughly $1 million"
"And on a year-to-date basis, our contract optimization business is actually up nicely year-over-year"
"So, it was a little bit of a blip in Q3, nothing we'd say or see from a trend perspective, in fact probably opposite, given on a year-to-date basis that we are performing better than last year comparably"
"Yeah, Toni"
It was a pretty modest increase on a very large number
I think two things there
One is the traditional Gartner Research performance has improved consistently over the course of this year
"Yeah, so we saw acceleration from Q1 to Q2 up to 15% growth"
"We stated 15% growth in Q3. And that, as we talked about a little bit, as we described our Q4 guidance, that is flowing through"
That's the bulk of it
"As always, we're adjusting for latest foreign exchange rates and things like that"
"And so, there's a little bit of modest tweaking on each of the revenue lines, but from a research perspective, it's really predominantly driven by our year-to-date NCVI performance on the traditional Gartner business"
