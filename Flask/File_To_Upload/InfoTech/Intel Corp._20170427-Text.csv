"Thanks, Brian"
2016 was a record year for Intel and 2017 is off to a strong start
We executed on several important milestones in the quarter
"We delivered on innovative product and technology roadmaps across the business, Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp, and Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group"
"Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year"
"Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year over year, and earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year over year"
Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion
"First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year over year, and gross margin came in at 63% up 0.5 points year over year"
"Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year over year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program"
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance
"The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year over year"
We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels
Client ASPs were up 7% year over year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong
"This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the Client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations"
"The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year over year"
"The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year over year"
"Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A costs, higher product costs as we transition to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products"
"Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year over year driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business"
"Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year over year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending"
"Our Memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year over year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply"
We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations
"This segment had an operating loss of $129 million, largely driven by costs associated with 3D XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity"
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million
"Operating profit was $92 million, flat year over year after adjusting for acquisition related impacts"
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million and operating profit was $95 million
Consistent with our prior guidance the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter
Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress
"First, invest in our business, second, strategic acquisitions and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks"
In the quarter we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations
"We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock"
"In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interests in ASML, which generated $235 million of pre-tax gains"
"At quarter end, cash other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million"
Total debt was $25.8 billion
Today we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 billion
"Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization"
We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time
Now let me turn to guidance
"First, some context"
"First, while we see strong momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third party analysts"
"We feel great about our annual cadence of product innovations with new product launches planned this year including Skylake for data center, eighth generation core, 64-tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line"
"Second, we continued to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels"
"Third, the Data Center business has solid momentum with the mid-summer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor"
"And forth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group"
We expect to realize a pre-tax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million
This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter
"And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company and we are making an important commitment to our owners today"
We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017 and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time
"We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue which we expect to reach no later than 2020. As a result, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share"
"As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year over year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security"
"We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year over year, gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63% and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year over year"
"We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year, as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company"
"We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year over year"
We feel pretty good about where we are 90 days into our three-year journey
We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit expectations for the full year
"At the same time, we are investing in the future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion"
"We are already seeing an impact, with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud"
"With that, let me turn it over to Mark"
"Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full-year revenue to be up $0.5 billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year"
Yes
"And I would just say that our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term"
"And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income"
"Against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term"
"So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the three-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward"
"Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter"
"As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively easy comp"
"So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are"
"Yes, I would, Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG"
"Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%"
"In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9 point drop in margins, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it'll be the first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer"
"As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation"
So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we allocate cost to the business segments
"I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year"
We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year
"As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margins from a seasonal perspective"
And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22 to 14 nanometer
So it's in line with our long-term expectations
No change
"Our outlook for 2017, no change"
"The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the Data Center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology"
It bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business
So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year
"Yeah, that's true, and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our improvement throughout the course of the year"
"Yeah, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year"
"Again, it will be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business"
"It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half"
"So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs"
"And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business"
"The lowest point Q1 expectations will grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full-year operating margins despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs at roughly 40% for the year"

"And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business"
And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year over year
"I guess what I'm trying to understand is, should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the Memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful"
There's two dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company
One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down
Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we've made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year
"And second, our R&D cost particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer goes up little bit"
"So during the course of the year, our overall cost will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses"
"And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically"
"And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue"
So that's all baked in
I don't know if it's rounding or not
"I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through at an additional $0.05 of EPS, so we feel great about that"
I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half
ASPs will improve for Data Center
"As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the Client business"
And the fast growth of Memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margins
"So I think when we take that altogether through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout to the course of the year"
"And Q1 was where we expected, Q2 consistent with Q1 and full year"
