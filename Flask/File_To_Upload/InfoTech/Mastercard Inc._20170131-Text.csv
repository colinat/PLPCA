"Thank you, Warren, and good morning everybody"
And this is Warren's first call and as you noticed in his first call he's made the first change of changing nomenclature from processed to switch
So welcome to the place
Our business continues to perform well
We're very pleased to have delivered a strong result for the year driven by solid execution of our strategy
"For the quarter, our net revenue growth was 10%, EPS growth 7% or 31% EPS when you normalize for taxes"
"And what those numbers mean for the full year of 2016 is we saw net revenue growth of 13% and EPS growth of 11%, or 19% when normalized for taxes"
We continue to see bright spots as well as some areas of concern in the global economy in the US
Post-election optimism remains relatively high
"Consumer confidence, unemployment, wages all seem to be holding steady"
It's still too early to tell what impact any new policy proposals might have on the US or other economies
"But like all of you, we're expecting to see initiatives around taxation, regulation, infrastructure spending and trade"
"And in fact on regulation, you've all seen the recent executive order talking about taking out two regulations for every one proposed"
"Turning to Europe, the economic recovery is persistent in many markets throughout the prior year, throughout 2016, led by Germany"
And the prospects for this coming year of 2017 seem encouraging as economic sentiment and unemployment continue to improve
The UK appears to be stable
"We're seeing continued growth in travel to the country as a result of the weaker pound, and it's going to take a few years obviously to work through the specifics of how Brexit is implemented"
"So, we remain watchful of the implications of that on the UK and broadly on the EU. In Asia, we remain cautious, largely as a result of the prolonged slowdown in China"
"In India, the government has recently implemented a plan to address its parallel economy and to help drive the shift from cash to electronic forms of payment"
"Given the heavy reliance on cash in that economy, this is expected to soften consumer spending in the short term, but could well fuel economic growth and modernize the payment system in the long term"
"In Australia, both consumer and business confidence remain weak"
While Brazil's economy appears to be emerging slowly from a deep recession
"The road to recovery for Brazil is expected to be long, as there is still political uncertainty"
"So with that as the backdrop, what are we doing is to continue to focus on executing our strategy and growing our business"
We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets
We're continuing to win deals by leveraging our service offerings
"On the legal front, we received positive news yesterday regarding the judgment on our case for ten retailers in the United Kingdom representing approximately 40% of our existing damages exposure"
"We're delighted that the UK court found that Mastercard's interchange fees do not restrict competition, and actually are necessary for the functioning of the payment system"
"So finally, on the legal side, still let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink"
"We've been working with the UK competition regulator to secure approval of the transaction, and we're really pleased as they have accepted in principle our proposed solution to address their one concern regarding the LINK ATM scheme"
And we're now looking forward to working with the regulator for final approval of that solution
"We expect to close the transaction sometime in the spring of 2017. So now, let's move on to a few highlights from 2016 and some of our recent business activity"
"Overall, 2016 was a year that had its economic and regulatory challenges, but I think we've navigated those successfully while putting significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital, in safety and security, in data analytics, loyalty and processing"
"This last quarter, we continued our momentum in the US, pleased to have renewed a number of deals including SunTrust Bank for their credit, debit and commercial business, which, by the way, includes Labs as a service to help drive their innovation agenda, as well as the First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private banks in the US, for their credit and commercial portfolios"
"In addition, we've given you several examples in the past as to how we've been extending our capabilities beyond switching into processing, back to Warren's clarification, enabling us to drive more deals and touch more transactions"
"This quarter, we've renewed agreements with USAA for debit card processing services and with Jack Henry & Associates to provide processing solutions for credit, debit and commercial to their more than 10,000 clients"
"Outside of the US, we're continuing to make significant progress as well"
"In Europe – I'm just giving you a few examples by the way – in Europe, we signed Amazon for their credit co-brand business in the UK, renewed our debit agreement with ABN AMRO, one of the largest banks in the Netherlands"
"In Latin America, we signed a new deal with Caixa in Brazil for credit and debit, which also includes Advisor services"
"Additionally, we renewed agreements with Bancolombia for credit and debit with a focus on affluent, as well as with Santander in Mexico for credit, debit and commercial, and a flip of their commercial business in Brazil, while in Asia we renewed our agreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the largest bank in that country"
"Finally, while discussing these, let me touch on the domestic opportunity for China"
"We continue to speak with the regulators there to better understand the entry requirements, and to clarify our options and how best to approach that market"
"In the meanwhile, what we're doing is focusing on driving single branded card issuance"
"We're pleased to add Bank of China this quarter, bringing the total number of programs for single branded card issuance launched in 2016 to 44, with more than 10 banks"
All of these are aimed at driving cross-border spend with the country's growing affluent segment
So let me move on to digital
"As we've often said, that this is a marathon not a sprint"
"But I believe we are executing well against our strategy, and have made some good progress in 2016, and starting at Masterpass, where we continue to focus on driving both user adoption and acceptance"
"We've talked to you about our Digital by Default strategy, which basically enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders through their online banking app, and helps to drive scale, but at the same time keeps the issuer at the center of their consumer relationship"
"We're pleased to have achieved our stated goal of enabling 80 million accounts by the end of 2016. The services have been rolled out globally with several banks, including Bank of America, Capital One, Citi, Nordea, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia"
"With a healthy pipeline to build on this momentum in 2017, we've also added five new Masterpass markets in 2016, bringing the total to 34. Last year, Masterpass became the first digital payment service to work across all devices and channels, which helped drive acceptance and enabled consumers to shop online, in-store, or in app using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice"
"So from an acceptance standpoint, we've added roughly 80,000 new merchants, bringing the total to about 340,000 for online and in-app purchases, as well as more than 6 million locations in about 80 countries that allow contactless payments"
"This quarter, we're pleased to announce partnerships with Dunkin' Donuts, Walgreens, Gulf Oil, Wyndham Hotels, and so on"
"Last quarter, we highlighted our agreement with the Ecobank Group to roll out Masterpass QR"
That's a mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries
"This quarter, we're building on that momentum"
"We've partnered with SnapScan, a mobile QR-based payment solution backed by Standard Bank in South Africa, as well as the Government of India and RBL Bank to add a combined 40,000 merchants who will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS terminal"
So let me move on to Mastercard Send
"This past year, we highlighted our partnership with Green Dot and Uber, Stripe and Lyft as well as Allstate, and how they are using the platform to make convenient and secure payments to drivers, delivery people, and claimants, among others"
"This quarter we added Wells Fargo Bank, who will leverage Mastercard Send for their treasury and merchant services customers"
So let's keep going a little bit with the partnerships in digital
"This past year, we helped Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay and Microsoft Wallet to expand to several new countries"
"We've added Spain, Ireland, Poland, Russia, and Hong Kong, bringing the total to 17 markets around the globe where consumers can use one or more of these services"
"We also enabled several of them to allow their consumers to shop online, in-app, and check out using their same MDES tokenized login credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where Masterpass is accepted"
"And by doing that, obviously this also benefited our merchant partners, as they did not have to do any additional development work to support these services"
"Finally, as part of the innovation agenda, we've been looking at ways to combine digital payments with artificial intelligence to create better and more personalized experiences for consumers"
"And to give you an example, this past year we launched an AI bot platform, which is similar to human interaction and enables consumers to buy products via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and check out using Masterpass"
"So building on that theme of AI, we've also launched Decision Intelligence, one of our safety and security products which uses machine learning to score transactions based on an individualized risk profile in order to reduce false declines, while at the same time mitigating potential fraud"
That brings me to services
"And remember, our focus on services is in delivering capabilities that connect right back to our core business, providing great value and competitive differentiation to our clients while giving us an incremental revenue stream"
I think we've made significant progress in this area in the prior year
"Still, let me quickly run through a few examples, starting with safety and security, which has been a key area of focus for us this past year"
"We continued the rollout of our leading biometric authentication product, Identity Check, fondly known as selfie pay, to 16 markets around the world, in addition to the launch of Decision Intelligence, which I just mentioned"
"On the data analytics front, since the acquisition of APT, we've integrated the sales and product organizations at APT with Advisors to drive significant benefits"
We've added more than 60 organizations who have subscribed to the APT platform in recurring subscription-based contracts
"So in addition to McDonald's, which we mentioned in the past, we got JCPenney and Duracell in the US, Asahi Breweries in Japan, Thomas Cook in the UK"
"In fact, there were 28 deals in total that were additive to APT's business as usual efforts"
"So with assets like these, we not only deliver great insight, we're actually building even stronger relationships with our merchant partners as well"
"So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics"
"Yes, I absolutely am"
"Remember that in the retail business alone, the consumer to retail payments, 85% of the world's retail payments are still cash and check"
"So, there's a lot of opportunity there, first; second, there's the whole commercial space that's got a great deal of opportunity that we've been assiduously building on; third, we've got our services revenue; and fourth, we've actually beginning to participate in the direct to bank account payments once the VocaLink acquisition is complete"
"So, to me, we're building the right portfolio to take on the opportunities that this secular growth represents over the next decade, not just one or two years"
"Who allowed you to ask that question, Tien-Tsin?"
It's nice to hear from you
"So, I think that it's early days to talk in great depth about what all could happen, but I'll tell you my views that are on the positive side of this, and then you can see, obviously, through the news that there are people who are concerned as well about the negative side of it"
"The positive side of it to me, his regulatory announcement, the fact that he seems genuinely concerned about the manner in which regulations enacted are creating millstones for business, both small and large, to grow in the U.S"
"I think that's pretty clear, and he is definitely committed to helping make it easier for businesses to open, operate and run profitably in the system"
"Now, what that means specifically for a company like ours, or for merchants or for banks who are in our ecosystem, I don't yet know, because you'll only get to know that over a period of time"
"My general belief is that, certainly, it'll help both of the other parties, the merchants and the banks, in the ecosystem in different ways"
They'll end up winning on some and losing on some
I just don't know which ones will go where
"I do know that in an environment which talks about regulation being something you need to watch carefully so that you enact the right kind of regulation, but you don't stifle innovation and growth, that could lead to definitely a constructive view"
That's kind of where I'm coming from
"I don't yet know, specifically, how it will impact our company or those in our immediate ecosystem"
"I do believe that in the space of infrastructure, there will be some form of investment or the other funded in some form or the other into infrastructure, both physical and digital, in our country"
I believe that will only increase the velocity of money in the country
"That will be helpful for a company like ours, both in retail and commercial payments"
"So, I look forward actually to that, both as a direct impact on our company, but also, frankly, traveling the way I do and the way most of you do, the infrastructure in our country could do with the benefit of a sustained investment program, both in physical and digital"
"So, I think that's important"
"The aspects of taxes, there's all kinds of discussions floating around about what kind of tax rate"
I'm talking corporate taxes right now
"What kind of corporate tax rates could come to if it comes down from the current level that we're paying, which as Martina told you, 28%, 29%"
"If it comes down to anything below that, you should expect us as a company to benefit from it directly to the bottom line"
There's rumors that it will go to 20% or 25%
You can put your own probability factor on which one
"I think there's lots of things to be worked out about how you pay for that reduction in taxes and what impact that has, border taxes, adjustments of import and export circumstances"
All of these have implications for us as a company
"Mostly we are a net exporter of service rather than a net importer of service as a company, because of the fact that so much of our back office and our technology and our product development has historically been developed in the United States with US IP"
We do have a lot overseas
We do have stuff in Asia
"We do have stuff in Dublin and Europe, but net, I think you will find us to be a net exporter rather than a net importer"
"So I guess on all of those aspects on taxes to regulatory to infrastructure, I can find ourselves finding this to be net positive for our company over the next four to five years"
"The aspects of trade, Tien-Tsin, as you know, my normal approach to trade is that I continue to believe that the United States is way too large a marketplace for companies and businesses to feel that they shouldn't be involved with having on-soil presence and on-soil activity and frequent travel in and out by business executives alike"
"So, I consider the US to be too attractive for that to change dramatically"
"I do believe like everybody else that in the corporate world, there are a lot of us have built our business on the freer flow of cross-border trade, data and people"
"If that were to change over time, that would be a problem, but I don't believe that that's what the administration wants to do"
They want to grow the economy
The economy is not going to grow without the right inputs in the right places
"It may change specifics of the way trade gets enacted, but I continue to be relatively bullish on where this economy could go over the next four to five years"
"Don't ask questions again, man"
"So, the interchange changes have already gone, and as you know, some time back, and so have all the other rules that went with it, including the co-badging"
And that's why there's an Article 8 and Article 7 implications
"They're all baked into our earnings calls for the last two, three quarters"
"First of all, I actually am beginning to see an expansion in acceptance, for sure, across the EU, probably facilitated by the lower interchange rates that merchant who earlier were reluctant to accept electronic payments are now willing to do so"
That's a good thing
There is obviously an impact on bank P&Ls caused by the lower interchange rates
"Every bank, as you know, is working on other ways to find ways to get to their P&L again"
That includes fees
It includes services
It includes alternative products
It includes an emphasis on commercial in some cases
There's a whole series of actions that banks in different countries across Europe have been taking to try and find a way to put some energy back into their P&L
"My sense on the other aspects, PSD2, as you know, it's still two or three years away from fully being implemented"
2018 is when it starts hitting the road
But there's a lot of energy and a lot of passion going into preparing for it
I actually believe that VocaLink could play a very instrumental role for banks in the EU to help them actually find a way to navigate through PSD2 and to maintain scheme-like look and feel to the ability to create payments in a way that they can manage through their customer relationships and their chargebacks and their fraud management and the like
"So, I believe that to be an essential part of our strategy for Europe"
"On the Visa, Visa European competitive environment, honestly, it's still very early days"
They've just about closed
"As you know, they're going through their own adjustments across the world on catering for that acquisition"
"We're in the marketplace, looking at what anything happens in the market on either pricing, in which case we may have some opportunity, or on volume growth and share growth, which we continue to pursue and we're continuing to win some deals in Europe"
"So, it's kind of early days"
We're in the game
"So, I continue to believe that the entire services space, remember, there's a set of different businesses inside it"
"So, there's safety and security, there's Advisors in the consulting business"
There's the information services and data analytical space
"There's the space of loyalty and rewards and there's processing, which actually allows us to get a role to play in many of the other services we want to be participating in"
They've all got different growth rates and trajectories
"Safety and security happens to be one of the fastest growing, along with information and data analytics"
"That's because one, they're intertwined, but two, that's a very important topic right now for consumers, merchants and banks"
"And I believe we have cutting-edge products that are differentiated and are capable of helping institutions across the world plug in and help them manage potential fraud while work on declines, and so help them really maximize their P&L in attractive ways when they're looking for revenue"
"So, I continue to believe those two will be very attractive growth areas over the next five to ten years"
"Our processing grows when we win deals, but processing, and when we get into more footprints, processing tends to be a very local business"
"It has some global transferability, but it tends to be quite local"
"And therefore, it tends to have also a different margin profile than safety and security and information analytics because local means you've got to build locally and that creates its own expense profile"
We also tend to make more money out of the transactions we see rather than in the processing business itself
"So, it tends to be a input into deal winning rather than part of the revenue cycle as much as the others"
The loyalty business is actually very interesting
We started with a relatively good platform in MasterCard Rewards
We've added to it over the years with merchant funded rewards by buying into Truaxis in California and buying into Pinpoint in Australia
We're actually getting some nice wins in that space and we continue to believe that the loyalty and rewards space will be a good growth area and a good sticky area with our customers
"So, do I see this as being a relatively attractive growth area, a faster percentage of growth than our core business? Probably, because it's off a smaller base as well"
"Do I see this changing dramatically over the next couple of years? No, but beyond that, we'll see"
This is a live area
"We're investing in it both organically and inorganically, so it's kind of a live growing segment for us"
"And those PIN transactions go up and down, as we've told you a few times"
There's months and quarters when they are growing faster
"That tends to be a more, it's almost a weekly and daily issue that we deal with"
"But, if you're talking about generally long-term trends, you should expect that the two will grow faster than the other two"
"The fact is that even at 8% or 10%, core payment transaction growth of 8% or 10% is attractive"
That reflects the secular change as well as all the day-to-day activities that Martina just referred to
"Well, there have been for years in the industry these alternative payment schemes to the global networks"
"In fact, I used to say that our competition is not just the global networks"
"And of course, it's not just cash that we've been talking about for a while, but it's also these local payment schemes country by country"
Europe had a number of them
Mexico has them
Canada had them
Australia has them
Russia now has it post the sanctions in the Crimean circumstances
India has launched RuPay and UID
"China's always had one, called China UnionPay, which kind of most people know lots about"
"And so, in every marketplace there have been these schemes"
"These schemes are either owned by the local banks or by governments in some cases, so CUP is owned by the Chinese government, whereas a lot of the other schemes are owned by local bank associations"
"Cartes Bancaires in France, for example, is owned by the French banks"
They play different roles
They play roles where they will look at all the debit transactions locally
"Others, like CUP, all domestic transactions are mandated to go through them, and so on"
"So, there's a whole range of these"
"What we've been trying to do is to go back into marketplaces that we believe that the existence of these schemes is, one, either creating an imbalance in the market or holding back growth, and attempt to either work with the government or the banks to find ways to either partner with those schemes or find ways to change the laws around those schemes so that you can have a more open marketplace, which should benefit merchants and should benefit banks and should benefit consumers"
And we've had different degrees of success over the years
"The European Union, as you know, through its directives over the years in PSD and – what is it called, the other one? The European Special?"
"I get mixed up between SEPA and SIPA (51:07); but, SEPA"
Those have created opening up of these schemes for people like us to be able to play
I continue to believe that the model will be a mix of all of those
"The one you're specifically getting at is more like the Russian model, where there is a domestic payment scheme generated and created, and we have helped them put their technology together and connect with them and provide services that are value added from safety, security, cross-border approvals, transaction management to information and data, which are provided by our better capable systems than they have of their own"
And the fact that we see global transactions and they tend to see localized transactions adds a long-term value differentiator between what we can provide and what a local scheme can provide
It's the same with the RuPays of the world or others
"We're always looking for ways to cooperate with them, in some cases successfully, in others not so"
I'm sorry it's not a clear answer because this is not a clear space
It's a space that evolves and breathes and lives every day and week depending on the circumstances of a marketplace
"And you should just know that our country managers on the ground have this as one of the major objectives in their evaluations, and the decisions in how they get paid"
"Well, in China right now there's nothing to say because we are still waiting for clarity on how we could be partners domestically in China"
"Having said that, we have had a relationship with Alipay and Alibaba for the last couple of years on helping them think through how to use our technology to figure out different aspects of their own service, including the detection of fraud products on their website"
Some of that relationship has worked well
"Some of it, it depends on the energy on both sides of the partnership to implement that"
"I consider different forms of payment to all be competitive, but also conducive to the bigger challenge of fighting the 85% that is still cash and check in retail payments; and that's always been my stance and I haven't changed"
"So, I've had the same view of PayPal"
I have the same view of Alipay
"I have the same view of all of these, that I think there's enough place in this market for all of us to play, and there's enough, let's say, challenges in the marketplace for all of us to put our shoulders to it"
We've come at it differently
We'll win some deals; we'll lose some deals
But I kind of believe there's enough secular growth opportunity in this space for a lot of us to flourish
Sure
"So, India has only 1.4 million terminals actually at the point of sale, and it tends to be a very cash dominated market"
I'd say 95%-plus of the transactions in retail are cash
"When the demonetization happened, the two biggest currency notes were taken out of circulation, the INR 500 and the INR 1,000 notes constituted 86% of the currency notes in circulation"
That's the shock that is referred to as what could lower consumer spending for a couple of quarters
We saw that because restrictions in cash withdrawal from banks and from ATMs were instituted as the government tried to catch up with the demand for cash
"With the new notes, they were printing, those notes had to be put into the market"
The ATMs had to be redesigned
Their hoppers had to be redone
"Or you can just imagine the level of work in a country where the largest public sector bank has 18,000 branches, and is spread across a relatively large country"
"So, that's what caused some of the dislocation"
"Now, 1.4 million merchant terminals"
"Their point of sale payments can take this, but behavior habits that used those terminals very infrequently"
The 75% increase in purchase volume you're seeing is because people began to use their cards more frequently at those very same point of sales terminals
"What's going on now is a concerted move to increase the number of point of sales terminals, double plus over the next I'd say three to six months"
"That work is being done by the acquirers, the banks, the networks, us, Visa, others, but also by the government actively pushing that logic"
"Second, there's a great deal of partnership with merchant organizations on the ground"
The Confederation of All India Traders estimates that there's as many as 60 million casual and regular merchants in India
"Even if you were to go from 1.4 million terminals to 5 million acceptance points in the next two years, we're talking 5 million out 60 million"
"So, there's a long way to go before we get to a ubiquitous terminal acceptance model"
There's a lot of work going on on cheaper terminals
QR codes is an example of almost zero cost for terminals for a merchant
We are actively rolling them out
You heard that in my prepared remarks with the Government of India and with RBL and others of that type
"We're working actively with issuers, acquirers and the government in short on this topic, but don't expect this to change in a quarter or a month"
"It is a long fight, and I think the Prime Minister is to be credited for his willingness to take it on, because in the medium to long term, this could be transformative for the way India's economy operates in the recognizable formal economy, as compared to the informal economy, where it's denied taxation and denied credit and denied insurance"
I think he's really trying to do something pretty brave here
That's Europeans traveling within Europe
That's basically what's going on
Europeans are staying closer to home
The UK is interesting
Inbound into the UK is up substantially
Outbound from the UK is negative
"Not just down, negative, substantially"
That's because of what happened to the pound versus other currencies
"So, it's kind of a mixed bag across the range"
"Thank you all for your questions, and Tien-Tsin, special thanks to you, buddy"
I'll leave you with a couple of closing thoughts
We had a strong year in 2016. Our financial performance was driven by the growth for our core business and our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves with services
That led to significant business wins this year
"As I just said in some of the Q&A, the secular growth opportunity in our business remains very strong"
India is just a great recent example of this
The actions taken there has the potential to be transformative
We will continue to invest for that future
"We're going to shape the payments landscape through innovation and expand into new payment flows, hence the interest in VocaLink and other such efforts, to ensure that we are well positioned for success for many more years to come"
"Obviously, in terms of what this means for 2017, we're going to remain focused on growing our business by driving the shift from cash to electronic payment, by building new service offerings, by advancing our digital strategy, and hopefully closing in the spring on our acquisition of VocaLink, all this while Martina ensures that we all very carefully manage our expenses"
"So, we appreciate the continued support of the company and thank you for joining us today"
