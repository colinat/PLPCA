"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone"
I want to reiterate that my commentary reflects our performance inclusive of approximately three weeks of LinkedIn results
"For this quarter only, I will comment on our results excluding LinkedIn for consistency with the guidance provided last quarter"
I encourage you to reference our earnings slides for supplemental information
"Our second quarter revenue was $26.1 billion, up 2% and 4% in constant currency"
"Gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency"
Operating income grew 5% or 8% in constant currency
"And earnings per share were $0.83, an increase of 9% and 13% in constant currency"
"Excluding LinkedIn, our second quarter revenue was $25.8 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency"
Gross margin increased 3% and 4% in constant currency
Operating income grew 8% and 11% in constant currency
"And our EPS was $0.84, increasing 11% and 15% in constant currency"
Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter
"From a geographic perspective, our results were largely in line with macroeconomic trends, with additional benefit from a healthier PC market, particularly in the commercial segment"
"Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year over year to 84%, even with better than expected transactional revenue performance"
Commercial bookings increased 7% or 12% in constant currency
"Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $21.1 billion, growing 8% and 9% in constant currency, even with an FX headwind of approximately $150 million due to the strengthening U.S"
dollar through the quarter
"And our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high, exceeding $28 billion"
"Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%"
"Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48%, up 2 points from last year, largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage"
"And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud"
We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year
"Now to company gross margin, gross margin was approximately 62% inclusive of LinkedIn, up slightly from the prior year"
"This quarter, the strengthening of the U.S"
dollar relative to major currencies created additional negative FX impact on total and segment level revenue
"On total revenue, FX had a 2-point negative impact, a point more than expected, with no additional impact from LinkedIn"
"In both Productivity and Business Processes and the Intelligent Cloud segments, the FX impact was 2 points, 1 point more than expected"
"And in More Personal Computing, FX had a 1-point impact, in line with expectations"
Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency
"Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency"
Operating expenses were under our guidance range primarily due to a favorable one-time legal settlement and FX benefits
Now let's turn to each segment
"This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10% and 12% in constant currency to $7.4 billion"
"In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 7% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business"
"Office 365 Commercial revenue increased by 47% or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of install base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion"
"We also continued to see higher than expected results from our transactional business, in part due to an improving commercial PC market"
"Office Consumer revenue grew 22% or 21% in constant currency, as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue"
"In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period"
"Our Dynamics business grew 7%, up 9% in constant currency, and our Dynamics 365 install base more than doubled"
LinkedIn revenue for the three-week period from December 8 to the end of the quarter was $228 million
"Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly a point of impact from LinkedIn"
"Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition"
Operating income declined slightly but was up 1% in constant currency and up 7% in constant currency excluding LinkedIn
"The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion of revenue, growing 8% and 10% in constant currency"
"Server products and cloud services grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth"
"Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher than expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth declined this quarter 4% and 2% in constant currency due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements"
Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency
"And segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower Enterprise Services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin"
"We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement"
Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency
"Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger than expected performance from our Windows business"
"Overall, revenue declined 5% and 4% in constant currency"
Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter
"OEM Pro grew 6%, better than we anticipated, driven by an improving commercial PC market and enterprise demand for Windows 10. OEM non-Pro grew 5%, ahead of the consumer PC market, as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category"
Inventory levels remain normal
"Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and install base expansion"
"Patent licensing declined this quarter, driven by lower unit volume and revenue per unit"
"Our search business ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with improving profitability and continued growth in Bing from higher revenue per search and search volume"
"In our devices business, revenue declined 35%, down 34% in constant currency"
"Phone revenue declined 81%, and we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter"
"Surface revenue was down 2% and flat in constant currency, as we continued to phase out the Surface 3 device"
"Importantly, Surface gross margin dollars grew 6% and 17% in constant currency from an increasing mix of Pro 4 and Book replacing Surface 3 in the portfolio"
"In gaming, revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency due to lower console hardware pricing and Xbox 360 volumes"
"In this holiday quarter, as Satya mentioned, we reached an all-time high of active Xbox Live users, which helped to drive our gaming software and services revenue to 18% and 21% growth in constant currency"
This marks our first $1 billion quarter of digital transactions for our gaming business through our Universal Store across Windows 10 and Xbox One
Segment gross margin percentage and dollars both increased this quarter
"Gross margin dollars grew 3% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage expanded with the continued shift to higher-margin products and services"
"Operating expenses declined by 12%, also 12% in constant currency, from lower phone expense, a one-time legal settlement, and reduced marketing spend"
"Growth from Windows 10, the shift toward higher gross margin products and services in devices and gaming, and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33% and 37% in constant currency"
"Now back to our overall company results, we invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of capital leases, as we continued to support customer and partner demand across our commercial and consumer services"
"During the quarter, other income and expense was $186 million"
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%
"We returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, completing our prior $40 billion share repurchase program this quarter, as we committed"
"Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX"
"We had originally expected FX rates to lessen going into H2. However, given current rates, we expect continued currency headwinds for the rest of the year"
"For Q3, we now expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue"
"Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing"
"In Q4, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on total revenue, 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing"
"Second, our commercial business, we expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth as we expand our install base, grow consumption, and execute well on renewals"
"We expect commercial unearned revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion, in line with historic seasonality"
We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud
"Third, CapEx, we will continue to meet customer demand by expanding data center capacity while driving efficiencies through new technologies"
"With the addition of LinkedIn, we expect our capital expenditures, including capital leases, to grow sequentially to support a broader portfolio"
"For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year"
Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments
"In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion"
"This reflects the continued annuity shift to the cloud with Office 365, Dynamics double-digit billings growth, and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting"
"In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services"
Enterprise Services revenue should decline again due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements
"And in More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.35 billion"
"In our OEM business, we anticipate revenue growth will exceed the overall PC market"
"Continued growth in Pro, driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10, should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market, with some additional benefit coming from the prior-year inventory build"
Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market due to strength in the premium device category
"In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2. As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we've passed the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated change in revenue recognition"
"And in Gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing balanced by higher engagement, usage, and transaction volume"
"In Devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone"
Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book
"We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses"
LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets
"We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn"
The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets
"For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn"
The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets
Other income and expense should be $150 million
"We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests"
"Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our BUILD Developer Conference in May here in Seattle"
We will share more details as we get closer to the date
"Chris, let's move to Q&A"
"Yeah, I think Satya is correct"
"The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on – excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses"
"As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue"
"So the in-quarter revenue and the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses, which will also hit"
We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves
"And I think, Brent, in terms of there being a date, a very particular date, this is something, to Satya's point, we've been doing in a step function improvement over time for the past couple years, and we'll continue to do it"
And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business
"In fact, in some ways, it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas"
So I think that's how I tend to look at it
"Thanks, Heather"
"Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer"
"You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 365, as well as our Azure core and premium services"
"And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud"
"It benefits margin, not just in Azure but across actually the entirety of the cloud"
"That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected"
But I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety
"But I do respect people always wonder, so I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure specifically"
I am sticking with it being about a point
That's the guidance we gave
"And even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it's about a point"
"So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it"
"Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business"
And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows
That tends to have a very good margin profile
"And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve"
"And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile"
"So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year"
"But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps"
Thanks
"Thanks, Mark"
Let me start by saying it's why we tend to focus all up at that server products and services KPI being double digits generally an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the on-prem business
"But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter, and then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward"
"We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year"
That value prop is resonating
We saw some growth
I feel very good about that
And so I do think that can have an impact in H2. You heard me talk a little bit about it
"With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us"
"It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2. And so it will be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide"
But I would reiterate the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw
"Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn"
So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth
But the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition and IC
"The way I think about it, we really – Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago – it's been a little longer than that now, to over-index on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud"
We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition cost
We invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities and our sales force
We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers
That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number
"And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts"
"A lot of that account value frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue"
Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be
And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have
And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making
It's starting to pivot to consumed
It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet
But I think you're right
We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient
"People often think we focus on cut here, add here"
"It's also about, are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful? And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, whether it's how we build products"
And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land
"And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors"
But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate
And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core
"And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications"
"And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution"
The margins weren't as high either
And so I do think it will be a blend of those
"But certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from"
"And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. Transitions take time"
"And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice"
"But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3. And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads"
"And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace"
Sure
Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously
"I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer"
I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful
"I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter, and it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn"
Our real goal for LinkedIn is – over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets
"But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members"
And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure
"So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy"
