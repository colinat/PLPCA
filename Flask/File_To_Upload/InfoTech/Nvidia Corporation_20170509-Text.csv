"Finally, automotive, revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules"
We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problems of autonomous driving
"Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just one year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations, and startups have begun developing with it"
"That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform's enhanced processing power and the introduction of Tensor RT for its in-vehicle AI inferencing"
"This quarter, we announced two important partnerships"
"Bosch, the world's largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world's carmakers, is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform"
"And PACCAR, one of the largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF"
We continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving
"The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns, and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone"
"We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks, and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018. Now turning to the rest of the Q1 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue"
Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million
"Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative"
"GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago"
"For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million"
"Non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion"
"For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends"
"In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends"
"Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%"
"Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially"
"GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points"
These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million
"GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes"
Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million
"GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items"

Please limit your questions to two
"Operator, will you please poll for the questions? Question-and-Answer Session"
Thanks for the question
We feel good about the guidance that we're providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure that it was understood the impact of Intel that's incorporated in there
"It's still too early, given that it's – to say about the same size of what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up"
"But again, we do believe data center is a super-great opportunity for us"
I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow
"But we don't have any more additional details on our guidance, but we feel good about the guidance that we gave"
