"Thanks, Gabrielle"
I’m pleased to report that PayPal ended 2016 with another solid quarter of financial results
"I’m proud of all the accomplishments that the PayPal team delivered, yet in so many ways we were just scratching the surface of the market opportunities in front of us"
Payments are rapidly digitizing
Mobile is re-defining the phase of retail
"And with the world wide adoption of smart phone consumers have all the power of a bank branch in the palm of their hands, which will no doubt transform the way they manage and move money"
We believe all of these secular trends play into our strengths and leave us well positioned to drive our future growth
"In the phase of a noisy competitive market, we extended our industry leaderships by growing our active account base by 18 million with greater engagements than ever before"
We introduced a host of new innovations across our merchant and consumer value propositions
We took the clear lead in online conversion through one touch
"We now offer a full suite of products and services to our merchants on an integrated platform that supports 100% share of processing and textual commerce API and toolsets, rewards integration and credit"
"And we bring to our merchants an increasingly active and growing days of consumers who are ready to transact across online, in-app, and in-store environments"
"In the past year, we significantly increased our market opportunity for the series of transformative strategic partnerships with the networks, financial institutions, tax companies, and mobile carriers"
We accomplish this by putting our customers first in everything we do
We call this being a customer champion and this philosophy guides our every action
"At the end of a land mark year for PayPal, we feel well positioned to deliver sustainable and profitable growth in 2017 and beyond"
Let me start with a quick recap of our results and John will provide more details in his remarks
"As I mentioned, we delivered a solid fourth quarter"
"We reported $0.42 of non-GAAP EPS at the top end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.42. We delivered $2.981 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis"
"This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow"
"For the full year we delivered $1.50 of non-GAAP EPS, which came in at the top of our initial full-year guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Our revenues grew 21% on a pro forma FX neutral basis above our initial 2016 guidance of 19%"
"And despite the increased size of our revenue base, we grew faster in 2016 than in 2015. We ended the year at $10.84 billion of revenue and we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, well above the initial guidance we provided"
"Perhaps more importantly, the underlining drivers of our revenue growth saw continued strong performance throughout 2016. We ended the year with $197 million active customer accounts, adding 5.4 million new accounts in Q4, our highest organic total in two years"
"Customer engagement in the fourth quarter increased to 31 transactions for active accounts up from 27 a year ago, and 30 last quarter"
Our growth in Q4 came from across our global platform and we benefited from a notable shift in consumer behavior
Holiday shoppers increasingly bought gifts online and with their mobile devices through convenient omni-channel shopping experiences
"For PayPal, this helps drive a 25% increase in payment volume, resulting in $99.3 billion of payment volume in the quarter"
"According to Internet retailer, Black Friday 2016 was the largest mobile shopping day in history"
Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday PayPal processed more than 2 billion in mobile payments
And mobile accounted for a third of our overall payment volume during the quarter
Mobile is becoming an increasingly important competitive differentiator for PayPal
More than half of our active account base transacted on the PayPal platform using their mobile device over the last 12 months
The scale and reach of our platform clearly separates PayPal as one of the world's leading FinTech companies
"In 2016, we processed 6 billion payments, an increase of 24%"
"This represented a total payment volume of 354 billion flowing through the PayPal platform of which more than 100 billion was mobile payment volume, an increase of 55%"
"We saw strong growth in peer-to-peer payments, with P2P payment volume growing 57%, more than $64 billion for the year"
"Braintree ended the quarter with 428 million cards on file, and PayPal has well over a billion financial instruments on file"
"In Venmo, was one of Time magazine's best apps of the year and one of Fortunes 10 breakthrough brands"
"In Q4, Venmo processed 5.6 billion volume, an increase of 126%"
"In December, for the first, Venmo passed the 2 billion mark in monthly payment volume further demonstrating its rapid growth"
"As you may recall, Venmo processed 1 billion in monthly TPV for the first time just last January"
"For the full year, Venmo processed $17.6 billion, up 135%"
It’s been several years since we expanded our mission to be more than a button on the website
"We have evolved to become the platform and payments partner of choice for merchants around the world, as they move towards a multichannel retail experience driven by the mobile phone"
"For example, with Braintree's commerce infrastructure tools, we are creating simpler ways for merchant install for contextual commerce experiences that transform the way consumers shop and pay"
"For entries forward API, which merchants securely share, payment data with other sites and apps, allowing customers to purchase from multiple merchants in a single convenient and secure experience"
"This capability was initially deployed to support interest viable pins and is now being used by merchants across the world, including global, travel site, sky scanner and by Yelp for their new product, Yelp cash back"
One Touch has redefined online checkout
Simply put it produces by its and away the best conversion rate in the payments industry by making it faster and simpler for customers to pay with the single tax
Its adoption has well exceeded our projections
We ended the year with over 5 million merchants offering One Touch to more than 40 million consumers
PayPal has the unique distinction in the corresponding benefit of having a deep and trusted relationship with almost 200 million merchants and consumer accounts through our two sided network
This means we can deliver new payment experiences like One Touch for the speed and impact that there is truly differentiated
eBay and PayPal have always enjoyed a close partnership
eBay CEO Devin Wenig and I are committed to further strengthening what is already a strong relationship
We are working closely to creating better payment experiences for their buyers and sellers
"For example, our teams collaborated this past year on new customized checkout experiences that helps to reduce card abandonment, increase loyalty, and help buyers seamlessly transact on eBay's platform"
"As we look to 2017, we see even greater opportunities to work together"
"In the quarter, we were also proud to welcome several great brands to our platform"
"DE, the second-largest retailer in Europe, Crate and Barrel, which now offers PayPal as a payment option on its web and mobile sites, and on the CB2 and landed not cite for their global customers"
"Squarespace, an all in one website publishing e-commerce platform"
Now it’s more than 1 million paid subscribers
Seamlessly integrate PayPal into their online stores
"To give you an idea of the demand for PayPal within the first 24 hours of launching, we saw hundreds of Squarespace merchants integrate into PayPal and that demand continues"
"Finally, consumers can now create a campaign on go funding on behalf of their favorite charity"
By doing so they take advantage of the PayPal giving funds facility to receive and process donations and avoid the complexity of having to handle the funds themselves
"Last year, highlighted our commitment to putting our customer’s front and centre"
That led to our decision to offer greater customer choice in our payments experiences
This in turn has a recast to competitive landscape for PayPal and enables landmark partnerships and alliances that continue to expand and extend our opportunity for growth
"These partnerships are focused on giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to use PayPal anywhere they want, in stores, in apps, online and a new context for the consistent, convenient, and secure experience, following the announcements of our strategic partnership with Visa on our Q2 earnings call and MasterCard in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we announced our first partnership agreement with financial institutions"
"These include agreements with Citi, the largest global credit card issuer and Fidelity National Information Services known as FIS, which represents thousands of financial institutions"
This is just the beginning
As our conversation with almost all leading financial service players are warm and welcoming
"Earlier this month, we announced the strategic agreement with Discover Financial Services"
This partnership allows the PayPal wallet to be closely linked and Discover cardholders acquires and merchants
"It will allow PayPal credit customers who link their discover cards to purchase online, in-app and in-store at contact listed enable merchants in the US"
"And in a first for us, PayPal customers will be able to use their discover cash back bonus to pay for purchases at the millions of online and mobile merchants that accept PayPal"
"We expect that the reward points will become an easy convenient and alternative source for customers of PayPal and our financial institution partners, the pay for online and mobile shopping due to PayPal platform"
"As mobile and digital payments continue to provide new opportunities for bringing cost consumers and companies close together, we're partnering with other market leaders across a variety of industries"
"In the fourth quarter, we entered into an extended partnership with cellular carriers, software providers and leading consumer brands"
One prominent example of this is the global partnership agreement we announced with Intuit
"Building on successful regional agreements, we are not deploying our express checkout and more than 1.5 million quick book small businesses and self-employed customers worldwide"
The PayPal and Intuit partnerships due to business owners simpler and faster ways to accept invoice payments and significantly accelerate the fees with which they can collect funds
"Based on our role out in Australia, we found that merchants who offered PayPal payments in their quick book invoices will pay two times faster than it to get paid without PayPal"
This meaningful improvement in cash flow is crucial for the SMB market
We are proud to bring this benefit to Intuits customers
"Our partnerships with Facebook, Google, American Mobile, Vodafone, AliExpress, and other financial institutions and major retailers continue to grow as our platform and capabilities expand"
2016 was a transformative year for PayPal
"Our separation from eBay afforded us an opportunity to sign a unique, meaningful, and expansive mission for our company"
I believe our expanded focus and value proposition allowed us to widen the distance from our competitors
"We upgraded our platform invested significantly in our global compliance capabilities, improved our developer tool sets, and drove our scale and engagement through a unique and enhanced value proposition"
We are inspired and focused on the opportunities in front of us and we look forward to providing ever more value to our customers and our shareholders
Before I conclude my remarks I’d like to just take this opportunity to publicly welcome the newest member of PayPal’s Board Belinda Johnson
Belinda has filled an impressive track record at Airbnb
She has been a key architect in their growth and has held to chart new business approaches and innovative customer experiences
She’s already proving to be a great addition to our board and we look forward to her valuable contributions
"And with that, let me hand it over to John"
You're talking about the increase in our revenue guidance?
"So, we are taking off our revenue guidance on an FX neutral basis and the reason we are doing that is there is a tremendous amount of secular tailwinds that we are seeing right now"
"As I mentioned in my remarks, seeing money digitizing is a big move to mobile, it is a big move to really online being sort of online payments and then pick up in stores or commerce is really just becoming commerce"
"I mean a great example of that is this was the best retail holiday season in five years, but you saw - in-store sales actually drop and online move up to almost 17%, 18% or so"
"And so as we look at these secular tailwinds behind us, we look at the performance of things like One Touch and its clear advantage that we have now in mobile and the scale we have the increased engagement we are seeing"
New market opportunities frankly internationally that we are beginning to see and have a platform now that we can extend to many more markets of Venmo
We see the beginning of monetization as we come into this year
"And we are seeing the back of the year, the beginnings of some in-store volumes based on tokenization and our partnerships with both the network and financial institutions and then we've got a tremendous number of new partnerships, whether it be with Facebook, or Intuit or FI’s really around the world right now that is growing exponentially since we've announced our network agreement"
So there are a host of reasons right now that our confidence has improved in terms of our top line growth rate and by the way that’s also lacking 200 million of Xoom
"So think about that, as well as you think about kind of the revenue guidance we gave"
"So, we think they are good prospects ahead of us"
We are very focused on those opportunities and we are comfortable with that guidance
Bryan it’s Dan
I’ll take the first part of that and then I’ll wisely let John take the next part of it
"So, let me just back up a little bit, as you know and everyone on the call knows credit is and will continue to be an important flywheel for us"
Credit gives flexible payment option to both our margins and to consumers
"It reduces card abandonment, it increases basket size for our merchants and consumers"
When somebody uses credit they do two times the spend on our PayPal network than somebody who doesn't
"When we do PayPal working capital on average those that we lend to, they see their sales go up 20% plus, and so it’s a tremendous flywheel for us"
It is a small part of a business and it’s likely to remain so as well
"We don't need to chase growth here, we can be very responsible and who we lend to and how much we lend to them"
And we have great amounts of data and really I think world class modeling around this
"That said that is no reason really to use our balance sheet or the receivables and there are, as we've mentioned before, a lot of benefits of asset right"
"Obviously, we tie up a lot of our free cash flow in the receivables with free cash flow, for other capital allocation that we might do, we have reduced exposure, we still have a differentiated proposition that we would use our data and our modeling with our partner to bring back a differentiated proposition into our phase and there are very attractive economics to share"
"And as we've seen right now, from people who are very interested in partnering with us, our portfolio is very effective"
"The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business"
That is a working hypothesis as we are going through this
"We are in the early process of looking through this right now because it is a very competitive process out there as people look to potentially partner with us, you know we look to make a decision as we digest and sort through all the different proposals that we’re seeing, that said very much likely to be a - if we go and how we do this exactly with the back half of 2017 event, but clearly there is a lot of demand, there is a lot of benefits for us moving towards asset light and we think as I mentioned you reduce risk and maintain strong economics for the business"
Let me try and jump the two questions in there
So let me start with the mobile and then I will go into the impact of some regulatory and change of administrations
"Mobile, mobile is driving growth in the industry right now"
I mean more half the sales that are going online are being driven by mobile
"Mobile is blurring lines of distinction between in-store environment and online environments, where like commerce is just becoming commerce"
"And truthfully, mobile is the biggest competitive differentiator for us"
"If we think about mobile, the real problem that merchants have with mobile is that when a browser begins the shopping experience on mobile between 65% and 74% of the time there is card abandonment because it’s such a small screen, it’s difficult to put of the payment information in there et cetera"
So with One Touch we have 87% conversion on mobile
87%
"The next closest is 51%, the industry average is like 44%"
"So, we are at almost double the industry average in terms of the mobile experience that we see and mobile is exploring across the world, as well as I mentioned in terms of why did we take up our revenue guidance, pick it up because we see opportunity across the world and that’s predominantly driven by mobile"
"So, I had spent mobile to continue to fewer our growth"
"Remember one other thing I said in my remarks with over half of our active basis on mobile payment transaction is through the PayPal platform in the last 12 months, over 100 billion in the volume of 55% for the year"
"So expect that to, not particular what the growth rate will be one way or the other, but mobile is going to be a strong driver of growth and it’s a big differentiator for us"
"No, I was thinking in, see if I can [indiscernible]"
I will start of a little bit and then you can jump in
"So, like I say in terms of Venmo monetization pricing very little actually built into our guidance for 2017. We fully intend to rollout out Venmo, previous Venmo in a much broader basis in 2017. And we will see some impact in that, but really the big impact on that happens in 2018 and 2019. And so just see that and that’s, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond it’s because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but let’s model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere and so not much is built into that"
"Not as much built into the customer choice piece of it, although I will say we’re pretty encouraged by the initial results that we’re seeing on choice"
"We rolled that choice through all of North America, right now on the servicing piece of choice, as well as the on boarding of that, we are just beginning in checkout right now, but as John mentioned in his remarks from a cost perspective it is well within our expectations in terms of transaction expense and engagement, it is better than we expected in terms of engagement which by the way is not really surprising"
"If you give somebody the choice to pay, they become more engaged, the average price that they pay or the basket size that they have goes up, as well these are not surprising"
"We anticipated, but it’s nice to see those things starting to really happen in the market, but we have a ton of that built into our guidance as well that to me is more of a 2018, 2019 phenomenon"
It's Dan
I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call
We know how busy all of you are and we look forward to seeing you at our investor conferences and talking to you on our next earnings call as well
"So, thank you very much for your time"
