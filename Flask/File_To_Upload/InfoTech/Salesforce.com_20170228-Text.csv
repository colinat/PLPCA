"Thanks, Marc"
"Obviously, this was an exceptional quarter"
"Salesforce is the fastest-growing top five enterprise software company in the world, and this year, we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue"
"And that will reach the milestone that we've been talking about, about being faster than any other enterprise software company in history to that $10 billion mark"
"In FY 2017, we drove tremendous execution, growth of scale and delivered unprecedented customer success"
"And we did this while integrating Demandware, our largest acquisition ever, launching innovative new products, including Einstein, and adding more than 5,000 employees"
"When I joined Salesforce nearly four years ago, Marc and I put together a plan to become more strategic to our customers and to become more of an enterprise skilled company, and that plan really had three parts to it"
Number one was the focus on industry
This is all about speaking the language of the customer and bringing industry expertise and launching industry products in the marketplace
The second was expanding our international reach to serve our global customers
"Very, very important"
"And the last was building the world's strongest ecosystem in the cloud, and that was with our SI partners and our ever-expanding ISV community"
"Well today, we have strategic relationships with the largest and most successful companies in the world"
"We're inspiring companies of all sizes, all industries and all geographies"
We have clearly become the trusted advisor to our customers for their digital transformations
"All of this is translating to our results, including a record number of big transactions"
"In fact, we hit a huge milestone this fiscal year which we're incredibly proud of, and that was achieving 100 $10 million-plus relationships on an annual basis and the number of $20 million-plus relationships has nearly doubled in just one year"
Pretty incredible progress
"Now, let's talk about some of the highlights in the quarter, starting with our industry strategy, again one of our growth pillars"
We had strong growth in Q4 in all of our target industries
"In fact, the largest deal in the quarter was a massive expansion with one of the world's leading CPG brands based in Europe using Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to deliver personalized consumer experiences"
"We expanded our relationships in Q4 with three of the five largest CPG companies in the world, all of them running on Salesforce"
"And, as you recall from last quarter, our momentum is continuing in financial services"
"In Q4, we expanded relationships with U.S"
"Bank, SunTrust, TD Bank and many, many more"
We're also building on a very strategic relationship with Farmers Insurance
"Now that's from our early days in helping them modernize their customers' self-service to bringing more synergy across their customer, agent, employee and partner channels"
Healthcare continues to be strong for us
"In Q4, we expanded relationships with Anthem, athenahealth and one of the largest healthcare companies in the United States, Humana"
And just a quick update on Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud
It's been less than a year since they've been GA and we've already seen great traction
"In fact, more than 70% of customers who have purchased one of these industry solutions are net new logos to Salesforce in this fiscal year"
So all of these are proof positive around the power of speaking the language of the customer
"Now on to international, our second growth strategy"
Each of our regions grew more than 25% in constant currency for the full year
"In fact, EMEA and Asia Pac both grew 29% year-over-year in constant currency"
"So today, nearly 30% of our revenue is outside of the Americas and this represents a huge, huge growth opportunity for us"
And we'll continue to accelerate our international expansion to meet our customers' demand and I fully expect our revenue mix to be more balanced over time
"And this is, again, something that we're very, very focused on and very excited about"
"Now to that end, we expanded relationships in Q4 with some amazing brands like Shell, Michelin, Emirates and Maersk in Europe"
"We drove strong financial services momentum as well, again, in the industry with 5 of the top 15 banks in Europe this quarter including Banco Santander and BCC, again, all running their business on Salesforce"
"We had other huge international wins in the quarter with BRF, Latin America's largest food company, also with the Japanese Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Tax and Fujisoft, all in Japan"
"So great progress, again, on the international front"
"As far as partner momentum, we continue to strengthen our partner ecosystem"
"In fact, we are seeing partners grow their Salesforce practices by more than 50%"
"Today, every single one of the top five SIs in the world run their business on Salesforce"
We have an incredible partnership with them
"In the quarter, they expanded their relationship with us, rolling out sales, service, analytics and of course, the Salesforce platform"
We're also seeing strong momentum in our ISV community and the innovation around our platform in that community
"In fact, today nearly 90% of the Fortune 100 are running apps from the AppExchange and these are apps that are being installed by customers at a rate of more than one per minute every single day, which is pretty incredible"
"Now before I wrap up, I want to say how proud I am of the company and our ability to integrate more than a dozen acquisitions in FY 2017 while still delivering really record-breaking results"
"And look, this operational excellence, it's already paying off"
We're driving incredible value and innovation for our customers
"In fact, this quarter, we had a huge set of Commerce Cloud wins with Levi's and The Gap and YETI and many, many others"
"And Commerce Cloud grew customer gross merchandise value by 26% in constant currency from a year ago, again, an acceleration from Q3. So look, in summary, I would tell you that no other technology company is building the relationships that we are"
We are driving incredible innovation
We're bringing huge value to our customers
We continue to inspire our customers
"We continue to paint a vision for their success, and as I said, we are executing at scale across every part of the company and delivering success for our customers better than anybody else in the world"
"And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark"
"Kash, hi, it's Keith"
So thank you for the complex multipart question
I'll lead off with this part
"So as you know, we did a dozen plus acquisitions in FY 2017; the integration has gone incredibly well as we continue to operate the company at scale and growth"
We have a standard template and process when we integrate these companies in all lines of business
"So for example, in the go-to-market business aspect of the company, we try to keep these companies together because we want to incubate them"
We want to grow them
We want to nurture them
"We want to bring them into our culture, but we also want to make sure that we allow or we put them in a position where we can attach to the install base and the customer"
So they can get the power of Salesforce when they come into the company
We've seen some great success
"A good example of that is the Demandware acquisition, now called Commerce Cloud"
The GMV growth was excellent
We signed up some great business in the quarter
But it's – because we have a standard model from an operational perspective on how we bring these companies in so that we minimize disruption and we try to get them to hit the ground running as fast as we can
"Well, I think that the – I think it's pretty clear that customers – the company over the last 18 years has had an incredible vision and consistently has delivered new innovation to the marketplace"
"Obviously, pioneer in cloud, and bringing Sales Cloud to the market 18 years ago was a great start"
It was a first act
Many companies never get beyond that first act
"We've gotten beyond the first act, the second act, the third act, the fourth act, and we're well into our fifth act-plus around innovation and Einstein is certainly a great example of that"
"If I looked at use cases for Einstein, overall, I would tell you that this is really bringing insight to action across sales and service and marketing and commerce, if you think about opportunity insights or account insights, predictability scoring, et cetera, et cetera"
"I mean, I can go through every one of the lines of business"
"But at the end of the day, yet again, you're painting a vision for our customers and providing them with a very compelling technology to get insights about their customers and what sort of use cases that that technology can be applied to"
So every customer that I've spoken with is hugely excited about the potential for Einstein and what it means to their business models and their business
And we're just starting to see the beginning of it
Yeah
"So, hi, it's Keith, let me take this"
"So, look, we put a premium on what we refer to as enablement, right? We bring a lot of people into the company, 5,000-plus people this year"
"And we spend an incredible amount of focus time making sure that our people – all of our people are brought up to speed on the features and functions of any of our cloud, take Service Cloud as an example since it's the one that you asked about"
"And we take advantage of some amazing technology; Trailhead is an example, so we're making sure that we can bring people up to speed and hit the ground running very quickly"
So this is an ongoing thing
We don't just train somebody once and then that's it
There's no end of job when it comes to the training and enablement
"As I said, I think it's one of the reasons why we're so different than the rest of the marketplace in terms of the effectiveness of our go-to-market teams"
"And specifically on Service Cloud, look, we're the market leader, okay? So we had amazing growth"
The Magic Quadrant
"We're the market leader of the Magic Quadrant with Gartner, if you take a look at that"
This is a $2.5 billion run rate business
"It is – after Sales Cloud, it is the largest cloud, I guess you could say, company in the world in terms of size and scale"
"And again, we're taking market share"
We're number one in the marketplace
So we've got incredible capabilities
We continue to improve the product
"We're enabling our sales teams and our customers' success teams, and I think it shows up in our results"
Let me talk about that
"So we're in an enviable position where we're a market leader in every cloud that we make and produce and bring to the market, and that drives incredible amounts of customer success into the marketplace for our customers"
And that is where we are laser-focused
"And when we go to market, we go to market on a solution basis, which is typically a multi-cloud solution"
"So that could be by industry, that could be by line of business"
"But when I think about, for example, the top 10 deals in the quarter, I can tell you that 8 of the top 10 deals in our quarter in Q4 had multi-cloud solutions"
So that means it wasn't just Sales Cloud
"It was Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, or it was Marketing Cloud and communities, or it included Analytics, et cetera"
"So again, customers are buying solutions"
"They buy solutions because they're looking to solve a business problem, and we are uniquely positioned to solve those business problems in the marketplace as it relates to customer engagement"
So we're in a great product position
We have an excellent execution strategy which I outlined in the call earlier
"And yeah, just to give you an example, I talked a lot earlier about the level of relationships that we're establishing with these customers"
"When I talked about achieving this goal of 100 $10 million-plus relationships and doubling the number of $20 million-plus relationships, just to put that into perspective, if you go back to – I joined the company back in FY 2014 – and again, I had the privilege of working with an amazing team and an amazing company"
"But to put that in perspective, fast forward to where we are today"
"We have three times, three times the $10 million-plus relationships with customers than we had back in FY 2014. We have five times the $20 million-plus relationships that we had back in FY 2014. Well, how did that happen? Well, it happened because we had a compelling vision"
"It happened because we had a multi-cloud portfolio that added a lot of value, incredible value, that allowed these customers to drive digital transformation and engage with their customers in entirely new ways, in unprecedented ways"
So there is an incredible amount of opportunity on an attach basis across all of our clouds
"We're seeing more and more demand for it, and we are uniquely positioned to provide that for our customer base"
Absolutely
I think it's listening
"Listening is very, very important, but also it's bringing a point of view, whether it's an industry perspective or a line of business perspective, as I said before"
"At the end of the day, let's use consumer packaged goods, in a quarter, three out of the top five consumer packaged goods companies in the world, and these are massive companies"
These are brands that we all know and we'll talk a little bit about that next week
They are expanding their relationships
They are betting their business on Salesforce
Yeah
So this is Keith
"Look, we talked about this earlier"
CRM is the fastest-growing enterprise market and we're the market leader
We continue to separate from the rest of the marketplace
There's a number of reasons for that
"Obviously, it starts with a compelling vision, an incredible execution and operations of scale"
But we started off the year with a fantastic quarter
"We're certainly very, very proud of the entire company and are very thankful to our employees, and all of our – really all of our stakeholders"
But we have some momentum carrying into the quarter
"And I think that's reflected in our forward guide, which I think Marc and Mark talked about"
So there's a lot of momentum
We're very excited
"We've got a great story, a compelling vision for our customers and we continue to execute in an unprecedented way, better than anybody else in the marketplace"
"Marc, I don't know if you want to add"
