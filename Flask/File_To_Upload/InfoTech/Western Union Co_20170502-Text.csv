"Thank you, Hikmet"
First quarter reported revenues of $1.3 billion were flat or increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior-year period
"The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $30 million compared to the prior year"
"In the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, revenues were flat in the quarter or increased 2% constant currency, while transactions grew 2%"
C2C constant currency revenue benefited from strong growth in westernunion
"com, while geographically growth was driven by Latin America, North America and Europe and CIS regions"
"Total C2C cross-border principal increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis, while principal per transaction declined 2% or 1% in constant currency terms"
The 1% cross-border principal increase was an improvement from the 1.5% decline we reported for the 2016 full year
"Last month, the World Bank updated its cross-border remittance principal estimates, and its data indicates the overall market declined 1.2% in 2016, following a 2.7% decline in 2015. Factors cited by the World Bank for the decline last year included low oil prices, weak economies in the Gulf states and Russia, reduced flows from Europe to Africa and the translation impact of the stronger U.S"
dollar
"The World Bank is projecting an improvement in 2017, driven by stronger global economic outlook"
"Returning to the first quarter results, the spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 2 percentage points, including a negative 2% impact from currency"
"Mix had a negative impact of approximately 2% in the quarter, while pricing had a positive impact of approximately 2%, primarily driven by price increases implemented last year, and that remained in place"
We continue to view the current pricing environment as stable
"Turning to the regions, we implemented a new regional structure this quarter in our C2C segment due to some leadership and organizational changes"
"Changes include a few modifications in the country composition of the segments by geographic regions, which we detailed in an 8-K we published last week and are also available in our 10-Q"
"In addition, we have changed the methodology of our regional reporting to allocate 100% of revenues to the send region rather than our previous practice of splitting the revenues 50-50 based on the region in which the money was originated and the region in which it was received"
"We believe this new methodology provides you with a better understanding of where our business is originated around the world, and how economic trends and other macro events may affect our results"
We have provided the 2016 historical quarterly regional results using this method in the filings I just mentioned
"So, turning to the regions, regional results for the first quarter, I'll be referring to constant currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the regions' results"
"North America again generated good growth in the quarter with revenue increasing 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions grew 5%"
"outbound, particularly to Latin American countries, continue to be a strong grower"
"to Mexico business increased, although growth trends were not as good as the very strong results we delivered in the fourth quarter"
The strengthening of the Mexican peso likely contributed to a slowdown in the market growth for the quarter
"However, our Mexico business did continue to grow faster than the market based on the latest Banco de MÃ©xico principal and transaction data for the first quarter"
"domestic money transfer revenue was somewhat softer, primarily due to the impact of some price decreases we implemented in parts of the market in the second half of last year"
"In the Europe and CIS region, revenue declined 1% or increased 4% on a constant currency basis, while transactions increased 8%"
"Revenue growth in the region is consistent with the fourth quarter, while transactions benefited from growth of lower-priced transactions in Russia"
"In the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region, revenue declined 13% or 10% constant currency, and transactions were down 15% as low oil prices continued to negatively affect key send markets"
The regions' results were also impacted by reduced sends from these countries into India
Total inbound business to India was down just over 20% in the quarter
"That compared to the 30% revenue decrease we saw in November and December following the government demonetization actions, and we did see month-by-month improvement in the trends during the quarter"
"In the Asia-Pacific region, revenue was down 2% or 1% constant currency, while transactions decreased 2%"
Business originating in the Latin America and Caribbean region was very strong
"Revenue grew 26% or 25% constant currency, while transactions grew 17%, led by Argentina and several other markets"
"A combination of strong economic performance and currencies, market reforms, previous pricing actions and marketing programs helped drive the regions growth"
com's C2C revenue continued its strong performance trend with revenue increasing 26% or 28% constant currency on 27% transaction growth
"com represented 9% of total C2C revenue in the quarter, up from 7% in the first quarter of last year"
"In the Consumer-to-Business segment, revenue increased 8% or 10% on a constant currency basis"
Constant currency revenue growth continued to be driven by the Argentina walk-in and U.S
"electronic businesses, which were partially offset by declines in U.S"
cash walk-in
"Business Solutions revenues declined 6% or 3% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of XE"
com business
"Revenues were also impacted by a decline in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in some markets"
"Geographically, good growth in Europe was offset by declines in North America and Asia-Pacific"
"Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated operating margin in the quarter was 18.4%"
"Excluding the impact of costs related to the WU Way transformation program, adjusted operating margin was 19.5% in the quarter, which compares to 19.9% in the prior year period"
"The adjusted margin decline was driven by the impact of foreign exchange and customer and funding mix in C2B, partially offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend"
"Foreign exchange hedges in the quarter had a positive impact of $7 million, down from a benefit of $15 million in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect approximately $25 million in hedge benefits for the full year compared to $48 million of benefit in 2016. In total, currency negatively impacted operating profit by approximately $15 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year"
"Compliance expense was 3.7% of revenue for this first quarter, and we still expect to be in the higher end of the 3.5% to 4% of revenues range for the full year"
"We recorded $14 million of WU Way expenses in the quarter, while expected savings are weighted more towards the second half of the year"
EBITDA margin was 23.5%
"Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding WU Way expenses, was 24.6% compared to 25% in the prior year period"
The decline was due to the same factors that affected our operating margin
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%
"Excluding the impact of WU Way-related expenses, the adjusted tax rate was 24.8%, which compares to 14.6% in the prior-year period"
"The higher tax rate in the quarter was due to the impact of changes in the internal ownership structure of certain of the company's international subsidiaries, which were implemented to help address upcoming regulatory changes in Europe"
"The first quarter negative impact is expected to be largely offset by lower taxes of a comparable amount over the remainder of the year, resulting from the structural changes"
The GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 in the first quarter includes a negative $0.02 impact from the WU Way-related expenses
"Excluding these expenses, adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 compares to $0.37 in the first quarter of last year with the decline primarily driven by the higher tax rate"
"The C2C margin was 22.4%, which compares to 22.7% in the prior year period, has a negative impact of foreign exchange and offset by benefits from timing of marketing spend"
The Consumer-to-Business operating margin was 12.2% in the quarter compared to 14.6% in the prior year
The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to customer and funding mix in the U.S
"electronic business, including increased credit card usage, although the margin improved substantially relative to the fourth quarter"
Business Solutions operating profit margin was 2.5% in the quarter compared to 2.4% in the prior year period
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior year period
"The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 13.7%, which compare to 15.1% in the first quarter of 2016 with the decline primarily caused by higher technology expense"
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet in the first quarter
"Cash flow from operating activities was $86 million, which includes $151 million of payments related to the settlement with the Federal and state governments announced in January, and approximately $19 million of WU Way-related payments"
"Excluding these items, cash flow from operating activities was $256 million in the quarter"
The remaining $440 million of legal settlement payments will be made in the second quarter
Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter
"At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $1.3 billion with approximately half of the cash held by United States entities"
"During the quarter, we issued $400 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 3.6%"
"We also returned $308 million to shareholders, including $83 million in dividend and $225 million of share repurchases, which equated to approximately 11 million shares"
"The outstanding share count at quarter end was 472 million shares, and we had $1.2 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization"
"Based on the first quarter results and our recent business trends, we are affirming our full year outlook"
We expect GAAP revenue to be flat to down low-single digits with constant currency revenue increasing in the low-single digits
"GAAP operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% and adjusted operating margin approximately 20%, excluding approximately $100 million of WU Way-related expenses"
"Our outlook include savings of approximately $20 million from deficiency actions included in the WU Way initiatives in 2017, and we expect approximately $25 million of additional savings in 2018. In addition to the impact from the subsidiary ownership structure, we also expect other discrete tax benefits in the fourth quarter, which we're anticipated in our original outlook"
"For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 11%, while the adjusted rate is expected to be approximately 13%"
"Quarterly, we anticipate rates closer to our full year outlook in the second and third quarters, and then a very low tax rate in Q4. We continue to expect full year GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the WU Way-related expenses, in the range of $1.63 to $1.75. Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange"
GAAP cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $200 million in 2017 due to the impact of the $591 million payments related to the settlement agreement with the U.S
and State governments announced in January to be approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the previously-announced IRS agreement in December 2011 and the WU Way-related payment
"Excluding these items, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion"
"So, to summarize, the first quarter business performance was solid, strategic progress continued and we are on track with our full-year outlook"
"Operator, we're now ready to take questions"
Question-and-Answer Session
"I mean, as we go through the course of the year, Tien-Tsin, we should get benefits from the cost savings initiatives"
Most of that benefit will hit us in the second half of the year
"And then, based on our current forecast for foreign exchange rates, we think that FX impact will be a little bit less in the second half of the year, so you get a pickup on those items"
"We had somewhat of a marketing benefit in the first quarter, and I expect that we'll get back to our normal averages for marketing spend, there's some timing in the first quarter"
So that will also pick up
"So, net-net, that's how we get back to roughly our 20% adjusted margin for the full year, and some of the things that will happen from a quarterly standpoint"
"It's the way â in our consumer bill payments business, we're seeing â we had couple of things happening over the course of the last year"
"We had a large customer that we brought on at lower margins, and then we also saw consumers using credit cards to make payments, and that's a more expensive transaction for us"
"So, it ends up being more expensive for us"
"And although margins were down from the first quarter of last year, we actually did improve quite a bit from the fourth quarter where we were in the C2B business"
"So, the goal there has been to get really good top-line growth, and we're getting a lot of success there, we're adding to the portfolio"
And then that gives us an opportunity to stabilize margins and maybe improve them over time
"Hi, Darrin"
And the great thing about India is that we have fantastic retail coverage
And we also have fantastic account coverage
We pay out into most accounts in India
the infrastructure is right to improve there
"I mean, we had planned on â obviously our outlook for the full year has not changed, so 11% and then 13% adjusted"
"So, we had planned on these activities for the year"
"The timing in the first quarter was less under our control, I would say"
"And so, we're going to get those same benefits the rest of this year, because we had planned on it"
"We've basically accelerated into Q1. And then, the second and third quarters should be closer to our full year average tax rate"
"And the fourth quarter, I would expect to be substantially lower because we have a number of different discrete benefits that we had already planned on, plus this timing benefit"
"So, it should be substantially lower than you'll see for even the second and third quarter as we go into the fourth quarter"
"Well, the XE"
com customer is something we spoke about last year
"We knew that we were going to lose it at the end of last year, which is what happened"
"And so we're going to see that grow over impact at least through the first three quarters of this year, a little bit in the fourth quarter"
"So you'll see a three-point impact from that as we move through, but our goal is to grow the business faster than what we achieved in the first quarter"
That's not an acceptable growth level for us
And we're doing a number of good things in that business where we want to drive better growth
"So I would not model minus 3% in that business, that's not our objective"
Our objective is to grow better than that
"The C2B business has been growing in the low double-digit range for quite a long time now, the last several years"
"And what we saw in the quarter, we also had good reported growth in that business of 8%, and that's because Argentina didn't devalue as much as we had expected"
But we continue to see really good growth opportunities for that business
"It's being driven by a couple of different things, the Argentina cash walk-in business where consumers are paying bills at retail locations, and then our electronic payments business here in the U.S"
And then that's being offset a little bit by U.S
"So, the growth profile of that business continues to be very strong, and we continue to add to the portfolio"
And we're very excited about the opportunities in that business
"No, it's a longer-term impact on the tax structure"
The activity relates specially to our Business Solutions business and the licensing requirements that are coming next year in Europe related to some of the products that we sell â the derivatives products that we sell
"So, we had to make some changes"
"As you know â as you may know, we own a bank in Austria"
"And so, we've combined or we're going to be combining those organizations to provide the right type of licensing structure ultimately"
So that's the underlying activity that we're driving at
"I mean, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize how we spend there"
"And over time, the composition of how we spent that money has changed, right? And as we've completed many of the Southwest Border requirements, that spending has gotten less over the last couple of years, but it's migrated to other programs"
"So, we're always putting technology in place and we want to automate those things"
"Our first priority this year really is to address the requirements that we have under the settlement agreements, and that's the reason for the higher spend this year"
And we'll look to stabilize as much as we can over time
"Well, Ashwin, I believe that the Western Union Business Solutions should have a better performance than we reported in Q1, I agree on that with you"
"I think, the global economic environment, when that improves, when more export-import connection happens, especially on the small and mid-sized business entities, that will improve given how linked that sending money and receiving money is with importer and exporter"
"Besides that, I don't believe that we need a significant investment there to improve our performance"
"It's more really a focus on the sales getting new customers, where its liking is that I understand more is on the foreign trade part â foreign exchange trade part on the hedges and on the forwards"
We have some performance issue
"However, the payments part, like the invested (42:11) payments, like NGO payments is doing very well"
How you pay your builds or cross-border builds during (42:18) performance very well
"However, on the trading part, foreign exchange trading part, we do need some more focus here"
"And I know the team is doing a little â putting also Wu Way activities around that's looking really how we can improve the part generally, this part has to improve, and I believe that over time it will improve"
It's all about mix
"You know our business very well, Ashwin, depending on the corridor"
"We do have corridors, which is zero FX"
"We do have corridors, which are higher FX, zero fees"
We do have corridors where there's both are that
"It's really like an airline management where you fly from one destination to another destination, which seats you for use, and that's exactly what we are doing with our teams"
"I think, in the portfolio management, the team is impressive"
"It's really looking at every corridor, understanding the customer needs on FX side"
I believe there is room
"We can be even better there, having the right balance between foreign exchange and fees, but our business model is built mostly on fee and less on FX"
"But there is, I believe, opportunity to see the customer need and go after that"
That keeps the â the mix also keeps the flexibility as to keeping the pricing stable
"And as I mentioned earlier, our prices are higher than the competition, but the market and the customer feel comfortable with the prices"
And the 2% constant currency growth is definitely something that are also transaction growth reflects that
"Yeah, our cash balance was higher at the end of the first quarter than we've had for some time"
"It was higher than the end of the year, because we did raise some debt in the first quarter"
We also issued some term debt as well as some commercial paper
And that's in anticipation of making these final payments for the legal settlements
So that's why you see a higher level of cash
"By the end of the year, we should be at a lower level of cash"
We currently have about half of the cash at the end of the first quarter U.S
"-based, and the rest of it's abroad"
"On an ongoing basis, we generate about 75% or so of our cash flow outside the U.S"
And that includes any repatriation that we may do back to the U.S
", normal repatriation"
"So, if we were to get comprehensive tax reform, that could potentially alleviate any future issues of repatriation of foreign profit, which should be a good thing for us"
"I mean, we're excited about the Facebook announcement and the potential there"
It's a great product
"Our customers really don't have to leave the messenger environment to do a transaction, but for us it's just another channel to allow customers to do a transaction with us, right"
"Whether it's Viber or WeChat or Facebook, we just want to provide as many avenues as possible for customers to be able to do a transaction with us"
"On Facebook specifically, whether they come through Facebook or whether they come to us directly on wu"
"com, we're really indifferent because the economics of that transaction are about the same for us"
"So, we'll see â it's early stages, but we'll see how that kind of transpires"
Yeah
We've raised the debt in the first quarter to make the payments in the second quarter â first and second quarter
"So, that's why you see an elevated level of debt"
"The only other piece that we have there is, we have a refinancing to do of another $500 million maturity at the end of this year"
"So, we will likely pre-finance that before the December maturity"
So you'll see potentially some higher levels of debt
"But by the end of the year, we should be at about where we were for the first quarter, assuming nothing else changes"
"Well, last year, we spent â we are at 3.6% of revenues in the first quarter"
"And in the first quarter this year, we're at 3.7%"
So it's not a dramatic difference
"And for the full year, I would expect this to be at the higher end of our 3.5% to 4% range"
"And in the last couple of years, we've been closer to 3.5%"
"I would expect to be at a more full run rate, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities there"
"So, right now, we plan for about $20 million this year, and then incrementally $25 million next year, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities for savings"
Sure
"I think, it has been obviously a great growth rate, and we believe that we are absolutely growing faster than the competition, and the team is executing very well"
"Don't forget, I mean, I said we are â just launched 40 countries, it's only 40 countries to send money to 200 countries"
"And the new countries will generate until they come really on a revenue generating mode, it will even be better, and then we want to be in 200 countries to send 200 countries, like our agent network"
And so that's something the team is focused
That's something that we are extremely optimistic that our digital expansion will continue
"And combining digital with retail, it's the secret sauce, different customer use cases"
"So, I'm quite optimistic, and the teams are also optimistic on that"
Still 80% of the customers didn't use the recent â retail money transferred for the last
