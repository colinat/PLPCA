"Thanks, Jeff"
"Before diving into quarter one results, I want to highlight a few changes we've made to our reporting beginning in 2017. As we previewed last quarter, post the spinoff of Conduent, we have streamlined the management of the business along geographic sales channels and, therefore, now have one reportable segment"
We are at the same time enhancing our disclosures to provide additional insight on our results
"Around revenue, we are providing additional details by geographic sales channel, by product grouping for equipment sales revenue, and will continue to provide line-of-sight to our document outsourcing, or what we now call Manage Document Services revenues, as well as progress on the shift over time of our revenues toward our strategic growth areas"
"On profitability, we'll be providing gross margins for both equipment and post sale revenues"
"On cash flow, we're providing some commentary around our expectations for normalized operating cash flow after we get past near-term higher restructuring payments and pension contributions"
We believe these reporting changes will give greater context to our results and perspective of our business model
I'll talk more about them as we go through the presentation
"With that, let's start with the review of the income statement, which I'm going to mainly talk to on an adjusted basis that excludes non-service retirement-related costs, restructuring and related costs, and amortization of intangible assets"
"In addition, this quarter, we had two other discrete items that we adjusted for, and that essentially offset, a $13 million charge related to the extinguishment of debt and a $16 million benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter related to a previously-adjusted item"
"Revenue, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide, was down $161 million, or 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency, which is consistent with full-year 2016. Looking at the cost ratios, savings from our strategic transformation program more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction-currency impact of 110 basis points, resulting in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points and an improvement in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 20 basis points"
"Within our definition of operating income is equity income, which was down year-over-year due to the Fuji Xerox receivable write-off that Jeff mentioned"
"As Fujifilm recently announced, they are reviewing the appropriateness of accounting practices related to certain sales of leasing transactions involving Fuji Xerox New Zealand"
"Our first quarter results included charge of approximately $30 million within equity income, representing our share of the current Fujifilm estimated adjustment for this review"
"Although the approximate $0.03 impact of the Fuji Xerox New Zealand receivable matter is included in our adjusted EPS, we are modifying our definition of adjusted operating margin to exclude this matter in order to present a more normalized view"
"On this basis, overall adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points and adjusted operating profit was up $6 million"
"So, from an operating perspective, overall good cost management offset revenue declines consistent with our expectations"
"Turning to the below-the-line items, other expenses net of $41 million was $4 million better year-over-year as lower interest expense roughly offset the gain on sales of assets in the prior year"
"The tax rate of 27.5% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28%, and was higher by 6.1 points year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.01 impact year-over-year to adjusted EPS"
"Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.15 was down $0.03 from Q1 2016 driven by the higher tax rate and the Fuji Xerox matter"
GAAP EPS was $0.02 in the quarter
"The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets, as well as the two discrete items I described earlier"
"Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue"
"Starting with total revenue, from a geographic perspective, North America was down 4.5%, or 4.8% in constant currency, and represented 60% of our revenues"
"International represented 35% of total revenue, and reflected higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we saw a turn there and overall improvement off a weak Q1 2016. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, which includes our OEM business, sales of Fuji Xerox and licensing"
"Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 7.4%, or 5.7% in constant currency"
"From a product-offering perspective, entry equipment sales was down 6.4%, or 5.5% in constant currency, an improvement in trend reflecting the rebound in developing markets, as well as early benefits from new products offset by continued higher OEM equipment declines"
"Mid-range was down 8.6%, or 7% in constant currency, so relatively weaker, but anticipated given that none of our recently-announced new mid-range workplace products were available in quarter one"
"Lastly, we saw better performance in high-end equipment sales, which were down 6.1%, or 3.7% in constant currency, an improvement from the fourth quarter"
A couple of points to highlight in the high-end
"First, color equipment grew 1% in constant currency; and, second, the growth was driven by the higher end of the portfolio, continuous feed and iGen products"
"Entry production color products were down year-over-year, as we have yet to benefit from the new Versant products we only just announced"
Post sale revenue was down 5.8% or 3.9% in constant currency
"This compares to a decline of 2.9% in 2016. The higher Q1 post sale decline was driven by Managed Document Services, which essentially is our previously reported document outsourcing revenues now expanded to include Managed Print Services within Global Imaging"
"In Q1, Managed Document Services was 33% of our revenues"
It was down 2% in actual currency and up 0.4% in constant currency
"This compares to 2.6% constant currency growth in 2016. The slowdown can be attributed to lower signings in recent quarters within the enterprise space, as well as a challenging compare in Q1 as Q1 2016 Managed Document Services was up 4.9% in constant currency driven by strong equipment growth"
"I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a view which I have already touched on"
"Strategic growth areas in the first quarter grew 1% in constant currency and comprised 39% of our total revenues, a 2 point mix shift from the year ago period"
The growth of 1% did not reflect benefits from our newly launched products and compares to growth of 2% in 2016 with the trend change coming from the Managed Document Services component I just discussed
Jeff highlighted earlier that we made progress in Q1 laying the foundation to drive improvement in strategic growth areas with a target to shift the mix by approximately 3 points this year
"Turning to installs, as expected, color was stronger than black and white"
"We saw improved performance in entry, although a weaker mix given the better developing markets performance where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio"
Mid-range installs likewise were dampened as expected by not benefiting yet from the newly launched products
"And high-end installs were weaker than equipment revenue performance I described earlier as mix improved the stronger performance in the higher-end products like continuous feed and iGen, offsetting install declines in entry production products given product launch timing"
Signings in the quarter of $532 million were down 6% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency
"With that, we did see improvement in new business signings which were up 1% year-over-year at constant currency"
"Signings, as Jeff mentioned, is an area where we are making investments in sales coverage and taking action to drive better results"
I should note that we only have a line of sight to signings in the lower growth large enterprise areas
"So broadly speaking, total Managed Document Services revenue growth outperformed signings as the higher market growth is coming from the SMB area"
The last key measurement I'd like to cover is strategic transformation
This is a critical program to drive both expanding margins and enabling investments to improve revenue trajectory
"We have many projects underway spanning the company and we continue to target $600 million in gross savings for 2017. We took, as anticipated, a fairly large restructuring charge of $120 million in quarter one to position us to achieve our full year gross savings objectives"
"There are headwinds related to revenue declines as well as currency that partially offset these savings, but net-net we anticipate continued margin expansion for the full year"
"Before moving on to cash flow, I'd like to take some time to cover the trends we're sitting at a high level and how we expect them to play out as we progress through the year"
The total revenue decline of 4.3% in constant currency was consistent with 2016 and an improvement over Q4. We continue to expect full year constant currency revenue declines in the mid-single digits with about 2 points of negative translation currency
"From a calendarization perspective, Q2 will face the most challenging year-over-year compare and we won't see a full quarter's benefit from the new product launch"
"So net-net, we'd expect higher declines in Q2 with moderating declines in the second half driven by improving equipment revenue trends"
Operating margin is seasonally weakest in Q1 so we expect improvement in absolute terms as we move through the year supported by our continued focus on our transformation and productivity initiatives
"Transaction currency is dampening some of that improvement and was a negative 110-basis-point year-over-year impact to margin in Q1. At current rates, we expect a slightly higher negative impact in Q2 and more moderate impacts in the second half"
"Lastly, and looking at the trends for adjusted EPS, we are continuing to guide for full year adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.88, which compares to $0.88 in 2016. The drivers of full year 2017 adjusted EPS as we highlighted last quarter are currency and the higher tax rate partially offset by lower interest expense"
"These factors impacted our first quarter results and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through"
I will now shift to discuss cash flow
"Operating cash flow generation coming from continuing operations in the quarter was $190 million, up $103 million year-over-year and free cash flow was $164 million, up $109 million year-over-year"
So a good result driven in part by working capital timing as inventories were a smaller use year-over-year given product launch timing and payables were also a source
"As we indicated last quarter, our operating cash flow guidance of $700 million to $900 million will be about $200 million lower this year than normalized operating cash flow of about $1 billion driven by higher restructuring payments and pension contributions"
"Q1 operating cash flow reflected the higher restructuring payment expectations, $60 million versus $21 million in the prior year"
The pension contributions of $23 million were only a small portion of our guidance of $350 million for the full year
Investing cash flows were a use of $35 million and included CapEx spend of $26 million and $11 million related to a small GIS acquisition
"Cash used in financing was over $1 billion and reflected $1.3 billion in senior note repayments and $87 million in dividends, both common and preferred"
Turning now to the capital structure slide I will spend a few minutes on debt before handing it back to Jeff
"We ended Q1 with $5 billion of debt, which is lower than 2016 ending debt of $6.3 billion reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments I just highlighted"
Two elements made up the repayments
The first was the repayment of $1 billion associated with two senior notes that matured
"In addition, in the quarter we exchanged $600 million of certain senior notes due 2018 through 2020 for $300 million in cash and $300 million in new senior notes due 2022 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.07%"
This transaction in essence allowed us to early retire $300 million in debt and extend out the term of an additional $300 million
"Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.7 billion is allocated to financing debt calculated by a fine of 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $472 million of equipment on operating leases"
This financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage
"So, to summarize, overall a positive start to the year with most operational metrics in line with expectations, putting us on track to meet our full-year guidance"
"With that, I will hand it back to Jeff"
"Hi, Shannon"
This is Bill Osbourn
I'll touch on that
"So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that – both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion"
And the two primary items which you mentioned are the higher pension contributions over that period of time being approximately $100 million-plus higher each given year
"And then also, we were going to have higher restructuring payments each of those two years as we were doing our strategic transformation"
We would expect those to normalize and have a $200 million-plus benefit versus to get to a more normalized $1 billion cash flow in 2019 and beyond
So similar to what we said at year-end both 2017 and 2018 would be dampened by approximately $200 million
"We are working continuously to improve our working capital both from an inventory management perspective, managing receivables, payables, timing, et cetera, and we have some specific projects in place to really focus on inventory management, but the primary things impacting the normalized cash flow are the higher restructuring payments this year and next year, and the higher pension contributions"
"As far as your second part of your question regarding the uses of cash, similar thoughts to year-end"
"Given the $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow we're expecting this year, and our cash on hand on the balance sheet at the end of the year, we projected to have about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash available"
"We're going to pay down incremental $300 million of debt, which we did during the quarter; dividends around $280 million, CapEx we're guiding about $175 million and M&A in the $100 million range"
"That left, if you're doing the math, about $100 million to $300 million that we're evaluating the best uses of, whether that's paying down additional debt, whether M&A opportunities come along, et cetera"
"At this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet"
"Just to follow-on, I was going to say the same thing"
"G&A, clearly, we're looking for areas to cut costs, where we are not going to be impacting future revenue growth, and G&A is one of those areas"
"We've done benchmark analyses and have identified areas that we plan on reducing costs in certain G&A sectors, and that will be clearly an area of focus"
"There are – the reinvestment, clearly is – part of it is offsetting various headwinds from currency transactions, et cetera, but we are also utilizing these savings to reinvest in the business"
"Couple examples would be in – people may not think about it this way, but we are planning on and have been selling more A4s as part of our new product launch, and those have lower margins upfront"
"It's really investing in the business, because you get higher margins over the life of the product due to the post sale revenues, but it is actually an investment getting those machines in field, or MIP, out there, and our goal is to – this year to increase our volume of A4s of our new product launch"
That is one example in particular
"We are investing in systems, as Jeff mentioned, the delivery area"
There are costs there
"Some of it is CapEx, some of it's OpEx, and in some of our back-office IT infrastructure, we're also doing investments to be able to do things more efficiently and cost effective"
"Hey, great question"
"As far as the Fuji Xerox, just to confirm it is a $0.03 impact in our adjusted EPS, so the $0.15 adjusted EPS does include that $0.03 or $30 million charge, or we would have been say it another way, $0.18 without it"
"Clearly, we did not know anything when we gave guidance back in January about this charge when we were setting guidance for the full year"
"With that said, when you go throughout the year, and we update and we do detailed analyses internally projecting for the rest of the year, there are puts and takes that occur and I'm not going to go through all the details of those but one example of that is we give guidance at the beginning of the year and factor in a certain amount of transaction currency headwinds for the year"
"Updated based upon current foreign currency rates, we see that being a couple of pennies less for the rest of the year and that would be something that we factor in to our updated overall guidance analysis"
"So the $0.03 clearly was not expected; however, it is factored into the full year updated guidance now and when we look at other puts and takes that come into play as we update each quarter end and we're reaffirming the $0.80 and $0.88 and knowing that that $0.03 charge is in the Q1."
We're not going to go into really details regarding the Fuji Xerox matter other than what they have disclosed
Fujifilm put out a press release last week that specifically cited a ¥22 billion receivable adjustment
This is our calculated estimate of the impact of that adjustment on our earnings
Fujifilm has stated that they are in the process of an investigation
The ¥22 billion is their current estimate that they put out there
"With that said, as we made in our note in our disclosures that could change, but we are not aware of anything additional at this point other than the ¥22 billion, which we've calculated to have a $30 million impact"
"Hey, Kulbinder"
"A couple of things really from a difficult compare perspective, we're expecting a little bit bigger headwind in Q2 from a transaction currency perspective"
"Also, if you're looking at Q1 last year, we had not fully ramped up our strategic transformation, our restructuring process"
By Q2 that had ramped up; it was in full swing
"So we now have full ramped-up strategic transformation this year in Q2 and in last year in Q2, so that creates a little bit tougher compare"
"And we won't fully benefit from all the products being out in Q2. Most of them will be out in Q2, but it won't fully be there yet"
"So, with that said, we don't give – we're not giving formal quarterly guidance on adjusted EPS, or anything"
"But I think, historically, if you do the math, Q2 has been around 25% of the full year, and it looks to be in that zone for this year"
"The headwinds are really that transaction currency in Q2 this year, which we do, by the way, expect to moderate in the second half of this year"
