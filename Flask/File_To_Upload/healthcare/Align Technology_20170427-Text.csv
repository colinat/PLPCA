Good afternoon and thanks for joining us
"On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter, and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments clear aligners and intraoral scanners"
"John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the second quarter, following that I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions"
"2017 is off to a great start with first quarter revenues, volumes, gross margin, and EPS all above expectations"
"First quarter net revenues were up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign case shipments of 27% year-over-year to a record 38,900 doctors this quarter"
"These reflect the growth from both our North America and international regions and higher than expected teenage cases across the board, which increased 32% year-over-year"
"iTero's scanner revenues increased 47% year-over-year, and were down sequentially as expected"
"For Q1, North America Invisalign case volume was up 8.4% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven primarily by North American orthodontists, with GP Dentists showing improving growth trends"
"Continued strength in North American ortho channel reflects another record quarter for Invisalign utilization, up 12.6 cases per quarter, which includes substantially higher use by teenager patients, a positive indication for market share gains for metal braces"
"In Q1, we expand our adult-focused media buying to target both men and women with specific segment focus"
This new buying target built on the historical strength we have had with adult females while also reaching adult males in a much more pointed way than ever before
"We saw the results of this new media targeting come through in our sales as strength continued with adult females, and also significant growth with adult males choosing Invisalign treatment"
"During the quarter, we launched Invisalign Lite in North America, which was the first introduced in EMEA and includes up to 14 stages of aligners"
"We also begin titling Invisalign Go in North America in Q1 including with some of our dental service organizations, or DSOs"
iGo for short is an aesthetic solution designed to empower general dentists to treat more patients
"iGo creates a simplified approach that guides dentists through identifying, planning and treating aesthetic cases"
"On a year-over-year basis, shipment growth of 20.3% was driven by increased adoption of Invisalign by orthodontists and continued expansion of our GP customer base"
"We continue to make good progress with our DSOs, with Invisalign shipments up nearly 50% year-over-year in Q1, significantly higher than non-DSO practices"
DSOs are leaders in adopting new technology and innovation in dental industry
"They were the first to consolidate practices, automate, processes and drive greater efficiencies in order to scale their operations"
"The next phase in the DSO industry shift will be driven by the consumer and their preference for everything digital, which we have branded DSO 3.0 in our new marketing programs and collateral"
Consumers today want digital experiences to provide them with more insight to the treatment and options and what steps to take in order to achieve a healthy lifestyle
"By leveraging our technologies, iTero scanning, Invisalign treatment plans, progress tracking application, time-lapse features, our DSOs will be able to collect data on their active patients and tailor dentistry and orthodontics the way their patients want to consume it digitally"
"Working together with DSOs, we can help accelerate the industry shift the full digital practices much quicker and more effectively than with other companies"
"As part of our newly formed Americas region, in Q1, we completed the acquisition of our distributor in Brazil, which includes a small team of employees who'll be based in our SÃ£o Paulo offices in Latin America"
"Brazil is estimated to have approximately 1.4 million new orthodontic case starts each year, and employs nearly 20% of the world's dentists"
"As the world's second largest market for cosmetic interventions, Brazil represents a tremendous growth potential for Align and this acquisition will help us establish our leadership position in Latin America and support our long-term growth strategy"
Q1 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 11.4% sequentially and up 41.3% year-over-year
The better than expected sequential increase was driven by growth in both the EMEA and APAC regions
"In EMEA, Q1 volumes were up 38.8% year-over-year"
"We had a record quarter of growth across nearly all country markets as our TFM model continues gaining traction across the ortho channel with Spain, the U.K"
and Germany leading the way
"In Q1, we introduced Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in certain country markets in EMEA and launched Invisalign Go in the UK, France and Germany"
"We also completed the acquisition of our EMEA distributor, which includes opening our first office in the Middle East, which gives us direct access to customers and distribution partners across Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States, the Baltics, Turkey, Monaco, Israel, Cyprus, the Middle East and Africa"
"In Asia Pacific, Q1 volumes were up 45.2% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia, New Zealand"
"In Q1, we launched Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Asia and more than 800 doctors attending the peer-to-peer launch event"
We also held a South Asia forum with a record 200 doctors and participated in New Zealand's Association of Orthodontists forum
"Finally in South Korea, we transferred all Invisalign practices currently managed by our network partner to a direct coverage model"
"This gives us 100% direct coverage of the Korean market, and will enable our team to continue developing the market for clear aligners and help accelerate growth and adoption in the Invisalign treatment"
"Turning to the teen market, for Q1, 49,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, up 11.3% sequentially and 31.6% year-over-year"
North America ortho shipment growth was well above the three year average both sequentially and year-over-year
"International case shipments of teenage patients increased both sequentially and year-over-year as well, with Q1 teen shipments representing about 30% of total teenage cases"
"In Q1, we introduced the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction in certain country markets in Canada, EMEA and APAC"
Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement combines the benefits of the most advanced clear aligner system in the world with features for moving the lower jaw forward while simultaneously aligning the teeth
"This new solution offers a simpler, more efficient and patient-friendly treatment option than functional appliances and without the need for elastics typically use to treat teen Class II patients"
It's not available in the U.S
It's pending 510(k) approval from regulatory
"In Q1, we're excited to launch our new global Made to Move campaign"
This is the first time we've had an integrated campaign approach for consumer and professional audience across all regions
"The multi-channel national consumer campaign will reach potential patients through TV and digital advertising, social media and PR programs"
"Launched first in North America, we'll begin to extend our Made to Move campaign in other key country markets beginning in May"
"While it's still very early, our new campaign is already driving over 40% higher engagement in digital media versus prior media, and followers across Invisalign's social channels were up 13% this quarter"
We're also seeing the effectiveness of the new target audience in media planning
"In Q2, we'll launch a significant push to drive consumer demand and conversion with moms and teenagers"
We will dial up our investment in marketing to moms with a national multi-touch campaign under the Made to Move campaign umbrella
"And in mid-May, we'll launch our national campaign marketing to teenagers"
The national campaign will utilize key social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat and YouTube to raise awareness of clear aligners with custom programming for teens
"In Q1, our scanner revenues increased 46.9% year-over-year and decreased 33% sequentially as expected"
"Given we worked through the backlog for iTero elements from the end of last year, these results are more reflective of a typical capital equipment buying cycle, which is softer in Q1. This past March, at the International Dental Show, IDS we call it, in Cologne"
We had a greater presence and showcased iTero and Invisalign Go and the benefits of the combination with applications such as Invisalign Progress Tracking
We also previewed the time lapse application that provides dentists with the ability to compare scans over time to instantly visualize changes in patient's tooth wear movement and gingival recession
"Overall, positive interest, as we continue to expand our presence among GPs in EMEA"
Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization
"For Q1, total Invisalign case submitted with a digital scanner in North America increased to a record 54.4%, up over 10 percentage points from the same quarter last year, which reflects an acceleration in case shipments with intraoral scanners, especially by North American orthodontists"
"Q1 was our first full quarter supplying clear aligners to SmileDirectClub, and shipments to this new channel were solid"
"At the beginning of the year, SmileDirectClub launched a consumer advertising campaign that has performed well and is extending the message of treatment with clear aligners versus braces"
They've also doubled their network of SmileShops where potential patients can schedule a scan or have 3D impressions and photos taken
"Overall, we remain excited about the long-term potential for the at-home doctor-directed market and working with SmileDirectClub to bring better smiles to more people"
"With that, I'll turn it over â the call to John"
"Thanks, John"
"In closing, I'm pleased with our continued process and execution of our strategic growth drivers"
The dental industry remains healthy and our customers continue to report solid patient traffic in their offices
"I just returned from the AAO meeting in San Diego this week and was excited to see the level of activity in our booth and the interest level in our products, especially for teenagers as we kickoff the summer teen season with our new teen-focused campaign"
"We had 2,000 doctors and their staff visited our booth and 300 attendees participated in our iTero, Iron Records scanning challenge, where an iTero scan was completed in under one minute for the first time in competition"
We will be in Dubai in May hosting our EMEA summit with over 400 customers attending the two day peer-to-peer event
We've got a lot going on in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you at the upcoming financial conference and meetings
I'll now open the call to questions
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
"Hey, Bob, it's a good question"
"(26:05) going into quarter two is unfortunately, we don't do single variable equations around here"
We have a number of things we've done with teens
"And again, we'll make it more complicated as we get into more intense advertising in the second quarter"
"But you mentioned teen challenge, we think certainly had an impact in this sense, I think, some of the changes we've made on Doc Locator in a sense of the specificity of the patient directed into accounts, is part of that also"
"Also our next level partnership parts with customers, which basically takes customers to another level depending upon the share of business that we're going to see or the accelerated growth level that it can provide to us"
"Remember, Bob, when you go back about 75% of the normal orthodontic cases in the United States are teen-based"
"So if you want to do more Invisalign, it's going to be hard to just dip into adults if you really want to increase in that sense and you have to look at your teen business too"
So I'd say those three major valuables is what really we drove from a North American standpoint for teen growth in the first quarter
No
Couldn't separate it
I can't give you â John can help you on the dimensions of it
"But I'd say when you talk about the mandibular advancement, which is a completely different animal than the â like the 15 stage we have for Lite"
"The Lite product fits really well when you think about E5, E10 and now E15. Customers can understand it they can integrate it"
We saw really rapid uptake with that product line
"When you come up with new products in this business like mandibular advancement, the infusion rate into the marketplace is slow"
"You really â you have dentists and orthodontists who want to try the product, they want to see how it works"
They're just cautious on the front-end until they gain confidence with it
"So I mean, mandibular advancement, remember we don't have a 5 and 10-K in the United States yet"
We have to â that will occur later this year
We hope so
But we'll launch it directly around the world
That product is truly a breakthrough
"We have to work hard from a peer-to-peer standpoint to help to promote it, whatever"
But it gives us more credibility again in that teen market than we had before
"But I wouldn't look at significant â I wouldn't look at material numbers from mandibular advancement in 2017 in any way, it will be how fast we can infuse that product in the marketplace"
I'll take the first one
"I give John the second one on this one, Steve"
"On our growth trial on one week wear piece again, it's hard to pull that signal out from the volume noise, I'd call it"
"But what we see is, we're seeing rapid uptake by our orthodontists and GPs on moving to seven day kind of aligner wear"
We're also getting good feedback in a sense that helps them in a close cycle with patients to know that those particular episodes are going to last some time â half the time of when another one was
So it becomes another item in that discussion that's really helpful
"So it's certainly helping us, again, but I can't quantify to the extent of what it is"
As far as the U.S
"and the faster piece that you mentioned before, John will do it, Steve"
"Steve, first of all, I mean you saw our presence at IDS"
We had a strong present at AAO in San Diego
"But I hear your comments like that, one thing I want to make sure is that we're not looking at ourselves as a general dentistry company"
We do clear aligner systems and we do scanners and we don't have the kind of penetration into marketplace we think we should have here and anywhere in the world
And so we'll stay focused on those items
So I don't want anyone to think that we're trying to broaden our wings to become more of a general dentistry company
It's not what â it's kind of in the cards
"I think, what you â when you â Steve, when you look at the Google searches that have really rocketed for clear aligners over the last quarter or so, some heavy investing by SDC and also having invested by us, it's generating a lot of interest from a consumer standpoint in the marketplace"
"More and more, we know we have a strong consumer brand and we'll reach out the consumers who try to drive that"
"But again, I want to emphasize, we're a doctor-directed kind of a product line"
We work through our docs to get these things done and we do want to establish a strong brand identity with consumers as they turn into patients
"At the same time, we don't have a direct-to-consumer kind of model that we're pushing at the moment"
We got to exercise through SDC and our supply for those kinds of things
"I hope â does that help, Steve? Does that make sense to you?"
"Yeah, Rich, I'd say, we announced July last year the SDC relationship that we have"
This caused a lot of turmoil in the industry in a sense of what we did and why we did
We continue to explain to our customer base in the sense of a logic behind that
Their business continues to expand and the market continues to expand
So I think there â I can't tell you that this will ever go away
There's still I would quantify is a large amount of anxiety in the marketplace
I don't think that will change
"What I do find though, Rich, is that customers that do a significant amount in Invisalign and have a good relationship with Align tend to understand this more or accept it more"
"Once it happens and once its stay more in the metals and brackets, I think it'd been more voice for us or more concern than some of our â now that's empirical"
I can't give you any statistics specifically on our customer based on that
"But I â overall, I think as time goes on and the orthodontic market continues to expand as well as the consumer market continues to expand, and the â I think it generates, as we said before, huge amount of business goes for the GPs and the orthos that use Invisalign and we'll continue to recycle patients that don't fit the protocols that SDC has into the current customer base that we have"
"So I just say we have to keep working it, Rich"
If we're not out of the woods in the sense of discomfort of our customers
"But we'll keep driving the same message, we'll keep bringing business into those accounts, to help those accounts grow and hopefully they'll reach a high comfort level over time"
"Thanks, Rich"
"Thanks, Steve"
"Yeah, Steve"
"I think, I mean I saw that too"
It's pretty well presented by ClearCorrect
"I think if you have kind of product that they have, that's a pretty simple way to go to marketplace"
"And so we don't see that changing our strategy because when you look at the sophistication of our product line and how it is directed towards certain malocclusions and the number aligners associated with it, our pricing makes sense in that way"
"But if you're ClearCorrect, I'd say that that was a simple way to go about it"
And I think it makes sense in that into the marketplace
"Jon, that's a great question"
They came back very strong in that sense
"I would say that in this case, we continue to do incredibly well in Spain"
You see us in the U.K
", both from a GP standpoint, orthodontics standpoint continues to grow and we're seeing great strength out of Germany also, France"
"So by country, when I look at that and again I've spent a lot of years over in Europe too, all those countries are so different when you see that kind of acceleration and growth across each one of those countries, the team is executing well on the strategy across all the different cultures"
I honestly would say it's hard to explain exactly what happened in the fourth quarter in EMEA
"I would tell you that internally, we probably did not guess the vacation schedule as well as what happened in Europe"
"And we had some bleed over, obviously, from a case shipment standpoint"
"And I'd say in general, we as a company, we haven't anticipated well the turndown in the holidays in Europe and how that can affect case growth"
"So I think behind your question, Jon, there's â we're executing well over there, we're excited about it"
"Obviously, this expansion that we've done in the Middle East and Russia with this next distributor acquisition is something we know how to do"
We've proven we really can grow from that
I'm confident we can continue to drive some pretty impressive numbers out of Europe as the team continues to execute there
"Yes, Jon, I'd say we think that this is helping to stimulate the whole clear aligner category"
"SDCs, they spend a lot of money, they're very good in a sense of how they advertise"
We see that as we go to marketplace too
So I do think that's a component in the growth of the marketplace right now
"I'd also caution you, Jon, as the other clear aligner companies come in, I don't expect big consumer spend"
These are companies that you normally just sell to orthodontists through their channels or through distribution channels
They're not used to massive consumer advertising campaigns and the associated â expense associated with that
"So I'm not so sure that the next list of competitors, and you can reel them off as much as I can, are going to come into the marketplace with that kind of gunpowder to go directly to consumer"
I don't think the SDC and our model will be broadly duplicated with the next round of competition
EMEA or APAC or
"All right, Jeff"
"Hi, Brandon, it's Joe"
I'd say it's in line to trending up
Maybe slightly stronger than what we thought
I'd say it straight and probably came from like we mentioned DSOs more than anything
And I work with them
So we thought good about the quarter in that sense
"And they're not dramatic, but let's say trending up"
That's always kind of a magic question around the table here is â we do know that we do see an uptick and uses of Invisalign when we sell Invisalign and account
"Usually, that account has already been associated with Invisalign in some way, Brandon"
"So, but we haven't been able to quantify that"
"Sometimes, it's a blip, sometimes it's bigger"
Sometimes it tends to kind of fall back down to the initial line as an Invisalign customer some point
"But we certainly know that once your customer does get an Invisalign scanner, they tend to do more Invisalign cases"
"And frankly, we can bring more power to that customer in the sense of the software and the ease of the use of the product line that we really start to build in with the iTero scanner"
"As far as how many we sell to non-Invisalign accounts, I really don't have that data and I don't think we've kept track of that data at all"
"Well, I mean we're seeing an increase of orthodontic patients through the orthodontists that we track and we talk to, John"
So we do have a healthy orthodontic market behind us
There's no doubt
I think our team expansion shows that we have taken significant share in that area too
"So look, it's wonderful to have a good â a stronger market behind you like that, but this is a story of a strong market and a share shipped at the same time"
"Yes, right on"
"Look, it kind of â John, you led the question really well, I mean it's kind of a story at a DSO level"
"As soon as you join the DSO, it's all about growth, right"
And we're trying to transfer best practices on growth and efficiency across all the different units that they have
"Invisalign is a great story because you can attract more patients with Invisalign, you have a different revenue source and you tend those patients to attract with Invisalign"
"You tend to keep them over time, too"
"And so, we incentivize these customers, we train them as much as we possibly can, with more work to make it as easy to use Invisalign as possible"
And it's worked out well
"Obviously, Heartland has been a good partner for us and several other DSOs that we have out there"
"And it's a good business partnership in that sense, but a lot of work we have to do to work together to get the right advertising in place, demographics from a patient identification standpoint, the training is necessary for each one of those"
DSOs can really help to facilitate that based on a kind of organization that they are
