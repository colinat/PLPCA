Both full-year GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were $1.9 billion or 17 % of revenue
"Throughout the year, we continued to execute on a number of measures to curb operating expense growth, while continuing to invest in R&D in key commercial priorities"
We believe the benefits materialized in both the fourth quarter and full year results
We booked a GAAP-only charge in Q4 of $455 million related to our recent settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma
"Upon effectiveness of this agreement, we've agreed to pay Forward Pharma $1.25 billion plus potential royalties"
"The charge in Q4 represents the portion of the payment attributable to the sales of TECFIDERA during the period April 2014 through December 31, 2016. GAAP other net expense, which includes interest was $48 million in Q4 and $217 million for the full year"
Non-GAAP other net expense was $52 million in Q4 and $222 million for the full year
"In Q4, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%"
"For the full year, both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%"
"Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 217 million for Q4 and 219 million for the full year, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share"
"For Q4, we booked $2.99 on a GAAP basis and $5.04 on a non-GAAP basis"
"For the full year, GAAP EPS was $16.93, and non-GAAP EPS was $20.22, representing a strong 10% and 19% growth year-over-year, respectively"
"During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $651 million"
"We ended the quarter with approximately $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 30% of this in the U.S"
"In 2017, we expect to continue repurchasing shares as part of our previously announced $5 billion share repurchase program"
Let me turn to our full year 2017 guidance
"Guidance this year has a few more moving pieces due to the spin-off of Bioverativ: Our focus on Biogen's 2017 guidance; but also provide additional context on Bioverativ in what we call WholeCo, the combined companies"
I'd refer you to the slides for today's call for reference
There are a couple of items of note before I go into the substance of the Biogen guidance
"First, there will be a stub period for the full month of January, where Hemophilia will be part of Biogen, not Bioverativ"
"Second, our, our GAAP guidance includes the minimum expense we expect to record in 2017 upon the effectiveness of our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma"
The actual charges for this recorded will depend on the outcome of the patent office proceedings in the U.S
"and EU. Third, our guidance does not include any impact from potential corporate tax reform in the U.S"
", repatriation or changes to the Affordable Care Act"
And our plan is based on recent rates for foreign exchange
"Now, let's get into Biogen guidance, starting with revenues"
We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion
"This includes one month of Hemophilia revenues, which equates to approximately $75 million"
"This represents 5% to 7% growth on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for Hemophilia revenues, for both 2016 and January of this year"
"Starting with MS, our plan assumes OCREVUS is approved this year and launches in the U.S"
and Germany in the first half of 2017. We anticipate relatively stable demand for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in 2017 on a global basis
This is comprised of ex U.S
"patient growth, offsetting modest patient declines in the U.S"
"We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline, as the market continues to shift away from the platforms"
"We anticipate continued strong growth from our Biosimilar business, predominantly driven by BENEPALI"
Moving to SPINRAZA
"We're very excited about bringing this therapy to patients, with such high unmet need"
We're assuming the vast majority of SPINRAZA revenue this year will be in the U.S
We're cognizant that there are near-term capacity constraints in the system and the need for patients to secure reimbursement
"So, we expect the revenue uptake to be gradual in 2017. Nevertheless, clearly, the kinetics of the launch are the biggest ambiguity in our outlook"
"Now, moving to expenses"
"We expect upward pressure on cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in 2017, largely due to the increase in royalties related to the sales of SPINRAZA and our Biosimilars revenue becoming a larger portion of the business"
We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales
"We anticipate additional expense driven by advancing our Alzheimer's programs, notably, aducanumab and the BACE inhibitor; as well as the desire to build our pipeline to business development"
"Guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict"
"SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues, a decrease from 2016, driven by the reduction in head count related to the Hemophilia spin and continued diligent focus on improving inefficiencies"
We're re-allocating resources to maintain our leadership position in MS
Ad we have resourced SPINRAZA for an excellent launch
"From a tax perspective, we anticipate our tax rate for 2017 to be largely comparable to 2016. For Biogen, we anticipate GAAP EPS results of $18 to $18.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $20.45 and $21.25. Our shareholders will also benefit from the earnings of Bioverativ"
"As a reminder, eligible shareholders will receive one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock"
"On an apples-to-apples basis, we aim to grow earnings per share for Biogen in the double digits on a pro forma basis"
I'll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing remarks
