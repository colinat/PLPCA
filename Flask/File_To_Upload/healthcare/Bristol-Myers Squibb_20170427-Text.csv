"Thanks, John"
"Good morning, everyone I think it's fair to say we just had an outstanding quarter with strong performance across the company"
"Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up $0.10 over the first quarter of last year"
"We grew our revenue by 12%, with double-digit growth across our key growth drivers"
"Starting with I-O, sales for Opdivo were strong despite a more competitive landscape in the U.S"
for lung cancer
In the U.S
", while we have seen some share loss in lung cancer, our share has shown signs of stabilization in recent weeks"
"Outside lung, we've seen growth in renal, melanoma, head and neck, and bladder"
"Internationally, we've made great progress on access and reimbursement"
Sales were strong across all indications
"From a regulatory perspective, we continue to make progress, mainly the U.S"
"Opdivo approval in bladder, the Japanese approval in head and neck, and the CHMP positive recommendations for bladder and head and neck in Europe"
"We shared important new data from our immuno-oncology portfolio at AACR [American Association of Cancer Research], including overall survival data from Study 67, the TNB analysis from Study 26, and the early data from our IDO inhibitor"
"We also advanced our diversified portfolio with encouraging data from our FGF21 for NASH at EASL [European Association for the Study of the Liver], and we will work with the regulatory authorities to initiate a registrational program as soon as possible"
"We made significant progress from a business development perspective, investing in translational capabilities through deals like GRAIL and Foundation Medicine and broadening our immuno-oncology clinical development program through agreements to study combination approaches with different mechanisms across a range of tumor"
"As I look at the company going forward, I see tremendous opportunity, driven by our industry-leading portfolio and the very best people in the business, all focused on maximizing value for our marketed products and advancing our pipeline"
"Certainly, all of you are focused on our I-O portfolio and our lung cancer program in particular"
This is a key focus for us as well
"The first-line landscape has become very dynamic, and the outlook for this market is continually evolving"
"Our teams have done a great job maintaining our position, and we believe we have the most comprehensive program in first-line"
"I'm sure you'll have questions about our development program in lung, but let me just say here that over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see a lot of important data"
But we are not just a lung cancer company
"Over the next 12 months, we are also anticipating important data readouts for Opdivo and Yervoy in renal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer"
We also have many important opportunities in a range of other tumor types
"This is particularly true with respect to our next wave of I-O assets, with 10 new mechanisms in addition to PD-1 and CTLA-4 in clinical development"
"During the year, we plan to present additional data from first disclosures for many of our next wave I-O assets, beginning at ASCO, where we will show IDO, GITR, and LAG-3. Tom will speak more about all of this in a moment, underscoring the critical importance of translational medicine to the work we are doing here as well as across our other therapeutic areas"
And we are not just a cancer company
This is clear by Eliquis' continued strong performance in the U.S
and other key markets and by the double-digit growth of Orencia and Sprycel
Eliquis has now exceeded $1 billion in revenue in the quarter and is the leading NOAC in the U.S
based on total prescriptions
"And importantly, we are continuing to see warfarin usage decline in terms of new-to-brand scripts, and we expect this trend to continue as the NOAC class expands"
It is also clear by the fact that we will have data to potentially support three registrational starts in the next 12 months in our fibrosis and immuno-science portfolios
"Our fibrosis pipeline includes first-in-class and best-in-class opportunities, with a focus on fibrosis of the liver and lung"
"And we believe our first compound for NASH, PEG-FGF21, has significant potential in an area with great need for new treatments"
"In immuno-science, we are pursuing novel mechanisms to treat a number of different autoimmune diseases, including lupus, RA, inflammatory bowel disease, Sj√∂gren, and others"
"Beyond our strong performance and pipeline, we continue to look at a balanced approach to capital allocation as a key part of our strategy"
"Business development continues to be a priority for us, and we are sourcing external opportunities across the preclinical and clinical areas, as well as building our translational capabilities"
Charlie will talk later about our progress in that area during the quarter
"All-in-all, I feel really good about the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead"
"As John mentioned, we are pleased that Tom has joined our company and is with us here today"
"Tom brings an important mix of experiences to his new position: his deep scientific expertise as a researcher, having led clinical trial design and drug development, primarily in lung cancer; his work as a practicing physician who has treated thousands of patients; his years of collaboration with academia and the larger scientific community; his leadership experience in large organizations, most recently at MGH, where he gained a deep understanding of the payer environment and the importance of value in ensuring access to medicines for serious diseases; and of course, his work as a member of our board for the past few years"
"Taken together, Tom has the experience and energy needed to realize the full potential of our pipeline"
"Here, let me again express my personal gratitude to Francis Cuss for his more than 13 years with our company"
"Francis made significant contributions to our R&D organization during a transformative year for Bristol-Myers Squibb, and I couldn't be more grateful"
"And with that, I will turn it over to Tom"
"Let me just start, and I'll ask Tom to comment on both of your questions"
"On lung strategy, as you heard from me and Tom, we are very comfortable with the fact that we have a very broad approach to first-line lung cancer, a very broad program"
"We are indeed investigating various treatment modalities, including I-O/I-O, I-O/chemo, and as you know, potentially the combination of the two approaches with I-O/I-O coupled with chemotherapy"
"And I am pleased that over just a few months, we have been able to evolve our lung cancer program, taking advantage of ongoing studies and that enrollment has progressed I would say very much in line with our expectations"
"With respect to IDO, the one thing I would say at a very high strategic level is that we see really promising modalities"
"I think the ability to complement external collaborations as we advance internal programs provide, again, in the same spirit, a very broad set of options for us in order to be competitive from a timing perspective at the same time as we develop potentially best-in-class"
But let me ask Tom to give you his comments on both
"Gregg, thank you"
"So from my perspective, let me say that I'm really very happy with the ability that we have to have broadened and strengthened the capabilities on the board"
That's clearly very important for a company like ours
"With respect to what our priorities are, they really have not changed"
"We are, as you have seen today, extremely focused on continuing to execute as well as we have for the short term"
"And we are extremely focused and I am extremely focused on delivering the value of an extraordinarily promising pipeline, which is probably the broadest and the deepest the company has had"
So that's where we are spending our time
"Those are our priorities, and clearly they are mine as well"
"So let me start, and then I'll ask Murdo to give you his comments on Eliquis"
"So first on the settlement with Merck, we think that is an extremely important recognition the strength of our IP estate with respect to immuno-oncology and PD-1s"
"And I think that settlement is critically important, but also it reinforces our perspective that we will continue to vigorously defend our IP across the board, and that clearly is a priority for the company"
It has not changed
"If anything, it actually has become stronger post the settlement with Merck"
"Let me just also say that we also are very focused on Eliquis, and we agree with the significant long-term potential there is in this market"
And I'll ask Murdo to comment on that
"Obviously, before I do that, let me just get back to the IP"
It's clearly an important priority for us
"It's also one that we share with our partner, Ono, and we are working very closely with Ono on any IP-related issue"
"Murdo, on Eliquis?"
"Tim, thank you"
This is Giovanni
"So obviously, a lot has happened in the last 6 to 12 months in first-line lung cancer"
"As I said earlier and Tom reiterated, this is a very difficult disease to treat"
It has evolved very rapidly
"You just think of the data that was released in the last 12 months, and it's clear that our competitive position has changed and continues to evolve"
"My perspective is that today we have the broadest program for first-line development for our immuno-oncology portfolio in lung, and we are extremely focused on executing that program"
"Execution is on track, and I'll let Tom answer you with respect to study design"
"Murdo, why don't you start?"
"And with respect to your question on Eliquis patents, so our composition of matter patent expires February 2023. We have a pending request for restoration of patent terms, which goes until November of 2026."
"Thanks, David"
Let me just start by giving you our perspective with respect to your question on MYSTIC
"And as we've commented before, these are different trials with different molecules and different study design"
We've actually I believe really worked hard to optimize dosing and schedule
So it's very difficult to really speculate on any implications on the results of one study versus the other
Now I'll ask Tom to answer your question with respect to chemotherapy and then provide some context on timing for CheckMate-227.
"Thank you, Tom"
"Again, we are in a very strong position financially, commercially, clinically, and I believe we are well positioned to continue to grow the company and play an even more important role in the lives of our patients"
