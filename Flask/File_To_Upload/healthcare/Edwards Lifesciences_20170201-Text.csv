"Thank you, David"
"We're pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, which contributed to another successful year for Edwards, as we strengthened our financial performance and product leadership across our portfolio"
Robust demand for TAVR therapy continued through the end of the year and better than we forecasted at our December 2016 Investor Conference
"We ended the quarter with total sales of $768 million, an increase of 15% on an underlying basis, and finished the year strong with global sales of nearly $3 billion, representing an underlying annual growth rate of 19%"
And I'm proud to report we invested aggressively to bring new medical technologies to more patients and drive future growth
"In Transcatheter Heart Valves, global sales were $432 million, up 32% on an underlying basis over the prior year"
Growth was led by continued strong adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S
and Japan
"Globally, average selling prices were stable"
In the U.S
", Transcatheter Heart Valves sales for the quarter were $267 million and grew 41% on an underlying basis versus the prior year"
"Once again, overall performance was strong with procedures growing broadly across more than 500 hospitals in both large and small TAVR programs"
The growth continues to be driven by the extraordinary patient outcomes with SAPIEN 3 reported from the PARTNER II trial earlier in 2016. Outside the U.S
", underlying THV sales grew 19%"
"We continue to be encouraged by the strong global adoption of TAVR therapy, particularly outside of Europe, where overall therapy penetration is still very low"
"In Europe, consistent with previous quarters, growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption continued to outpace countries where therapy is more established"
We estimate total TAVR procedure growth in Europe was approximately 15% in the fourth quarter compared to last year
"Our growth rate was lower, as anticipated, due to the impact of lower sales in France"
"As a remainder, we significantly reduced shipments in the third and fourth quarter, while we were negotiating a resolution to the French policy that effectively limited the number of TAVR procedures in 2016. Although the policy was adjusted and we resumed shipments, we estimate fourth quarter sales would have been about $10 million higher absent this interruption"
"Turning to our near-term product pipeline, we continue to expect that our new Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in Europe in the second half of 2017. And we remain on track to receive a CE Mark for our CENTERA system in the second half of 2017. As we discussed at our Investor Conference in December, we continue to believe the global TAVR opportunity will exceed $5 billion by 2021 for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis"
"We believe the prevalence of this disease is large, generating an even greater need for TAVR therapy"
"Additionally, we believe TAVR will benefit the many patients suffering from severe AS, who have not yet been diagnosed with symptoms as well as moderate AS patient populations, representing an opportunity for continued growth beyond 2021. We are continuing to enroll our PARTNER III low-risk trial with the goal to have this randomized trial fully enrolled this year"
"As we announced today, we received FDA approval for EARLY-TAVR, our groundbreaking trial that will study patients diagnosed with severe AS who have not yet developed symptoms"
"Approximately 1,000 patients across 65 centers will be randomized to receive either transfemoral SAPIEN 3 or clinical surveillance"
We're beginning the contracting process with hospitals and expect them to begin enrolling later this year
"In summary, while we exited 2016 higher than we forecasted in December, our 2017 THV sales guidance remains unchanged and we expect to achieve 15% to 20% underlying growth"
"As expected, this represents a slower THV growth rate compared to 2016 and is consistent with our estimate of more than $5 billion TAVR opportunity by 2021. Turning to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, sales for the fourth quarter were $189 million and were down about 4% compared to last year, driven by lower aortic valve sales in the U.S"
Surgical Heart Valve sales were lower primarily due to the impact of SAPIEN 3 and the continued constrained mitral supply
"Globally, our average selling prices were slightly higher due to the growth of our advanced EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system"
"Looking forward, we believe the launches of our new surgical therapies will offset the TAVR impact in 2017. This includes our EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system which is launched in multiple geographies globally and is currently expanding to additional commercial centers in the U.S"
with growing momentum
We also plan to launch our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in Europe and the U.S
This is a first of a newly created class of resilient heart valves that incorporates the advanced RESILIA tissue
"This valve leverages features of the trusted PERIMOUNT family and includes the proprietary VFit technology, which is designed for potential future valve-in-valve procedures"
We believe INSPIRIS addresses the specific needs of active patients and those who would have previously received a mechanical valve
"In summary, Surgical Heart Valve results were below expectations in 2016. However, we believe the introduction of our next-generation platforms to lift overall underlying sales growth to 1% to 3% in 2017. In the Critical Care product group, sales for the quarter were $146 million and grew 3% on an underlying basis"
Our growth was driven by our Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program in the U.S
and developing markets
"As we announced at our Investor Conference, during the quarter, we received a CE Mark for our next-generation advanced monitoring platform, HemoSphere"
"This all-in-one system will provide greater clarity on a patient's hemodynamic status to enable clinicians to make timely, potentially lifesaving decisions"
We anticipate a U.S
"regulatory clearance later this year, and a commercial rollout of the base platform"
HemoSphere is modular in design and we will later add Enhanced Surgical Recovery capabilities in the future
"And, we remain on track for a 2017 European launch of our Acumen HPI software suite with our new FloTrac IQ Smart Disposable"
This is a first of a kind hypotension or low blood pressure probability indicator during monitoring
"In 2017, we continue to expect our Critical Care underlying sales growth to be between 5% and 7%"
"Now, for an update on several of our new transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies"
"Last week, we were pleased to announce that we completed the acquisition of Valtech Cardio, the developer of the Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of mitral and tricuspid valves"
We're in the process of welcoming and integrating this talented team to Edwards
"Our 2017 financial guidance provided at our Investor Conference in December included the expected financial impact of this transaction, which Scott will discuss in a few minutes"
"As a reminder, the mitral application of Cardioband has received a CE Mark in Europe and we're building a European field organization to begin training heart teams to perform this therapy"
"Additionally, prior to close, Valtech received a conditional approval to begin an IDE trial of Cardioband in the U.S"
We're now assessing the trial design and expect enrollment to begin later this year
"The Cardioband System for tricuspid regurgitation is in a CE Mark trial, which we expect to be fully enrolled in 2017. In the Edwards CardiAQ program for transcatheter mitral replacement, we are focused on transseptal delivery"
"As we indicated during the Investor Conference, we're implementing key clinical learnings sequentially from our U.S"
early feasibility study
"Consistent with this approach, we recently paused enrollment in our clinical trials to perform further design validation testing on a feature of our valve"
"If we see positive results from the test, we expect to resume clinical trial enrollment in the second quarter"
This pause also postpones the start of our CE Mark trial
We continue to gain early clinical experience with our PASCAL transcatheter mitral repair system in compassionate cases
"We're also gaining experience with Edwards FORMA, our spacer for treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, and are developing a larger spacer that would enable treatment of a broader group of patients"
You can expect further updates from clinicians on these new structural heart programs at upcoming major medical meetings
"And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott"
"Thanks, Scott"
"In conclusion, we're very pleased to achieve strong financial performance and significant progress on transformational new therapies across our businesses in 2016 and expect continued growth and progress in 2017. We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of catheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients in need, which positions us well for the long-term"
We believe our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to both healthcare systems and shareholders
"And with that, I'll turn it back over to David"
"Thanks, David"
", I think we would broadly say that share positions compared to the last couple of quarters have been pretty flat"
"I think we had a share gain versus the prior year, but they probably have been pretty comparable here over the recent past"
"If you go to Europe, I think your assessment is correct that if you take the French situation out, market shares once again were pretty stable"
"Overall, sort of the new competitors are accounting for something in the mid-teens of market share, so not a lot moved other than France"
"Well, yeah, thanks, David"
They're both really important
"So, market development is probably more near-term and more important"
"As we indicated at the Investor Conference, we're penetrated maybe at the – our estimate was the 18% level and that that needed a move to something like to 30% level by 2021. So, for us to make sure that we're doing our work to properly make sure that physicians and patients have the best information is really important and we're focused on that"
We're building that organization and we're building that capabilities
"But separate from that and you know we're long-run guys, we're engaged in wanting to study this group of patients that have not yet demonstrated symptoms"
We're firm believers that people with severe aortic stenosis are really at risk and we're prepared to do the clinical study to test that
"We won't get our results for a while, of course, but we think it could be very meaningful once you get out into the future, probably beyond 2021."
Yeah
"Thanks, Bob"
"Yeah, that's a really good point and a good question"
"Frankly, we don't know a lot about this group of patients"
We're really looking forward to learning much more about it
"So, the real answer to your question is unknown"
"There are number of physicians we talked to that speculate that although the patients have previously been diagnosed with no symptoms that once they're on a treadmill, they might indeed have symptoms, which would mean that they would be candidates for the therapy in the near-term to either maybe if they're in intermediate risk to be treated commercially or if they're at low-risk to potentially go into the PARTNER III trial"
"Yeah, thanks, Bob"
I can't say there were any real surprises
It was pretty much as we expected
I will tell you the very end of the year finished stronger than we anticipated would
"We did an estimate at the time of the Investor Conference never being too sure how it's going to turn out around the holiday period, and it – that turned out stronger than we thought"
"But other than that, I thought it went very much as we anticipated"
Yes
"So, that share that we lost are those that $10 million probably went completely to Medtronic"
"Of course, our intention is to try and win those customers back, that's the goal of that, but hard for us to estimate if we can get that all back and how soon that might happen, that certainly will be our intention"
But we – that's in front of us to do
They actually switched over into some core valve cases during that period
"So, we've got some work to do"
"Second question, Michael, tell me again what your question was about our growth rate?"
"So, yeah, we think the 15% to 20% is right on"
"When we put that estimate in place at the time of Investor Conference, there wasn't a lot that we learned since that time, so we think that that is a good estimate and we would encourage you to think about that as you think about our growth rates"
"In terms of CardiAQ, I'll just refer you back to what we said"
We said that we are engaged in this and we've been going through this process where we tried to very thoughtfully make sure that we learned from all of our clinical experiences
"And we saw something that we decided we wanted to – and this is again totally voluntary, go back and take a look at"
"And so, we're running some internal tests associated with that to make sure that we feel comfortable moving forward"
We're doing this in complete cooperation with our clinical investigators
"The teams continues to be very positive, but it's just a step that we're going to go through"
It's a bit of a signal of just how early this therapy is
"We're still on our pretty steep learning curve across the board, we're seeing the learn in every case not only something about our device, we learn something about the procedure, something about imaging, and something about anticoagulation, and we're trying to apply all those learnings as we go"
"Let me try and walk you through it, Larry, and if I miss something, we'll come back to it"
"We were not saying that the CE Mark is off for 2018, it's still possible for us to get that"
We'll keep you informed of all the developments
We're just pausing enrollment
And that's not really unexpected for something at this early stage and transformative
"Your second question about how we're going to perform in France, we would hope that we would do well"
"France is a growing market and we would hope to regain some, if not all, of that share during 2017. So, to your question of why was Q3 different than Q4, during Q3, people were still working off inventories and in Q4 they felt the full brunt of the effect"
"And so, I think it's just that simple"
"Finally, your question was about Cardioband, we're early in this process"
"This only closed – what, a week ago"
"And so we're putting together a separate field organization in Europe, that's a combination of the team from Valtech and Edwards and we're getting ready to take the field"
"So, I don't have much more to report at this point, but we'll keep you posted, and each quarter we'll share with you our progress on sales"
Let me try and we can talk about it
"Yeah, I think we saw the potential there in Q2. In Q3, we realized that it was a serious situation and we discontinued our shipments at that time"
And I think we told you at that time that it was going to have impacts in both Q3 and Q4. I think the Q4 impact probably turned out to be a little larger than we thought
"So even though we reached resolution during the fourth quarter, it turned out a little larger than we thought, but that's kind of the way that it played out"
Is that clear?
Sure
Yeah
"At this point, I'm not sure that this is worth detailing"
"We're adding some senior leadership that will bring some more experience, Edwards people that have experience with therapy adoption in other fields"
"Beyond that, we're going to use actually a host of different, I will call it methods to be able to drive education and therapy adoption"
", it will be largely web-based, there will be – there is a lot of actually telephone conversations, and direct contact, and seminars in Europe and Japan that seem to be effective"
"So, there is going to be a variety of tools that are applied, and we'll try and be a little bit more granular for you as time goes on"
Yeah
"So, it's designed to be a superiority study"
It is randomized
"We expect it to have a two-year composite endpoint, and the endpoint is likely to include death, stroke, and rehospitalization"
"We're going to randomize it between SAPIEN 3 and clinical surveillance, and I think it's going to have about 1,000 patients in it"
Yeah
"I hear you well, Jason"
"Without getting into specifics on Japan, I think there are just two companies approved in Japan and we're fortunate last year that we had SAPIEN 3 approved"
And we've been really pleased at the way that the therapy is being adopted in Japan
"If you'll recall, we got off to kind of a slow start a couple of years ago and there were a number of structural elements that were obstacles"
"But at this point, we feel like much of those have been cleared"
"I think, we're probably headed – maybe around 100 accounts in Japan and we continue to think that that has a total addressable opportunity of $300 million to $400 million"
"Well, we think, there's reasons to be conservative"
"We think, across Europe, it's been many years since this technology has been adopted"
"We expect the market's probably going to grow a little faster than Edwards that will lose a little bit of share, probably both in Europe and the U.S"
"So, I ask you to keep that in mind when you think about how realistic the 15% to 20% is"
We think that's a pretty good estimate and not that conservative
We don't think so
"We give our centers that are involved, for example, with us on the PARTNER trials an opportunity to enroll in the EARLY-TAVR, and we think it's been probably in excess of 90% of those centers have said that, yeah, they're interested and they feel like they do have the bandwidth to do that"
The good news is they have infrastructure in place that they can leverage
So that's helpful
And this really is a new group of patients that they haven't addressed before
So we believe that they can handle it
"We got a lot to learn, though, because this is a new field for us"
It is fair to look at it
"We have some efforts in place and we're proud of those, but we think we're still relative novices at this and growing"
"So, we'd like to think we'd have – we'd be more effective in the future"
Yeah
"So, as we've indicated, we expect to get the CE Mark by the end of the year and we expect it to be based on data that probably is presented at EuroPCR meeting in May"
"So, I think that's going to be a good chance for you to get a look at that, Matt, and be able to judge what kind of a therapy that is"
"Even though, the Valtech is new to Edwards, we also are excited about Cardioband for tricuspid regurgitation"
"And they tell us they've got some pretty good momentum, so we believe that that CE Mark trial could be enrolled by the end of 2017."
I don't have any update on that one
"We'll keep you tuned in, Matt, and we'll need to let other people ask questions, thanks"
"We – I think, your point's a good one"
"We think if they have – if they show good results, that's only a positive for patients, not only it helps transcatheter aortic valve replacement therapy as a total class"
"And so, we actually hope that they're successful in treating these patients and we'll be anxiously awaiting the results like you"
"Yeah, there are a number of things about the Cardioband that we find attractive, but there's also opportunities for improvement"
"And yeah, absolutely, one of them is to shorten procedure times"
"Those can be really very lengthily and tedious, and we have a number of ideas that the R&D team has to be able to shorten this procedure time"
And so that's going to be one of the key areas of focus for us as well as to try and put some engineering into the system to improve reliability and take out cost
"Yeah, I'm not going to speculate"
There's really a broad range of things that could happen from where we are right now
"Just to be clear, we just suspended clinical enrollments"
We didn't really pause the whole program
And I don't know that pausing is that unusual for this sort of an early stage in transformative technology
"As I tried to relate earlier, we're on a steep learning curve and to place a valve in the mitral position is a tough task and to do it well"
The valves are large
The pressures are high
The anatomy is very complex
There are very serious imaging challenges
There's coagulation challenges
And so we're on a steep learning curve and we're very pleased at the pace that we're moving at
We just decided on this feature that we were going to pause this while we're going through our own internal tests
So we'll keep you tuned in
And we're hopeful that it's positive and that we'll be back rolling again in the second quarter
So I'll tell you my understanding and then again I'm not an expert
"And I think, collectively, the clinical community is going to learn something as well"
These are patients again with severe aortic stenosis
So someone has done an echo or an ultrasound on this patient and found that their valve is closed
"So typically, it starts out with a murmur"
They get a diagnostic echo
That echo says that they have severe aortic stenosis
But their physician does not diagnose symptoms
So I think the first step of the clinical trial actually is to put this patient on a treadmill in addition to a number of other diagnostic tests
And so this would be the first interesting test
"And then ultimately if they show no – demonstrate a lack of symptoms, they'd be randomized between getting a transcatheter aortic SAPIEN 3 by femoral delivery or just clinical surveillance"
We don't have a good sense
"When we did our early estimates, we felt that there may be as many asymptomatic or patients without symptoms as patients with symptoms"
"Again, that's what the clinical community would estimate"
And we believe that a lot of those patients are probably out of the system
"Now, there are also a number of hospitals that tell us that they actually have groups of patients that have no symptoms that they could name names on"
"So again, we're going into a bit of uncharted territory, Ben, and we'll keep you tuned in on what we learn"
"So if you're to say what we think is going to happen in Europe, in the U.S"
"; we think that the number of procedures would be down slightly, so down a few percent in terms of the total number of procedures done in Europe or done in the U.S"
"And that again is of surgical isolated aortic procedures, right"
We expect that we offset that decline through our new products
"So through new products and share gain, that our sales would actually grow 1% to 3%"
"Well, some of it, I suppose you would say, turns out in price"
"So for example, when a physician chooses to use an INTUITY Elite valve instead of a Magna Ease valve, the value that they would impart would be higher to Edwards"
"Obviously, you're getting a higher value"
"So you'd see that, I suppose, in the price relationship"
But the other part might just be share gain associated with our products that are best-in-class and we're the market share leader on
"Thanks, Matt"
It's not unusual if you go out there to speak to surgeons to find some that have a lot of confidence in their own ability to do great surgery on intermediate-risk or low-risk patients
We really don't find that as a surprise
The surgeons that are already on heart teams at TAVR centers seem to really understand the value of the therapy
And those referral processes seem to go much better
"When you're in hospital systems where there is no TAVR and only surgical valve replacement is available, probably those surgeons are less – probably understand less the value of TAVR and the importance of TAVR"
"So it's part of probably our system moving a little slow, probably not a big surprise to us"
That's in our estimates
We know that it's going to take some time and it'll be a cumulative sort of weight of the data that'll ultimately influence them
We're really pleased that we have powerful data in PARTNER I and PARTNER II
We've got PARTNER III right behind it and then EARLY-TAVR right behind that
So we're going to bring big powerful studies that are highly scientific to bear and ultimately we think the weight of that data will carry the day
"As you know, no two sites are alike"
"But I would say broadly that we really have not seen structural roadblocks, that sites have had an amazing ability to add capacity and cases per day"
"And in some cases, it's been pretty significant that they're able to do even four cases a day with SAPIEN 3. So they get a pretty good capacity bump out of it"
"And so, no, structurally, I really don't think that's the core issue"
"So, yeah, I don't remember the exact numbers"
But I want to guess that it's around 50 centers that we added during 2016. Gives you a sense of what we've done
And then your question about transapical was on which system?
"So, yes, indeed, we are moving forward with the transapical system as well"
"When we adopted that CardiAQ, one of the things that we found attractive is that we could have one valve with two delivery systems"
"And so, yeah, that is an important element"
"In terms of number of centers in 2017, is that TAVR centers that you're asking about?"
"So 2017, we're likely to get some growth"
"We expect that to probably slow some, not to be as big as the growth in 2016. There are still centers that are interested in joining, but we expect that to be at a reduced rate"
It's hard for me to estimate just what that would be
Sure
Yeah
"So, yeah, there have been some new products"
"But overall, there hasn't been a big change that we've observed over the past several quarters"
The new competitors are still having some impact
"I think, total, they're in the mid-teens sort of level of market share"
"And outside of what happened in France, we haven't seen a lot"
ASPs have been very stable across Europe
"So again, you know that we're selling at a premium and sometimes that premium's quite large"
It could be even larger than 20% in some places
"But there's no significant changes in the market dynamics, Joanne"
Yeah
"You know what, I think the quarter turned out pretty much the way that we expected to"
It was maybe a little bit stronger than we thought based on how the year closed out
I don't know what to tell you about that
Our 29 millimeter valve serves most sizes of patients
And so we don't really feel like we lose patients in that regard
And that a large-size valves is already factored into our guidance
So there was really nothing new there
"Yeah, thanks"
I know it must be frustrating
"But we really would like to steer you away from just isolating, looking at just the risk factors"
"As we tried to talk about it at our investor conference, there are a number of factors the heart teams take into consideration, which include risk or – but certainly everything about their – the anatomy of these patients and the frailty of these patients"
And so it is multi-factorial and it's done by these multi-disciplinary teams
I'd encourage you to go broader
"We feel like there's about 650,000 patients out there with severe aortic stenosis and the treatment rate right now is around 18%"
And so our job is to see if we can improve that and improve the lives of these patients and our performance as well
"Well, I'm not intimately familiar with it"
It sounds like that's real world and that reflects what patients go through
"And so I would say typically when a surgeon opens a patient, they are going to consider from time to time are there other things that they should do because this is a pretty big procedure to take a patient through and they're not going to miss the opportunity to do more"
"So I think that when it's all done, it probably is a realistic comparison of what goes on in the real world"
"Our thinking really hasn't changed dramatically on this, Chris"
We continue to feel that with the stroke rate that's as low as it is – and you saw what the stroke rate looked like for a SAPIEN 3. They're in the neighborhood of 1% at 30 days
That adding another delivery system and another catheter potentially adds as much risk as it erases
"And so for the additional cost and risk associated with it, we have a tough time endorsing that therapy"
Yeah
I couldn't be more proud of the way that we assess stroke risk in our trials
I don't know if you recall what happens
"But we actually have a neurologist, not a cardiologist, but a neurologist do an assessment before the procedure"
And then they do the follow-up assessment
So you have a neurological assessment by somebody that's detached from this and they're highly qualified to be able to assess stroke risk
"Now, if you would compare it to an MRI, we'd argue that that is sub-clinical often"
So we think that our trial has probably some of the best and most robust data generated related to stroke
"Okay, well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards"
"Scott, David and I welcome additional questions by telephone"
"And with that, I'll turn it back over to David"
