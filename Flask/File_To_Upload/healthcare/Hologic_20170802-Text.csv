"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone"
We're pleased to discuss Hologic's performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted solid results overall and delivered on our near-term financial commitments
"Revenue exceeded our guidance, and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at the high end of our forecast"
Our molecular diagnostics and international businesses continue to emerge as strong growth drivers
And our recently acquired Cynosure business performed in line with our quarterly expectations
"From a longer-term perspective, our quarterly results reflect positively on our efforts to revitalize and reshape our business portfolio"
"If you could have listened to our strategic planning discussions back in 2015, when our domestic Breast Health business was driving tremendous growth, we knew that we needed molecular and international to accelerate when breast inevitably slowed"
"And that is exactly what has happened, as we upgraded leadership and made the necessary investments"
"This quarter, in fact, both business, international and molecular, posted double-digit growth, results that would've seemed unlike even a year ago"
"But while we were working to establish new growth drivers in molecular and international, we were also ramping up R&D in all our divisions to ensure that we could generate sustainable organic growth for years to come"
"Several of the new products that resulted, like the Affirm prone biopsy system and MyoSure REACH, are making increasing contributions to growth"
"This quarter, for example, sales of new products exceeded $40 million globally, although obviously this is not all incremental"
"And other new products are emerging, some of which we'll discuss today"
"But, before doing that, let's provide a brief overview of our third quarter results"
Reported revenue of $806.1 million grew 12.4% on a reported basis or 13.1% in constant currency
"Margins were solid based on continued price discipline and solid expense control, which led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. EPS declined by 2.0% compared to the prior-year period, a small amount considering the comp included a full quarter's contribution from our divested blood screening business"
"So we are doing an effective job of filling that earnings hole with gains in our base business, as well as Cynosure"
"If you were to back out blood screening and Cynosure, core revenues grew 2.4% on a reported basis or 3.1% in constant currency"
"Similarly, core EPS would've increased 11.9% if you excluded blood and Cynosure"
So we continue to show good leverage up and down the income statement
"So while it was a solid quarter overall, we plan to do better"
"At Cynosure, our efforts to stabilize and strengthen the domestic sales force are underway under new leadership, and our R&D remains highly productive"
"And in Breast Health, we are excited about new claims for our Genius 3D mammograms, new insurance coverage, and new products that we're launching now, which we will discuss for the first time today"
"With that introduction, now we'd like to discuss some third quarter revenue highlights, focusing on molecular diagnostics, international, Cynosure, and Breast Health"
"Then I'll hand the call over to Bob to cover other revenues, expenses, and our updated guidance"
"First, growth in the quarter was led by molecular diagnostics, where global sales of $144.1 million increased a very healthy 10.3%"
The story here is very similar to prior quarters
"In the United States, where sales grew at a high-single-digit rate, our commercial team is doing an excellent job of cross-selling our full product portfolio, increasing market share and utilization of our fully automated Panther system, and expanding the market by driving compliance with testing guidelines"
"In addition, this quarter we gained FDA clearance for our Aptima assay to detect herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. While the molecular herpes market is not huge, our new test is an important addition to the Panther women's health menu and a nice incentive for new customers to try out the system"
Outside the U.S
", where molecular sales grew more than 20% for the fourth time in five quarters, we continue to see the benefits of new leadership, healthy Panther placements, and multiple new-product introductions, including our viral load assays"
"And we recently received a CE Mark for our new Panther Fusion system, which provides lab customers new capabilities and enables them to further consolidate testing on our platform"
"We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are on our way to building an international molecular business that rivals the leadership position we've established domestically"
"Beyond molecular diagnostics, we are very pleased with the continued growth and positive evolution of our international business as a whole"
"More than a year ago, we said this business felt like a start-up and told you that building the foundations for sustainable growth would take some time"
"But we laid that groundwork in a very deliberate way, starting with new leadership"
"Now, for the second consecutive quarter, international sales grew low double digits, excluding blood screening and Cynosure"
"While we are still early in the game, we are clearly putting points on the board and are encouraged by our progress"
One reason we are feeling good about international is the breadth of our performance
"In recent quarters, molecular diagnostics and surgical led the charge, but this quarter, every business except Skeletal posted solid growth"
"In particular, I want to highlight the progress made in international Breast Health"
"As a reminder, in all four quarters of our fiscal 2016, that business declined"
"In the first quarter of this year, it was flat; then it grew at a mid-single digit rate in Q2. This quarter, international Breast Health grew in the low teens, reflecting our efforts to optimize channel strategies and strengthen our commercial capabilities"
The third area I'd like to discuss is Cynosure
"Our view of Cynosure continues to be very optimistic over the long term, though still cautious in the near term"
Cynosure posted revenue of $110 million in its first full quarter as part of Hologic
"This was much higher than in the second quarter sequentially, and in line with our quarterly guidance"
There was a lot to like about Cynosure's performance in the quarter
"First, we are pleased with sales of skin-related products, especially PicoSure"
"Second, overall international sales grew significantly compared to the prior year"
"Third, sales of consumables increased at a low-teens rate, driven by dramatic growth in SculpSure PAC keys, which illustrates the value that our product is providing in the field"
"And, fourth, we made important progress in new product development"
"But at the same time, it's clear that we can improve Cynosure's commercial execution in the United States, just as we did at the larger Hologic three years ago"
"As we discussed last quarter, there's been a considerable amount of disruption in the U.S"
"sales force, and newly hired reps are still getting up to speed"
"To tackle this challenge, we have named Kevin Thornal as Division President of Cynosure"
"I've personally known Kevin, who engineered the remarkable turnaround in our European Breast Health business over the last year or so, since our years together at Stryker"
"He is a strong, commercially focused leader who we're confident will have Cynosure growing again in 2018. Kevin replaces Michael Davin, who will be retiring on September 1. Michael built Cynosure into the world's leading medical aesthetics company, and we thank him for remaining with Hologic during the integration process to share his expertise and knowledge"
"Longer term, we remain enthusiastic about the value of the aesthetics market, as well as Cynosure's ability to lead it"
Nothing has changed in terms of the positive market backdrop
"With the changes we are making, we are now in an excellent position to capitalize on these tailwinds, with a broad portfolio of differentiated products, the commercial expertise and backing of Hologic in areas like direct-to-consumer advertising, and a robust R&D pipeline"
"As evidence of this last point, we received FDA clearance ahead of schedule this quarter to use SculpSure, our non-invasive body contouring product, to treat the back and thighs"
"In addition, we have filed for regulatory clearance to use SculpSure in what's called the submental area, under the chin"
"This is a significant market opportunity that should boost growth in 2018, as we believe our laser technology provides an advantage over the competition"
"And, finally, we have filed for clearance of an innovative new radiofrequency platform, which over time will have applications in aesthetic, women's health, and surgical markets"
"Now we'd like to turn to our fourth subject, Breast Health"
"In the third quarter, global Breast Health sales of $283.7 million increased a modest 0.9% in constant currency"
"business declined 1.7%, while international sales increased 13%"
"In the United States, incremental placements of 3D gantries declined, like in recent quarters, as the time required to close deals has increased due to market and competitive dynamics"
"But at the same time 3D units increased sequentially, booking trends remain solid, our backlog is healthy, we still have roughly half our installed base to upgrade, and we remain a net market share gainer"
"In addition, other drivers of growth continue to emerge within Breast Health"
"For example, service revenue again benefited from an expanding installed base in the United States, delivering more than $100 million in sales"
"Revenue from our interventional products also increased nicely, as we are doing a better job of selling our full portfolio"
"Finally, sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continued to build"
"In addition to these positive trends, several other factors give us confidence that our domestic Breast Health business will grow in 2018. First, this quarter we earned important new labeling indications that will broaden our competitive advantage"
"Our sales representatives can now say that Genius mammograms are the only mammograms clinically proven to detect 20% to 65% more invasive cancers than 2D alone, with an average increase of 41%"
"In addition, only Genius mammograms are FDA-approved as superior to 2D mammography for routine screening of the nearly 50% of women who have dense breasts"
This is meaningful because more than 30 states now have laws requiring women to be notified of their breast density
"Second, we made significant progress on reimbursement during the third quarter"
"Approximately 85% of American women in our target patient population now have incremental insurance coverage for 3D, which we believe will solidify even broader market adoption over time"
"And third, we expect sales of new products to continue to build as we move into 2018. Revenue from our Affirm prone biopsy system is healthy, and we expect to launch Brevera, our innovative new biopsy system, around the end of our fiscal year, so our interventional portfolio is well-positioned for long-term growth"
"Finally, we wanted to share for the first time that we are in the process of launching our first two new mammography systems since 2011. These new products will enable us to further segment the market and extend our competitive leadership position"
"Our new 3D Performance system, which has been launched globally, provides the superb image quality that customers have come to expect from Hologic, but with workflow capabilities and throughput that are geared toward smaller, lower-volume customers"
"In addition, at the high end of the market, the best just got better"
"Our new 3Dimensions system delivers the industry's fastest, highest-resolution breast tomosynthesis exam, plus a wealth of additional improvements"
"These include a better patient experience using the SmartCurve breast stabilization system; superior image clarity from our fastest and highest-resolution detector; and faster, better 2D images from improved software and machine learning algorithms"
"The 3Dimensions system has been launched overseas, where customers are giving it positive reviews, and we expect to introduce it domestically in the coming quarters"
"So, behind the scenes, our R&D team in Breast Health has been highly productive, and we look forward to these products adding to growth in coming quarters"
"Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we are pleased to have met our financial obligations in the quarter"
We expect molecular diagnostics and international to be increasingly important growth drivers in our portfolio and have lots of new product innovation on the way to improve growth at both Cynosure and in Breast Health
So we believe we are well-positioned for the future
Now I will turn the call over to Bob
"Yeah Dan, in simple terms, it probably is a little head-scratcher"
"At the end of the day, international came in a lot stronger than we expected, and the U.S"
was frankly disappointing
And it says we've got more work to do
"And I'll give it to you this way: Obviously when we did the acquisition, we knew there'd been a lot of sales force disruption in the quarter right before we bought it"
"That leadership team at Cynosure had a long track record, and they said at the start of the quarter they thought things were settling down, and they gave us a number that they thought they would deliver for the quarter"
"At the end of the day, we came up short in the quarter"
"I wanted to give them one quarter to let them prove that they were back on track, and at the end of the day, they fell short"
So we're making changes
"We've just installed a new President, and I think – so what we will see here in the third quarter is, because international has gotten stronger and there's a normal seasonal slowdown, I think what you're going to see is that seasonal slowdown in July and August internationally is particularly soft in Medical Aesthetics"
"So I think we see it being a step back before we really start to step forward again, as we go"
"And I will tell you, I feel really, really good about the commercial leader we've put in to run that business now"
"But also want to give him a little air cover while he gets his feet on the ground, because there's always a little disruption in that change"
So it's really a – call it a one quarter step back
"I think we showed we at least know what we're doing by delivering on the – frankly at the low end of what we had hoped for in the quarter, but feeling great about international, great about the pipeline, and we do have some work to do in the U.S"
"No, it was run rate"
There was no end-of-quarter discounting
"If anything I would tell you, frankly, the end of the quarter was probably a little disappointing, which – in its own way"
We might have thought we would have done even a little bit better than where we came in there
So that's what precipitated the change
But I think – suffice it to say orders – it's not like we've carried in a bunch of orders either or anything into this quarter
"In an ideal world, they would've been running hot, and we might have even been able to carry some or whatever into this quarter"
We aren't able to do that
So it is a complete U.S
sales execution issue
We don't break out the U.S
/international piece
"I would tell you, we are much more excited about the performance internationally than we imagined, and it really is a very isolated issue that we know how to fix"
"As a reminder, by the way, Kevin Thornal, who we've just put in as Division President – he's the guy we sent over to Europe 18 months ago, when, many of you remember, our European and especially our global Breast Health business was a disaster"
And that business within 18 months of him arriving is now growing at double-digit rates
He's completely put that business back together again
Kevin and I have a long history together at Stryker
"He came over to Hologic about three years ago, first into the U.S"
"Breast Health business, has gone over there"
"And I would tell you, I'm incredibly excited about what he's going to bring to the business"
But he's not going to work magic this quarter
"Yeah, Dan"
I'd add one last piece
A year ago everybody thought international was a mess
Now it's a double-digit grower
"We look at this and say, you know what? Been there, done that"
We'll absolutely be back to great growth rates in this business
We're not going to give exact guidance for 2018 yet on this call
Cynosure will grow in 2018. There is no doubt
"You know what? We typically are going to assume a six- to nine-month ramp for new reps and new businesses, and I think that would be an appropriate piece here"
So I think – my hunch is this coming quarter is probably the bottom and we start to rebuild even by the end of this quarter
"So as we go into calendar year 2018, ought to be looking pretty good"
"We obviously track internal performance metrics, nothing we're going to share externally"
Yeah
I think less – there's always been the price competition
We're still maintaining pricing and not going down that rabbit hole
"I think GE has gotten a little more aggressive with their new system just in terms of marketing and activity, but we still feel very good about the ongoing trajectory"
I think this is probably a low single digit grower for us as we go into 2018. And we'll certainly aspire to more
"But I think just given where we are in the market life cycle as we go into that kind of second 50% of our installed base and further down to the market, that it's just smaller customers, smaller orders"
"It's probably a bit of both, Tycho"
I think they certainly had the tremendous run with the initial launch of SculpSure
So we are going against comps when they were growing at the 20%-plus level
We still think this is a high-growth market over time
"But going against those particularly high comps when it was all the capital going in, you're probably dealing with a little bit of that"
But overall we continue to feel great about the market dynamics and know that we can have a better commercial execution as we go forward
"Frankly, on both sales, but also marketing"
"I mentioned in the script direct-to-consumer marketing, we're actually just beginning some direct-to-patient marketing programs that they've lacked as a company to date"
There'll be more hiring
There'll be more hiring
We still have some opportunities
"And just managing them – the other piece I'd give you is, we've all seen companies kind of go from that 0 to 400, 500 range, and then you kind of start to – can stumble a little bit as you go to that next level, and sometimes you need some new leadership to take it to that level"
And I think it's exactly what we need on the commercial side
So there will be still a few more changes as we go forth and bringing in more people
"Yeah, it's really for Kevin to get into"
"Kevin is one of the greatest sales and commercial leaders you'll find, just as he went over to Europe, and it starts by getting to know the key people and the key opportunities and then repositioning and making sure we get the right people against the right opportunities"
"It's going to be blocking and tackling and nothing – no whiz-bang stuff, but a lot of basics"
Frankly we're seeing that sales training is a huge opportunity
There's a lot of just basic things where they'd hired a bunch of people that don't even necessarily – haven't been trained on the full line of products
"It's a lot of stuff that's not pretty, but it collectively creates great performance"
And that's the kind of stuff I'm sure Kevin's going to get into
", there's probably not a lot of share to keep gaining"
We do think there's still some market expansion opportunities
"One of the things we haven't talked as much about probably, Isaac, is trying to get more testing done to guideline, where frankly there are more tests that can be prescribed in various situations, and we're trying to get more of that done"
The huge certainly market share gains are outside the U.S
"When you look at our molecular business, it's still over 80% in the U.S"
", and I think what we're really excited about is we're really starting to get some traction internationally"
"Four out of the last five quarters at growth over 20%, admittedly off small bases, but the numbers – you keep doing that, the numbers start to get much more meaningful"
So I think the market share will probably be more outside the U.S
"Very positive feedback from Europe, and not likely for this year"
We figure that's a 2018-ish approval in the clearance in the U.S
"Yeah, we're going to basically use referrals, but frankly we want our existing GYN Surgical sales force to be selling a little more NovaSure, frankly, right now"
And there continues to be a tremendous opportunity on MyoSure
"We're not sure we've figured out yet how big the full market potential for MyoSure is, so they've got a lot of good things they can still be doing while they make references, but we don't want to distract them and get them trying to sell the full Cynosure bag"
Yeah
"Hey, Rich"
Yeah
"Well, it will not be all at once"
"What we're doing is, we're building a great box that will have opportunities to add products to it over time"
The initial indications will be aesthetic
It'll likely be a U.S
Just the way they've typically filed stuff has been – and we're in the process of changing that – but largely U.S
first and then internationally
I think in the future they could be more global launches
So we'll be excited about the opportunity
Sure
"Yeah, I think – by the way, congratulations on Bartman getting his Cubs ring to you, Brian"
"So, yeah, that's right, exactly"
"I think as it does relate to adding products, we always figured Cynosure will be an opportunity for us to have some inorganic tuck-ins along the way"
"I would tell you in the nearer term, we see such an opportunity between the product pipeline and also our own need to focus on just getting the U.S"
selling organization right up to where we want it to be
"Again, not dissimilar to what we encountered here a few years ago when this management team came into this company"
"So I think that'll be our focus nearer term, and then tuck-in kind of stuff maybe down the road"
But I think it'll certainly be a place for tuck-ins
"It's a great market, and we continue to love being in the medical aesthetics market, think it's going to be one of the highest growth markets to be in"
And out of that will certainly spawn additional opportunities for products or small company things
"No, there's no good reason to expect that our share should be any different"
We've got superior products
"Some of those have one-source contracts and some of those kinds of things, but frankly so did a lot of the big institutions where there was even more money on the line"
"And it comes down to, again, blocking and tackling and great salespeople selling a superior product"
"It just really is – as we've been saying for a long, long time, we predicted there was not going to be a cliff when everybody thought there was going to be a cliff"
"But we said it was going to slow down and be much more flat for a much longer period of time, and that's really how the market's playing out as you go into this segment of the customers"
But we are not relaxing our share expectations one bit
"On the share piece, I think we continue to feel very good that as our sockets, as our gantries come up for renewal, we are doing a very good job on those"
"We don't win all of them, but we win consistently most, and I would say very close to all of them"
"And we continue to win competitive users, so that's why I think we continue to be a net share gainer"
"On Cynosure, I think as we mentioned, we felt very good about the performance in the skin business in the last quarter and feel good about that"
And we think there's still opportunities as we get ramped up to help on the women's health side
"And the body piece, we saw very good improvement in the consumables, but down on the capital sales"
"Yeah, the other way to think about it, David, just from the way we articulated in the script, effectively the guide-down – the midpoint of the guide-down is effectively all Cynosure, from what they just delivered this quarter to what we expect them to deliver this next quarter"
Yeah
"They can totally, I mean, be stable, and they were roughly in line"
Yeah
"Anne, we continue to sell both 2D and 3D outside the U.S"
", and we would expect to continue to do that"
"Over the last several quarters, it's roughly been about 50-50 in terms of the number of placements of 2D and 3D"
The number of units in the U.S
is much higher than it is outside the U.S
"It's roughly 2,000 units outside the U.S"
", 3D units"
Our share outside the U.S
", it's really market dependent, but we still have plenty of opportunity"
It's roughly half of what it is in the U.S
on the digital side
"So I think what it speaks to is the new leadership in place working for the dealers in Europe and then around the world just having an increasing focus on better performance, not only with our dealers but bringing in the right leaders and working in partnership with them on tenders, bringing in some additional capabilities like market access and so forth, that are really helping drive screening protocols across the various countries"
"That's going to take some time, but those are the types of initiatives that we've been investing in over the last 18 months, and it's starting to bear fruit"
"Yeah, obviously with ongoing litigation, we can't comment"
Yeah
"When I said there's going to be continued hiring, by the way, there's going to be continued hiring in every business that we ever have"
It's part of being a growth company
So it's in my DNA that we will be always hiring and expanding our sales organizations
"I think a little bit bigger opportunity here in the Cynosure piece as we replace people that had left, but feeling very good about the leadership we're putting in place"
"Yes, yes"
You got a piece of both
"You know what, I think on MyoSure it is the law of large numbers, as that business has generated – frankly, it had a lot more 30% and high 20% growth quarters than we ever imagined"
"Still a 20% number, very healthy and excited"
"I think on the NovaSure piece, we obviously are going against very tough comps as we had the competitive withdrawal"
"Having said that, you know what? We'd like to be doing better and think we haven't necessarily maintained as much share as we should have"
"I think as we look to 2018, we feel really good"
"We're not giving guidance, obviously, but feel really good about mid-single digit"
I would absolutely say that
"We're going to reaccelerate from, frankly, what is this low third and fourth quarter growth rates"
We just reported 3.1% organic growth
"Fourth quarter is, if you really play out how that will shake out, I think fourth quarter's probably going to be a little bit better than that, is if you really parse out our guidance and this and that"
"But we don't like being down in that level, and as we go into 2018 between the pipelines, getting the Cynosure stuff behind us, getting some of the pipeline stuff out of Breast Health, international kicking in, molecular being good, feel very good that we will be a reaccelerating story in 2018."
