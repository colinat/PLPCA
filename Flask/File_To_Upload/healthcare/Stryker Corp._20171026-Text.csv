"Thanks, Katherine"
My comments today will be focused on our third quarter financial results and the related performance drivers
The detailed financial data and results have been included in today's press release
Organic sales growth for the quarter was 5.5%
"As a reminder, this quarter included one less selling day, reducing growth by roughly 1%"
"As we've previously stated, selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses"
"Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 0.3% impact on sales"
"During the quarter, our sales were negatively impacted by the Sage product action and the hurricanes that interrupted business in Texas and Florida"
These events negatively impacted our overall organic sales growth by 240 basis points
", we continue to see good momentum with organic sales growth of 5.6%, which was evident within Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology segments"
Our U.S
organic sales were negatively impacted by the aforementioned Sage product action and weather-related matters by 320 basis points
"Our international organic sales growth of 5.2% was highlighted by solid performances in Europe, Asia and Latin America"
All geographies were impacted by one less selling day
"Our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52 increased 9.4% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales volumes and some favorability in our effective tax rate"
"Our third quarter EPS, as anticipated, was not significantly impacted by foreign currency exchange rates"
"Taking into account the Sage product actions, the impact of weather and NOVADAQ, we estimate that our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.05 per share"
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance
"Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%, including U.S"
organic growth of 6.1%
"Adjusting for weather-related disruptions in the quarter, our U.S"
Orthopaedic business had organic growth of 6.7%
We experienced a number of canceled hip and knee procedures in Houston and more significantly in Florida as a result of the hurricanes
"We anticipate many of these cases will be rescheduled in the coming months, but cannot predict scheduling availability during Q4. Our U.S"
performance was highlighted by growth in Knees of 4.3% and Trauma and Extremities at 9.9%
These growth rates include the impact of weather-related disruptions
"We continue to see strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio, our Triathlon knee and our Mako robotics platform"
Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 1.2% and included steady performances across all developed markets
"MedSurg continued to have strong results in the quarter with constant currency growth of 6.2% and organic growth of 5.6%, which included a 5.3% increase in the U.S"
"Adjusting for the Sage-related product actions and weather-related disruptions in the quarter, our U.S"
MedSurg group had organic growth of 11.6%
Our Instruments business had U.S
organic sales growth of 6.4%
"This growth is highlighted by continued ramping of our Power Tools business, including our newly launched System 8, as well as good performances of our Sterishield and waste management products"
"Our Endoscopy business had another strong quarter, with U.S"
organic sales growth of 11.8%
"This reflects continued strong demand not only for our 1588 video platform, but also booms and lights and sports medicine implants"
"During the quarter, Endoscopy completed its acquisition of NOVADAQ Technologies, Inc"
"Including this acquisition, U.S"
Endoscopy sales growth during the quarter was 13.8%
Our Medical business had U.S
organic sales decline of 1%
"This reflects the impact of the previously discussed Sage product action, which is in line with our previous Q3 Sage disclosure, as well as a nominal impact related to weather matters"
"Adjusted for these matters, Medical's U.S"
organic sales growth was 15.4%
This growth primarily reflects underlying strong U.S
"growth across Medical's acute care, EMS and Physio businesses, which include continued robustness in our core structure and power cot products"
"Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 7.1%, which reflects strong growth in our Medical businesses, primarily in Europe"
Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 7%
"We continue to see strong global demand for our Neurotech products, which is somewhat offset by softness in our spine business"
"Neurotech business posted growth of 11.8% for the quarter, highlighted by strong demand for our hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke products, CMF products and our neuro-powered instruments"
"spine business continued to see softness across many product areas, which is partially offset by high demand for our 3D-printed Tritanium products"
"Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 10.7%"
This performance was driven by strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia
Now we'll focus on operating highlights for the third quarter
"Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was down 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting an unfavorable mix, price declines and the impact from the disruption to our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Maria"
We continue to invest in innovation with R&D spending of 6.6% of sales
"Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was up 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter"
"This also reflects some negative impacts from our Sage product actions, weather-related matters and the impact related to the consolidation of our NOVADAQ acquisition during the quarter"
"Additionally, we continue to invest in our CTG program, including our ERP implementation, and in our Mako TKA platform"
"In total, adjusted operating expenses were 41.8% of sales, which is up 40 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter"
"In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales and down 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter"
"The impact from Sage, weather-related matters and NOVADAQ on our adjusted operating margin was approximately 75 basis points"
"As it relates to our full-year operating margin expectation, excluding the impact of the one-time items related to Sage, weather and NOVADAQ, we continue to anticipate delivering 30 to 50 basis points improvement"
"Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense"
"Other income and expense decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased interest income"
Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses as well as benefits in geographic income mix
"In the fourth quarter, our tax rate will benefit from certain other geographical and operational changes that, combined with the aforementioned change in accounting, will result in an anticipated full-year effective tax rate in the range of 15.5% to 16%"
"Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $2.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S"
Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.2 billion
"Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $880 million year-to-date"
This includes year-to-date recall-related payments of $492 million
And now I will discuss our third quarter and full-year guidance
"Based on our past performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we anticipate full-year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%"
"As a reminder, the fourth quarter will have the same amount of selling days as 2016. The full year has one less selling day"
"If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the fourth quarter will be impacted positively by 1% and the full year to be nominally impacted"
We expect a negative impact on adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of approximately $0.02 per share and $0.10 in the full year
"With respect to the outlook, recall that in August when we announced the Sage recall, we revised our 2017 EPS outlook to come in at the low end of our $6.45 to $6.55 range, which excluded the anticipated $0.03 to $0.05 of dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ"
"Based on our strong year-to-date results, we now expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share, including $0.05 of dilution related to NOVADAQ, as well as the impacts related to Sage product actions and weather disruptions to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.50 per share"
And now we'll open up the call for Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
"David, as you think about op margin, and we're not giving guidance for 2018, but I can comment that, yes, NOVADAQ was $0.05 dilutive and will be this year"
And we're assuming that it will have no effect in next year
So it'll essentially be flat for next year
"So, that's a little bit of a tailwind"
"As it relates to Sage, Sage will continue to ramp, but it's not going to immediately reach its previous sales levels to where we'll feel a one-for-one impact relative to our operating margin"
"And then, as we mentioned, the weather goes away and we're anticipating that hopefully we'll be able to make most of that up in Q4 anyways"
"Bob, organic growth of 5.5%, Sage and hurricanes of 2.4%, takes you to 7.9%"
"And then if you estimated a 1% impact relative to one less selling day, you get to 8.9%"
"Kristen, there's no real change on the dilution with NOVADAQ"
"I think, really, just the robustness and strength of the top line that we're expecting, and not only just in Q3, but just what we typically and historically have seen in Q4. And so, that really will allow us to kind of cover some of these things that previously we thought would have a bigger impact"
Yeah
"I think we're actually a little up year-to-date, but you're right, it's maybe close to flat"
"If you go back and look at Q4, it typically is our strongest sales quarter and also generates the greatest amount of leverage in every single year"
We'll expect that that will also happen this year with our sales growth expectations
"Also, we're beginning to see some of the benefits from our CTG investments, which I think will contribute to that in Q4. And then if I think about excluding those impacts of Sage, weather, NOVADAQ, which are not incidental to the margin, I think we'll be in the range of 30 to 50 basis points for the full year"
"Yeah, I think going back to when we introduced sort of the cost transformation for growth program we talked about margin expansion over a five-year period of time"
"That included sort of a range of 30 to 50 basis points of expansion each year and 30 basis points in the earlier year, ramping more to like 50 basis points in the latter year"
"And really, beyond that, I think you can look at sort of what we've historically done in Q4 in operating margins, which is fairly more significant than the first three quarters of a year"
And that should give you pretty good guidance
And we'll revisit it at Q4 when we give guidance for 2018.
