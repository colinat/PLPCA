Adjusted operating income was $226 million up 59.4% in constant currency,,,
"Well, as you can see from the quarter, we're continuing to invest in marketing and brand building",,,
"So once again, we will come back in the coming quarters with some specific answers",,,
"Now, let's turn to slide 15 and U.S",,,
"Meaning the organic is  the good news, there are so many very strong drivers of growth within the current organic travel retail",,,
"So, it actually  if you go into the store from checking the retail price you wouldn't see it because of its offers that are made directly to customers, sums via coupons",,,
"Sales in tracked channels remain healthy and we continue to see very strong growth in non-tracked channels, particularly in e-commerce and clubs",,,
"Excluding the difference, organic net sales would have been up low single-digits in the quarter led by growth in Hagen-Dazs and Nature Valley",,,
It's not a deep value,,,
"So net-net, we feel good about the state of our business",,,
"We are devoting additional resources to the top doors and promoting in-store events on retailers' websites where, as I just mentioned, our business had been brisk",,,
We still think that makes lots of sense,,,
"Number one, giving you an accurate e-commerce or online versus off-line share is pretty tough for us to do because there's a lot of our traditional brick and mortar customers that do quite a bit of click-and-collect",,,
"I think some of that 50% or so, half of it being consumption decline, was related to the January, February impacts that I think the entire industry felt",,,
"So, we've tended to focus more on innovation and pull-related spending, more A&M spending",,,
You're welcome,,,
And that's been our strategy over the last decade because we anticipated some of these trends early on and we started to re-tool the company for that,,,
"As the FDA itself acknowledged, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement, and again we'll say more about all this next week",,,
And the only reason why the overall portfolio looks negative is because it's center store business in grocery stores,,,
"So, just a couple of things",,,
"Given the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending",,,
Our customers will appreciate that we offer ClickList; our associates obviously in terms of being able to provide the service will be glad; and our shareholders will be glad,,,
"Within Prepared Foods, we have two well-developed businesses in both retail and food service channels",,,
Sure,,,
"So I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price",,,
"The improvement in the base business is encouraging, but it is still very early days",,,
"In the Middle East, which is another big market for us, clearly this year we saw the impact of the lower oil price, the tax on CSDs, all of that went into place",,,
"So for example, the improvements in Asia particularly in China are even better than expected",,,
"We  that said, we have had really good margin expansion in the category and were operating as a company very profitably",,,
"Fiscal 2017 was marked not only by our strong performance in which we continued our relentless focus on the customer, but also because of the some important highlights that include the addition of the Brakes business in Europe, a completion of the successful transition of 12 operating companies from SAP through enhanced version of our legacy ERP system, and validation of our customer-centric approach to our business as reinforced by the improvement in our customer loyalty scores",,,
"In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release",,,
"Hey, Josh, I can't go into detail on price or anything that you call the give-backs",,,
"Millennials, we need to drive relevancy",,,
"Youre going to see every brand to have three, five, big serious initiative well-focused by category",,,
"However, this multiyear program should enable us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019 and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation",,,
"In Home Care, which is our largest U.S",,,
"We really think that our performance  that was a weak performance in 2016 and Europe has absolutely no correlation with the cost side and like you mentioned the overhead, I think, there was a lot of correlation on the stakes, on the go-to-market and things on the promo side, volume mix that didn't work out as we showed, and what we are actually encouraged about is when you see the Q4, the performance by all the business, especially the Benelux and the UK had improved significant looking at sell out consumption, looking at share on the main category, soup, beans, sauces, and you already have 70% of renovation for the year ready in the market",,,
"And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well",,,
It has gross margins as robust as any in the industry and growth rates that lead the industry,,,
We've got the fem care U by Kotex Fitness launch coming,,,
We see market share growth in HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy and several other brands,,,
Yes,,,
"I walk-in to the habit of revisiting that chart that were both over zero; so we did have cost inflation, as well as retail price inflation that got past on but we didn't pass all of it",,,
We have the largest corporate share in skin care and fragrances and we have tied for first in makeup,,,
So that -- and we believe well continue to see that momentum into the second quarter,,,
"Now to wrap up, confections is one of the largest segments within the $100 billion U.S",,,
"No, I wish I could tell you the clear answer, because then I would have done something about it before now",,,
This is graphically depicted on slide number 16 (sic) [17],,,
This quarter was even better,,,
"I missed kind of the second part of that, I think it had to do with the inflation-deflation",,,
Our luxury fragrance brands also performed beautiful,,,
"In this environment and for the last several years, we have been acting very decisively and aggressively",,,
"Jason, I appreciate the positive comments on our pricing as we said we got a little ahead of ourselves in some cases and hurt on the volume side",,,
"And then the last thing, Akshay, and I want to make this part just clear on your opening comment",,,
"And year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well",,,
"When we last spoke in September, we outlined our expectations for fiscal 2018 and indicated that we anticipated a challenging first half",,,
"As far as trade deals with the retailers, usually that's going to be six months out",,,
"That feels like the right place for us to continue to drive growth, Dennis",,,
"We're continuing to invest in digital marketing, as you point out, some new packaging and definitely new product innovation",,,
I hope you can sense our optimism and positive energy around it,,,
"This has resulted in our decision to close approximately 600 stores and related assets over an 18-month period, beginning in spring 2018. We estimate the cost of this program to be approximately $450 million, substantially all cash spend",,,
"As we said in the last call, this is going to be a period of brilliant disruption over the next three to five years and we're going to approach it with pessimism or optimism",,,
So I'm glad we're going to see you next week and we are going to talk about Marlboro in some detail there,,,
"We see food as a massive, $1.5 trillion market, and we have a substantial growth opportunity in that market",,,
"Basically, I think, as we look forward, we're still looking at retailers, if they want to deliver margin growth in a period in which they're seeing price compression, they have a couple choices",,,
"As I noted earlier, there were a few near-term factors impacting our gross margin performance",,,
"However, to achieve them, we must further invest to diversify our portfolio towards the faster-growing consumer spaces of health and well-being and snacking, while increasing our participation in the growing e-commerce space",,,
"Thank you, Joe",,,
should be bolstered by the recent opening of an online store on China Tmall website aimed on engaging young Chinese consumers,,,
"Yeah, go ahead, Mike",,,
"We're focused on reducing the cost structure as you call out, but we continue to see that we're doing the right things in that business, and outside of a massive grain shock, we feel like we're in a great, great position",,,
"It's in select markets, but it's not an inexpensive proposition",,,
We estimate this would have been broadly flat taking into account the leap year impact,,,
"The brand is in excellent shape, very desirable",,,
"And so when we talk about that business, we are talking across all those different categories that are performing well",,,
"And again, through key season, were seeing the category grow and it appears to be healthy and were having good constructive conversations with the retailers around it",,,
But really double-digit growth on seasonal is what's a big component of 2.5%,,,
"So, I won't reiterate all of those",,,
And we are seeing impacts from that,,,
We think we have the plans to do that,,,
And I think we'd probably say we're still trying to exactly figure it out what happened with the consumer in North America in the first quarter,,,
"Every metric we have out there for our storage to do better on, we already have a group of stores achieving those results, and as we get better at achieving those over a broader base of stores, thats one of the things that we think is going to give us incremental fuel for the engine to continue to invest in the four piece",,,
We think commodities are probably going to rise after having certainly been a tailwind over the last year or so,,,
Our top-line performance is underpinned by strong market positions in growing categories and an enviable portfolio of leading brands,,,
"Yeah, David",,,
"We have also taken some measures to consolidate some commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency as I said in the script, and also deploying a number of global standard of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our sales force",,,
"In the end, we are encouraged by seeing our investments paying off, from condiments and sauces across Latin America, and on a more local basis, a strong organic growth in China, India, Korea, and the Middle East and Africa",,,
"Looking ahead in the China market, we expect another year of significant volume growth",,,
"In addition, over the past several years, we have amplified our own financial investments in R&D by expanding and strengthening our relationships with key strategic suppliers and academic and research institutions to leverage their capabilities to our benefit",,,
"Like we said before, we're hitting our levels right at our competition",,,
"We'll reduce the amount that we buy back, and we'll redeploy that amount towards acquisitions",,,
"While there were some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continue to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements",,,
It was about a big strategic move to get ahead of the shopper is why we did it,,,
But that's about the only one that I can think of that there's maybe a direct commodity driven price change that we'd see coming this year,,,
Our Goldfish crackers continued to outperform the category in a meaningful way,,,
"And this will continue internationally, which is a very important objective because as you all know, the Specialty Multi-Channel globally is one of the fastest growing channels in our sector",,,
"So, we're going to continue to focus on those where we have challenges",,,
"As you can see, this is the case",,,
We are accelerating the execution of the strategy as some U.S,,,
Weve tend to try to innovate on the premium end,,,
"Not to get too technical, but the grade change between the diaper and a pant would be time consuming enough, that you probably wouldn't want to do it very often, so it's better to have dedicated assets",,,
"We won't have the ongoing integration charges, but the bigger driver in all of this is really the sales momentum for Grocery Products",,,
"At the same time, we have directed a higher percentage of our A&M budget from non-working A&M to consumer-facing working A&M to increase returns in our A&M spending",,,
"We've got some good strong sales growth even in the first quarter in retail, foodservice, deli",,,
So we knew the first half was going to be a tougher comparison to deliver organic growth,,,
And we will generate $700 million of savings for our previously announced projects of roughly $160 million above fiscal 17 levels,,,
"And most of the other brands are growing double-digit, triple-digit, out of our [indiscernible] where were including the small brands where we have an impairment on",,,
"Clearly, we're going to spending and have spent a lot more on the Tyson brands and we're going to continue to spend on the other brands that we have the number one position",,,
And we are delighted to delight consumers with our indulgent portfolio,,,
"I mean, despite Quaker being one of the LTS of all (34:54) PepsiCo brands, it seems the top line has been soft for quite some time, now including this quarter",,,
"Finally, we have both the ability and the desire to build strong brands and drive growth in response to increasing consumer demand for fresh foods",,,
"And to your second question, certainly there are elements of both, right? I think we are still probably gaining back some distribution, but you're gaining back distribution because there's consumer demand",,,
"But the reality is, were growing share across all channels",,,
"With that, I'll hand it over to Dave to share more on the details of the quarter",,,
Clinique and M,,,
"And so, its incremental headwind",,,
We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually,,,
"I don't know, Mike, is there anything else you want to add to that or?",,,
So it's tough to model I know quarter-by-quarter but I did point out in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets we had some growth really in the period when you get price changes in the market where people tend to buy ahead of customers buy ahead of the price change and that was the notable impact in the second quarter,,,
We are committed to that,,,
"This non-GAAP result was up nearly 50% on a reported basis, which demonstrates the substantial earnings accretion from the MillerCoors transaction",,,
"The overall, at Coty, Inc",,,
"Our European operations are improving, year-over-year improvements there",,,
"Well, as those stores are open long enough they will flip back into our ID store base",,,
Adjusted gross profit was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to the decline in sales,,,
I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to,,,
"Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S",,,
"And then finally, we did hold our in-season soup prices longer than prior year",,,
"As I discussed earlier, in Consumer Beauty, we saw strong digital engagement in connection with COVERGIRL PDA campaign, which in turn benefited the brand in market performance",,,
We do very robust analytics on our price gaps and thresholds of the brands versus private label,,,
In the U.S,,,
"In the Beef segment, our operating income was a record $299 million, with a record operating margin of 8.5%",,,
This is due to the delay in reaching go-to-market agreements with key retailers in Q1. Volume/mix mainly reflected ongoing consumption growth in condiments and sauces that was offset by lower shipments of mac and cheese versus the prior year,,,
"And I think over time, you'll continue to see it go down, its typically what happens in that any segment of retailing to get laser focused on one particular year or one particular quarter",,,
And then that certainly was a driver of that,,,
"They had another great quarter in the first quarter, and there's no signs of that business slowing down",,,
This incremental expense of $58 million in Q1 impacted Chicken by $23 million and Prepared Foods by $22 million,,,
"So, we are in the process of understanding the level of stock there is in the market",,,

as well,,,

"As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A on a constant currency basis was 0.9 percentage points lower at 32.8%, reflecting work we have done to reduce costs, particularly in the UK",,,
And a lot of what you see is the sheer size of our broadline business especially in the U.S,,,
"I mean, at the moment, we're really I go back to  we're looking at customer behavior and how that's changing inside of the Walgreens brand and inside the Walgreens box, the properties",,,
Dennis will discuss the online segment shortly,,,

The investment paid off,,,
"com, ClickList, Express Lane and home delivery",,,
"We are seeing probably, I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment on this, just a little bit less in terms of the fill-in trips may be part of it as some retailers unpacked that",,,
"Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.31, up 22.4%",,,
"This is really about a balanced approach, making sure we are focused the right levers of the business that starts with that local customer where we can incremental value and doing the things that help basically get recognized and rewarded by them for providing the right products and the right services in a right way",,,
And I think that what you're seeing right now is pricing that was sensible for the first quarter,,,
And even in markets like the U.K,,,
They set some records last night and we're setting some records ourselves here today,,,
"Volume was up 4.3%, while average price was down 1%",,,

"And I think, Hugh, it's fair to say that with the changing marketplace, where there's blurring of retail channels, the consumer preferences changing, the marketing models changing, we have to invest in these new capabilities in order to generate the top line growth we are generating",,,
marketplace presence and solid financial position gives us the flexibility to smartly invest in confectionery and other snacks as well as in the capabilities that give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers,,,

"We actually entered the third quarter be more optimistic, regarding farmer commercialization",,,
"Indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up a tenth over the half",,,
We expect it will come back to where it is on the curve and we see some improvement there,,,
Often the e-com players really aren't even holding any inventory,,,
You should not interpret that as a string of pearl strategy in lieu of more transformational deals,,,
"So, if you could just give us a sense from a sales standpoint whether you see that Waterpik is coming in ahead of plan? And then, staying with Waterpik, what percent of the sales come from sort of electronic  the gadget part and what percent from the replacement part that's more the annuity business, and just what's the cycle there?

And we're working through how we achieve it in the near-term,,,
"Yeah, Id probably say comparable, but we've got some pretty good items in there and I think were not ready to kind of disclose what they are yet, Paul, But I think we feel good about it",,,

"In 2016 we estimated that the spend in the category was about $2.5 billion; that was flat to 2015. But we have seen a pick-up both in volume and in dollar sales in 2017. So I don't know, maybe 8% on volume year-over-year",,,
"The deflationary environment was less severe in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, coming in at 20 basis points deflationary without fuel",,,
"Our tax rate was significantly higher this fourth quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings as well as approximately $18 million of discrete tax expenses in 2016 compared to approximately $100 million of discrete tax benefit in 2015, which were a result of portfolio management actions taken in the year-ago quarter",,,

So China historically was really driven by skincare,,,
"And the Specialty Products of 5% is driven by the fact that, over the last couple years, we bought a couple of businesses, one was VI-COR, the other Agro BioSciences that got us into things other than dairy, so we're expecting a lot of growth from that business going forward",,,

"If you look at Simple Truth, last year it was about a 1.7 billion category for us",,,

And I did refer to this brand in the past as a neglected brand,,,
"Unfortunately, this year weve been unable to reach an agreement with a large customer on a promotional program for soup",,,
"This reflected our seasonal reduction in inventories, as well as an improved receivables position",,,

"So I think we'll get it back over the course of the year, but it doesn't bounce back immediately",,,
"SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a 460-basis point increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement",,,
"In terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up",,,
"For example, we've introduced the category management and revenue management processes, and we are offering multi-channel ordering via online and telephony, as we provide our customers the ability to choose how they order from Sysco",,,
Strategically our top priority this year is strengthening top line performance behind modernized brands and a strong innovation slate,,,

"But generally speaking, we feel fine about how it's affecting the business right now",,,
"Yeah, I wouldn't say any of it, it will be much more market specific, so in places like Brazil and Argentina where there's a lot of local market inflation, not necessarily even big commodity categories",,,
"We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow, this is because we're bringing an off-balance sheet item on your balance sheet, we're funding an obligation already on our balance sheet",,,

"It's been happening in many markets and I think it reflects some of the limitations of syndicated data and they need to go back and retool it, but we are very comfortable where we are and we are just going to keep running the business this way",,,
"That's a hard one, Jeremy",,,
"So, I know one store that has a pretty high percentage, its right off the interstate, so that store has gained a lot of new customers because its easy on and easy off, the interstate and their trade area for ClickList is completely different than their trade area for the store",,,
"Our innovation is helped by our brands' and retailers' websites, which play a key role as a marketing vehicle to raise awareness of our new products",,,
And the three divisions are in a different state of evolution because Professional Beauty is actually growing and the hair portfolio is growing even faster,,,
And Yoplait Mix-Ins targets towards traditional yogurt levers looking for great tasting snack options is the second largest launch in the category this year,,,
"So, I'm going to let Hugh get all the answers ready for the 10 questions you asked in operating margin, Ali",,,

"Obviously, our business fundamentals remain strong",,,
But we'll see when we get the next share data,,,
"So I wouldn't say it's dependent on improvement in category growth, it's more sustaining what we see happening and then executing against it",,,
"In the un-tipped segment, there's basically a price we're going on where people are competing for volume, but at a very low profitability, and we're really not participating in that segment",,,
I don't think that the inflation or deflationary environment necessarily affects or changes that competitive nature and who we're competing with,,,
"In our Cleaning segment, we saw third quarter volume increase 13% and sales grew 7%, and this was behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products",,,
"That's not really as applicable at this time, right",,,

I would ask you to think about it as it's going to be offset by continued improvement in our continuous improvement efforts and discipline,,,
We need stronger IDs and we've had the last few quarters and we need to get back of the productivity loop of allowing our operating costs to come down as a rate of sales to grow that operating profit margin,,,

"Whether that's TV, media type investments, whether it's customer focused investments, whether it's capital into pack/price format investments to make sure that we have exactly the right offering in the right channel to fit the consumers and the shoppers' needs",,,
So I would say that that is an overall theme in the industry between retailers and manufacturers that we are all jointly working on together,,,
So that's one of the ways we look at getting proper return on our M&A investments and we'll continue to strike the right balance between being aggressive and being disciplined going forward,,,
It's also fair to say that I'm not sure that the Q4 was a good benchmark and Q4 results reflected a certain non-recurring cost that were not included as onetime,,,

"Accordingly, we're making investments in innovation and renovation to enhance distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial to drive top line growth",,,
"Overall, our Premium Light segment volumes were down low-single digits",,,
"Organic sales growth was driven by our international consumer business, and our SPD division",,,
"So, we do think we can learn a lot from these guys",,,
We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is healthy,,,
"So, starting with our Brita water-filtration business, despite the sales and volume decline due to tough comps, again, particularly on our faucet mount products, our Q3 shipments this year on our pour-through systems and filters increased behind our latest wave of innovation, and specifically that was on a couple of products launched in mid-February",,,

"So, frankly, no",,,
"And so from our perspective, we still believe that it is important for us to kind of drive this 200 basis point spread over our long-term cost of capital",,,
"It's early on in those handfuls of markets, but early signs are the customers doing seems to be encouraging and hopefully as we get to the end of the year and it starts to be  end of the year and then the next year something that becomes a little bit of a tailwind instead of the headwind",,,
The growth is coming and we expect the growth even to ramp up going forward,,,

Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements,,,
Sure,,,

"We have opened 100 sites just this quarter in a very efficient way, scalable and agile, meaning where we see it works, we can invest more",,,
"And the other thing that I would add David is that there is momentum we have take into consideration and as you saw F 17 unfold, we saw some negative momentum in Q2 and Q3, we began turning that in Q4, but it doesnt turn overnight and so we will continue to see that momentum improve as year unfolds thats why I indicated earlier Q1 we dont expect to see a lot better performance than in Q4, but we expect Q2 to be better and the second half to be better still",,,
"The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market, on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division, and the distraction associated with the integration efforts",,,
"So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2018. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. As usual, this guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year",,,
"And in that environment we try to strike the right balance between our desire to be aggressive with M&A to help reshape our portfolio for better growth and better margins, but also to be disciplined",,,

So there is more of this in the second semester,,,
We expect to use free cash flow and potential proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in the range,,,
In line with the takes to make on that sales end,,,
Weve always believed that our customers shouldnt have to pay higher prices just because a product is natural or organic,,,
"Our profit was down this quarter, but improved sequentially over the first quarter and we have clear initiatives that will deliver profit growth in the second-half",,,
"So that's difficult to say, but we did make the decision to react to those prices and to keep the customers inside of our stores",,,

Looking at our categories now,,,
"When we acquired it in June 2015, Garden Fresh Gourmet was a small operation with approximately $100 million in revenue and very little infrastructure",,,
"As planned, constant currency net sales increased 1.1% in the third quarter",,,
"Hsu Yeah, I think were still digging through the data on that, but I do think, a part of it is, I would say yes right now it's about average",,,
"Since today, they have wider choices of where to shop for prestige beauty products",,,
"Organic sales declined 1%, while adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, both increased double-digits",,,
In addition we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity,,,
"And so, in the first half of this year, it's around 2%",,,
I would say that the competition in the smokeless side of the business is competitive,,,
We participate in the tipped and we have basically a large market share there,,,
"For the quarter, our amount sold on deal for laundry detergent was 36%",,,
"We have some promotional launches and some promotional activity from other competitors but we monitor that carefully, as you know",,,
"Retailers love wheat, because it is driving more sales with current consumers and attracting new yogurt buyers",,,
This is David,,,
Slightly south of 2% is what we saw in the first half,,,
"So between those two things, that's really what's going to offset some of the difficult market conditions for JOTS",,,
"Yes, generally, there's a trend towards a strengthening dollar",,,
"And then you could see on the other end, a combination of small brands and private label that flanks it on the other side",,,
"And thanks to this, we are increasing the trial level of our new innovations",,,
So I'd rather depend on your opinions here and we'll keep our opinions to ourselves on this one,,,
We continue to see solid trends underlying the results in three of our four regions,,,
"And we would be much more focused on how do we make sure the innovation, the quality and the offerings that we have, we earn the right for the customers to take it to that kind of level",,,
"Then for the Huggies, they want them to stay in Huggies and I think our job again here is to want to serve the consumer and how they want us to be served and give them the choices and provide the best products, so they can make the choice",,,
"Note that in Q1, the pace of net savings versus the prior year was consistent with our expectations and we do expect that pace to pick up more in the second half of the year",,,
"So related to the Unilever potential transaction, we really believe that as I said in the M&A framework it's kind of  again, if you go back here in terms of only consumer brands, brands with a strong market share, brands that can travel, similar go-to-market, similar operation, I think at the end of the day that these two segments of the consumer product goods are very similar and that's the reason why you see also many companies operating brands for consumers, sometimes food, sometimes personal care, sometimes healthcare",,,
", for example, and is expanding in other markets",,,
Got it,,,
"And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise",,,

"Retail sales declined 1% in the first two months of key season, but were seeing month-by-month improvement and we posted growth in November",,,
So we are definitely making longer term plans to address that,,,

Fiscal 2017 was a successful year for Sysco and I'm proud of the results our associates have accomplished this year,,,

George?,,,

Let me give my comments and then Hugh step in with yours,,,
And so I don't think there is a distinction really in the amount of investment between U.S,,,
"Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is enabling us to cut expenses, become more efficient, and create great leverage of our sales growth",,,
"And one of the things that seemed to be pretty broad based across a number of retailers, and as I was hearing comments across manufacturers is that people were optimistic in terms of their plans, and I felt as though people were looking to really invest in their business from a merchandising standpoint and promotion",,,
"Then I want to add that on MAC we are also working on new freestanding store formats that will address the ability to have freestanding store also in lower productivity situation while low tourist traffic because they will be smaller, more connected online, more engaging for consumers and more profitable",,,
"The transition wasn't seamless, like I said, but we feel like that we're on path to make that a long-term healthy strong business for us, both in terms of Prepared Foods growth and also the margin structure",,,
The primary drivers of the decrease are higher marketing in support of our new product launches and higher consumer promotional spending,,,

"In this business, what we mean with profitable is to keep that spread there",,,
"Adjusted operating margin was 8.9%, up 0.8 percentage points in constant currency",,,
But what you're saying is what we're doing,,,
"Hey, Wendy",,,
"We're seeing stocks-to-use ratios maybe stabilizing, maybe coming down",,,
Some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin,,,
"And, I believe that some of our brands have not played the right role in the social engagement, and by shifting the investment actually we will achieve not only the consumers that we want to achieve, but also in the right place and the right time, and the overall connection with the brand will improve",,,
"And if you think about a customer transaction, if we could take the customer's order, get the price exactly right, the quantity shipped on the date they wanted it with the correct terms",,,
"So investments that we're going to make in the business, we know that there needs to be a paid for (51:24)",,,

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,,,
"We have a $0.02 drag in Q3, largely because of the transactional and transitional expenses and not a full quarter worth of earnings",,,
This is important because it's also the time when we are pivoting our teams' focus to driving top-line growth,,,
"And on changing the range, as Mike mentioned, if we left the range the same as it was before, it could have meant, we would have had positive -- negative identical, excuse me, for the second half of the year",,,

So that's going to be a positive story for us and that's what gives us more confidence,,,
"We developed our Simple Truth brand to be honest, easy and affordable because our data told us this was a great customer need in the marketplace",,,

"Thanks, Karen",,,
You're welcome,,,
"They're going to be much lower in the fourth quarter, and that's  it can be somewhat lumpy in international, and one of the reasons for that is because of export",,,
And then I think Tracey will address Leading Beauty Forward,,,
"Promotion is only one element of how this is evolving and, frankly, not the biggest one in my opinion",,,
"For example, we promoted more than 1,700 team members worldwide last year",,,

So we were up a couple of percent or percent and a half or simple like last year,,,
"We have deep experience successfully managing our business across a wide variety of distribution channels, for example in the UK and in many European countries",,,
"Thank you, Andrew",,,

"But yes, basically, prestige market we believe will continue to grow 4% to 5%",,,
"So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter",,,
Our workplace and culture are more than the product of corporate policies,,,
"And as you think of that business in specific parts of the store, the walled deli space is extremely competitive",,,

"As I said before, we only give guidance on one number",,,
Fourth quarter organic net sales for our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment were comparable to last year,,,
We also focused on improving efficiencies to build a strong foundation on the bottom line and expand margins,,,
But I would say that the recurring cost structure increase is less than the accounting true-up for the first quarter and it does make a lot of sense for us to focus on making sure that we have a one-Tyson system as it relates to compensation,,,

"And so while we are outperforming the center store categories handsomely, I think our next challenge is how do we leverage our relationships with retailers to reinvent center store",,,
"So next year, we will be running a full play",,,
"So our expectation is that the brands, in total, will stabilize over time thanks to the distribution balance, the drive of online, the improved innovation program, and having then in the base the periods that the brand had in the last year",,,
We feel good about it,,,
"Additionally, OPI has continued to grow in North America, with international markets being our next area of focus",,,
"And so, I mentioned Mexico, Australia, Brazil, but we have also some other, Bourjois continues to grow market share both in Europe, but also in Russia, Middle East",,,
"So our strategy in terms of repositioning the brands, and you mentioned COVERGIRL, it's not just the only one, is key to reconnect with the consumers",,,
So we feel very good about our progress so far,,,
"Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume increased 10% and sales grew 3% behind higher shipments of Home Care products and Professional Products, partially offset by lower shipments of Laundry products",,,
tracked channels increased 1/10th of a point versus the year-ago quarter with gains in four of our eight U.S,,,
Tracey?,,,
We've never really tried to look at it as a power struggle and we really appreciate the partnerships we've had with our CBG suppliers,,,
"Again, it's temporary, we're taking the actions and we are all over it",,,
"And we had strong commercial plans across our businesses for Q2 and the second half, though I'm confident that our sales performance will improve",,,
"For the quarter, Luxury revenues increased organically by 5% while for the year, organic revenues declined a moderate 1%",,,
", and just been published a research on this",,,
"By the end of July, we were shipping completely via warehouse distribution to all customers and exiting our DCs, trucks and equipment and reducing the workforce",,,
"Look, the category has picked back up, as you say",,,
"And so we've actually set our budgets and our cost plans based upon ensuring that our, what I call core central staffs, do not exceed the 2012 levels",,,
Foodservice Operations segment,,,
But there's nothing that we'd be fallen off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter,,,
So we think thats a very rich space for us to expand with our brands internally,,,
It'll necessarily need to have like some of the biodiesel in order to trying to meet that particular  those RVOs there,,,
"CytoSport posted growth this quarter, driven by our success in the food, drug, mass, and convenience channels in addition to growth in CytoSport powders",,,
"La Mer was a standout, driven by the successful launch of its Renewal Oil and Skin Color Collection, a key entry in the fast-growing area that bridges skin care and makeup",,,
And I think this is explainable in many ways but one way maybe I want to add as far Este Lauder Company are concerned,,,
"Net interest expense was up approximately $18 million to $81 million primarily due to higher short-term interest rates, our overall mix of short-term and long-term debt following the issuance of our new fixed-rate debt in August of last year, a favorable interest rate expense adjustment last year, and some additional interest expense related to foreign income taxes due from prior years",,,
So we've done this very successfully with Plum and Kelsen,,,

pricing was up 5% or more,,,
"So, that's a good thing for gross margin",,,
"And so we'll continue to work on that, and we've been very successful",,,
This improvement was primarily due to sales mix and higher sales as well as an amendment to certain employee postretirement benefits and our cost transformation program,,,
Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter,,,
So we're always looking for ways to reduce cost to fill,,,
"As we look to the fourth quarter, our sales growth should increase farther, enabling us to deliver our financial and sales target for the full year and position us for a strong start in fiscal year 2018. Our success this quarter came despite continued external macro headwinds in certain areas",,,
"Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness",,,
I'll take up on that,,,
"And finally, we continue to realize good margin expansion",,,
"During the quarter, we filled 255.2 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 8.5%",,,

"We're actually quite pleased with how we manage the expenses from the core business, if you will, to Brakes to the corporate office",,,
"And then on the commodities inflation, it's not enough to drive finished product selling prices in most places, and particularly, when you see many of the international markets, the currency turning favorable, it's not a calculus that would lead to a lot of price in markets like that",,,
"Additionally, the retailer environment continues to be very aggressive, with e-commerce and value players applying increased pressure on grocery and mass channels and we do not anticipate this trend to abate anytime soon",,,
"As expected, organic net sales performance continued to improve in Q3 to a 0.4% decline",,,
"We entered Hong Kong, a new market for our online business, with a brand size from GLAMGLOW",,,

"And we have developed a strategy where we really can follow the consumer across traveling corridors, and we can make sure also our innovation speaks to them in a coherent way between current country or regions (50:56) where they travel",,,

"Clinique marketing will focus on the instant benefits of Moisture Surge, which has been growing in most markets",,,
Yes,,,
"Year-to-date retail sales are Lucky Charms and Cocoa Puffs reached up 14%, while Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Reeses Puffs are up 8%, the corn puff and kid cereals, because roughly half of the consumption on these brands is by adults",,,
I'm encouraged by the sales gains in soup and simple meals,,,
"In terms of, Ken, I mean, naturally you mentioned there are things that we can control and there's things that we can't control",,,
"And so will we lean harder on productivity, we will always lean harder on productivity, because we believe that we ought to take out any cost that is not value creating and put it back into investments in the business or flow it through to the bottom-line",,,
We did not give any specific guidance on the level of buyback well do and obviously it depended on market conditions as well as our Board being willing to give us incremental authorization,,,
"Once again, we were able to grow share in the quarter",,,
"We've seen the results of the innovation coming through volume, and we are prepared at CAGNY to show you some pretty fantastic progress we've made on our innovation pipeline",,,

And then we'll open up the call for your questions,,,
"In terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience",,,
but around the world,,,

plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goal,,,
I'd say too often some of those things don't work out and you need human beings to fix and adjust and correct all those minor errors that happen,,,
"I mean, its been up slightly",,,
"Our core tax rate, which excludes discrete tax impacts, was in line with our rate in the third quarter",,,
"Against this backdrop, we believe we have an exciting pipeline of innovation in the near future that will revitalize the retail hair category and transform it into a beauty category instead of a functional category",,,
"And so, our focus is truly to build a closer partnership with the retail customers and ensure that we create an amazing consumer experience, in store and online",,,
We attribute the strong results to locally relevant products and communications and targeted expanded consumer reach,,,
"As we stated on last quarter's conference call, first quarter net sales would be greater than retail takeaway due to Easter timing",,,
"Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most disruptive immediately following implementation, after which the rate of decline moderates",,,
Innovation continues to be an important part of our growth plans,,,
"We're planning for continued category declines while working on initiatives to stabilize share and shift focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy and mint platforms",,,
to provide it exceptional artistry services,,,
That's even despite the sizable reinvestments we're making,,,
"And another key element of differentiation in the structure that we had chosen is that we have end-to-end responsibility with the division, as I said, but also that the P&L sits with the countries",,,
We will only further intensify our process improvement efforts,,,
And dollars per trip were actually up in March after having been down,,,
An example of this is on the slide,,,

"During the quarter, we launched Jo Malone and La Mer into a few key Sephora doors, including its largest one that recently opened in Manhattan, and also on sephora",,,
"Again, this is net of some of the inflation and investments we talked about, so that's an all-in number",,,
"Our KCP business in particular saw, a little weaker year than we were expecting there",,,
"So, regarding the restage of COVERGIRL, as you can imagine, it's a competitive restage",,,
"So probably I could (52:06) start and say our absolute advertising spending is going to be more or less stable across the year and will be  is assumed to be a bit stronger actually in the second six months, so in the six months we have in front of us, particularly in the third quarter because of innovation launches and activities",,,
"Its just at anytime you go from higher prices to lower prices, the thing that gets disruptive is how quickly will people lower prices and then the flip is the case as inflation creeps back in, how quickly will people adjust prices the other direction, to continue to protect the gross margin dollars that they would have in those products",,,
"So what you see today is actually an acceleration in Asia, absolutely",,,
"In Professional Beauty, we also have a growing e-commerce business is smaller because, as you could imagine, Professional Beauty is mostly focused on salon professionals, so hairdressers, manicurists and so on",,,
"Actually, our -- the share that private label has of condensed soup and RTS soup is significantly below the average in center store categories and only up slightly",,,
"You'll see it play out, but I think it'll play out as you get through the third quarter into the fourth quarter, I think it'll be much clearer in some of that reported data",,,
"And the reaction and the spirit is actually very good, because they are seeing the plans that we're putting in place",,,
Our share would be high teens,,,

"As I previously stated, V8 will not grow this year",,,
"Comparable retail sales were down 2.1% in the quarter, with declines in consumables and general merchandise and the personal care categories partially offset by growth in the beauty and health and wellness categories",,,
It is coherent from a consumer standpoint,,,
"This improvement is being driven by the strength of our year-to-date results, coupled with an improved outlook on foreign exchange impact",,,
"It means yes, yes, speed to market and so on",,,
"And, of course, we expect further (49:20) improvements afterwards",,,
"Half of that, we think, is consumption-related broad-based trends in the marketplace",,,
That $200 million in gross,,,
We're still awaiting consumer takeaway,,,
"I think, as we said, we're still at the beginning of our journey, and we're putting in place a series of ideas and actions to improve this",,,
"Brand-building was up in Q3 and will be up much more in Q4. Our investment in promotions and in-store support with our customers is now beginning to come to life as we reinvest behind these biggest brands, and that will continue as we go into next year",,,
And that's what has made us more valuable partners to convenience store retailers,,,
We remain enthusiastic about the launch of our new Well Yes! clean label soup,,,

"Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 9% volume growth and 4% sales growth",,,
"The strength of our customer relationships was evident in the most recent Kantar Retail PoweRanking in the United States, where we achieved the top spot as the number one best-in-class manufacturer, and we earned top marks in the individual categories of most important brands, use of digital platforms, insights and category management, growth and profitability, supply chain management, clear company strategy, and sales force and customer teams",,,
"Look, we always look with this, the way that we think the categories and the brand, we always look and think about profitable and organic growth",,,
Good morning,,,
"As we promote our wide array of beauty products, we are focusing our marketing spending on digital to allow how consumers are seeking communications and information",,,

"And then all of the other businesses that go within Quaker North America, including Rice-A-Roni, Pasta Roni, Aunt Jemima, there's a whole bunch of other businesses, ready-to-eat cereals",,,
We're not looking to lose space,,,
"So, both of us are very focused on growing the business",,,
"Data analytics are fully integrated in our business, as 84.51 helps us make merchandising, operations and marketing decisions",,,
"Altogether, we continue to target earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.35 for 2017. And that's up 3% to 5% year-on-year",,,
And when you see those cycles emerge where growth is more elusive you tend to hear more talk around consolidation and harvesting synergies,,,
"And that's the message that's been made very clear to our entire North American beverage Business, and Al and Kirk and the team are singularly focused on that",,,
"And looking at our categories, most of them have  private label has been pretty much as it always has been, but we did experience an up-tick in soup and in particularly in the broth area",,,

"Hey, David",,,
"And so the second quarter should be a good quarter for Refrigerated Foods, and that's what's leading us to say we do expect it to be a stronger performance for the full year",,,
"For this quarter, we had $0.12 per share charge related to asset impairments and restructuring activities, and a $0.02 per share net gain on the sales of assets and businesses, and a $0.01 per share loss on debt extinguishment",,,
"And more important and also very important is that we're always going to be very, very disciplined on price",,,
And that's true in all these things that we have,,,
"In addition, we're seeing increases in velocity each period as we regain distribution",,,
"The continued growth in Younique active presenter base, which has increased nearly 20% since we began our partnership coupled with the continued strong double-digit top line growth, is a testament to the ongoing success and viability of this business model",,,

"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details",,,
"And then, your first question was on Waterpik and just the contribution",,,
"As we go to the second half, not significant changes, as we're mostly hedged for a lot of those commodities, and dairy, as I think you know, there's not a lot of liquidity, and you can't really hedge that exposure",,,
"Today, well discuss our results in the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and the actions were taking to improve our performance and to position Campbell for long-term growth",,,
So we are always anxious to have strong trips into that environment,,,
"And as we mentioned in the comments, we think that there  I think everybody's been looking to say, okay, what was that factor that really drove that across the board, and common thinking tends to be the tax refund delay had a big impact",,,
"Then more importantly, where you expect the most incremental improvement to come in 2017 because the momentum",,,
"Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC",,,

We expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2% for the Consumer Domestic business,,,
I think it's about a couple hundred million gallons,,,
So the mix of improving our organics with a new change of mix and adapting to the new reality and the strong acquisition actually aims to reinforce our growth potential rather than dilute it,,,
We expect this to be a key growth driver in the second half and into next year,,,
And I mean part of it we feel like we have a competitive advantage in that area and want to make sure we thread that needle correctly,,,
"But that why I probably look at the full year number to be more predictive, our advertising spend overall was pretty similar to the prior year fourth quarter, but down a little bit sequentially",,,

We're very pleased on our progress here as this will enable us to offset continued foreign currency headwinds as well as provide funds to continue investing in higher growth international businesses,,,
This was evident also in the recent Unimonitor (52:02) report for 2016 calendar and is obviously proven by these first quarter numbers where we are growing in constant currency 9% versus the market which is probably closer to 4%,,,
"These category and channel positions are strategically important for long-term growth, but generally operate at margins below those realized by our retail brands",,,
So its tough out there for sure,,,
"So, the volumes are healthy in a lot of categories, so the real story is, when it comes to dollars, it's simply price; and, that's going to vary from category to category",,,
"As we've shared with you on March 1st, we know what we need to do to succeed",,,

"So in other words, we planned more trade support in the quarter",,,
"I have belief, and we watch volume, revenue and pricing very, very carefully on a weekly basis, I think where the market is today, when we can take pricing, we should take the pricing, and we have been trying to move the portfolio more to premium products, and the good news is that we are actually making progress in Frito-Lay to move the business more to premium products",,,

"I guess the only thing I'd add to that, Vivien, has been that the wholesalers have strategies around when they build their inventory in, when they decide to take their inventory down, which they're free, of course, to do",,,

"The pipeline is full, and we'll continue to work hard in that area",,,
Ill give you a few thoughts on Wii,,,
I don't want anybody to think we did invest in price in the quarter because we certainly did in a very big way and it's really the factors I talked about,,,
"So, we are in a situation from a channel diversification that we have more than one-third of the company growing in the high-20s and thats very, very strong",,,
"But on average, I just want to make you think that the growing part of the business is the non-promoted one",,,

"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc",,,
"continue to improve in the quarter, the seismic shifts weve described in the past continue to alter the consumer food and retail landscapes",,,
And I'll say a few things,,,
Are you talking about gross margin and the slowing of the gross margin percent improvement?,,,
And we've made numerous other elements of progress against a host of operational elements,,,
Organic pound volume reduced net sales growth by 7 points and was partially offset by 4 points of positive mix and net price realization,,,
20% of $750 million,,,
"So, I think the other segments continue to grow",,,
"As we anticipated, U.S",,,
"You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SCT increase",,,
I just want to start by thanking all of our employees for those solid Q3 results that we delivered,,,
C-store results are particularly strong with retail sales two times that of any other channel,,,
"We've see private label items come up, and we've also seen our Eggo items come up, which suggests that there are factors going on there",,,
So I think you should think about adding earnings from the destination marketing volume that is growing and hopefully picking up something like $6 per tonne versus our original FOB trade,,,
"So, I guess, I think combining the net revenue, double-digit growth and the growth of the presenters, that clearly makes us satisfied with the performance",,,
"In North America, our organic sales fell 3% in our consumer businesses, and that reflects the combination of category softness, greater competitive activity, and lower promotional shipments",,,
"And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market",,,
Do keep in mind as I said in prepared remarks was we do not have the expense of the plan in our estimates,,,
"There were all these competitive launches and then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is  because of industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them",,,
"We don't give that level of details, and I'm really sorry we can't give that",,,
"Consumers have a growing emotional attachment for their beauty experience, strong loyalty to product performance, a desire for high-touch service and a preference for experiential channels",,,
"And then finally looking at our International business, sales increased 3%, while volume declined 2%",,,
"Volume was up 4.5%, while average price was down 6.6% reflecting the lower cut-out",,,
"So, and then one other comment, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates that are listening in",,,
"We continue to work with key brick-and-mortar retailers related to their click-and-collect and omni-channel initiatives, as well as with established e-commerce players",,,
"We have growth in our brand dot-com, in our retail dot-com, and in platforms",,,
"From the start, Performance with Purpose has been more than a slogan",,,
"Thanks, Don",,,
We've made a number of changes to address this,,,

"Patricia, anything you want to add to that?",,,
"For example, in Chicago, for over a decade, we've been the title partner of the largest high school soccer tournament in the U.S",,,

"These investments in growth and capabilities should put us in an advantage position to win with retailers and consumers, and ultimately, deliver on our financial commitments on our strategy of balanced top and bottom line growth and build shareholder value",,,
The other the other thing Ali is that we feel pretty good about our cost savings going forward,,,
"Going forward in Europe, while we expect further improvement to our performance in the marketplace and across geographies, we expect Q2 organic top line and EBITDA to be held back by two factors: one, is shipments phasing versus the prior year where some July shipments were pulled into June last year; the second is the likelihood of unfavorable product costs as we will continue to face transactional foreign exchange headwinds within our supply chain in the near-term",,,
This benefited our Q1 results as we started getting this back,,,
"So, Jonathan, Younique is clearly an acquisition, a very strategic acquisition that we are very pleased with, and it continues to grow double digits",,,
"In addition, yesterday we announced that we're going to effectively sunset our U.S",,,
We expect this will negatively impact our U.S,,,
And I'm very much focused forward right now on those things,,,
"At the Kashi Company, sales remained pressured by last year's exiting of non-core or less profitable SKUs, promotions and categories",,,
We can far turn the luck in the latest quarter to a low single-digit decline,,,
"To recap, we're facing some challenges in C-Fresh beyond what we originally realized",,,
"While Im not satisfied with our results this quarter, Im also not deterred",,,
We know that that's working for our customers,,,
Good morning Ali,,,
And so we are trying to make sure we're innovating where the consumer is moving toward,,,
"As we continued to invest in price, we also remind you, Krogers investment in price can be seen very clearly if you look at our gross margins in the early 2000s compare to today",,,

Hi Alexia,,,
"So CNPC has moved out of Chile and is now operating in Brazil and moving into Peru and they're operating in Mexico, you know that's new geography for them and theyre obviously trying to get traction in launch",,,
So pretty much we had the commodity headwinds we faced this quarter being really responsible of the fact that the EBITDA decline,,,
"And as we enter our fourth quarter, we are further building momentum to deliver another year of strong profitable growth",,,
"But most importantly, the online sales allow us to reach consumers that sometimes we cannot reach with brick and mortar",,,
"Specifically in Costa Rica, we have opened 180,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility with a test kitchen and training facilities",,,
"And again, July, we did the majority of that and feel good about that",,,
"Third, weve established a distinct digital e-commerce business unit to address both pure play and omni-channel opportunities",,,
"We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward, and so we're going to talk about this next week",,,

We have a dedicated and growing cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plan in developing the next generation of online impulse solutions,,,
"That's very, very much so and as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter and we solved their insights, it's what caused us to aggressively start doing ClickList and the only changes we made was asking the Harris Teeter team if you had to do it over again, what would you do differently, those things we have done but the patterns that we're seeing would be very similar to what we saw -- what Harris Teeter saw before we merged and what Harris Teeter continues to see",,,
"So it's just driving the conversion from travelers to shoppers is an enormous opportunity to continuous traffic growth, and this isn't the end of the brands because this has a lot to do with investments we do in the current (49:45) or in the market of all regions",,,
The synergies are really net of any potential reinvestment et cetera,,,
"For example, Clinique and Origins each added more than 50 doors of Olive Young",,,
"Hugh, go ahead",,,
I think we see the retailer continuing to use the seasons as they have,,,
Good morning,,,
"The remaining one-third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is declining, partly due to category-wide consumer concerns about sugar",,,
So we keep growing market share,,,
"And the trial gain which is becoming more competitive is what we are all reacting to, improving our social media activation, our innovation, our activation in-store and all the rest",,,
"One, you know, we continue to invest where we want to grow and we're demonstrating growth on value-added products versus the commodity elements of our portfolio, and I'd say that's particularly in Chicken and Prepared Foods we see that very prominently",,,
Central to our success was pivoting our business to capture new consumers,,,
"On our Q4 call, we introduced new analytics to give you some insight into our broad line distribution portion of our food service channel, which serves predominantly local and regional food service operators",,,
"We have broadened our makeup offerings in travel retail to capture growing demand while Jo Malone growth has helped drive a reinvigorated fragrance business, and we are introducing some of our newer artisanal fragrance brands to airport locations",,,

"Consistent with these results, home care delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains",,,
Our early signs are good and we're following it up with further renovations and innovations in the second half,,,
We're also mindful of our expectation for the brand and its role in our portfolio as a reliable contributor,,,
"As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S",,,
"In many cases, yes",,,
We have time for one more question,,,
"And so we will continue to do that and, sorry, the last thing on Clinique is the makeup",,,
"Some of the multi-component products like Snack Mix, for example, where you're moving multiple ingredients to make the products",,,
"We said on prior calls that our  the three big brands that generally drive the international business are STERIMAR, BATISTE and  I forgot the third one",,,
We have moved those more out of retail and into working with schools to give kids healthier snacks,,,
"As a first step, we started to integrate the supply chain to reengineer the fresh operating model",,,
"Moving to the Professional Products business, it delivered strong sales growth in the quarter with continued strength in professional cleaning, driven by Clorox disinfecting wipes, Pine-Sol and Glad, aided in part by strength in B2B e-commerce channels",,,
Yeah,,,
"So, I think in an interesting way there's infinite possibilities to create impulse all through technology online, and I think as this market matures and evolves, you're going to see a lot of that happening, and we are focused on developing all of these tools ourselves with our e-commerce partners to make sure that we are responsive to them when they so choose to go that way",,,

"I mean importantly for us, there does not appear to have any significant effect on Marlboro or in L&M",,,
All our businesses are doing well,,,
"Although it will be a multi-step process, we continue to believe that candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long-term, when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing",,,
"And so, I think that's always something that we are thoughtful about as we go into any quarter",,,

"So certainly, that has an impact",,,
"And so at the end, the profitable brands are still the big brands with great hero product, great repeat, and not many small brands that generate a lot of noise on trial, because unless they get the repeat, they will not be sustainable",,,
"First, seeding and growing organic sales",,,
And there's been strong collaboration between our teams internally and our customer teams internally right all the way through this,,,

"Well, as Rodney said in response to an earlier question, we typically don't lead our market down on price, accepting categories where it's one of our strategic investments we're making",,,
"But, if those brands, they are our brands and the customers tell us they love it and one of the things that we probably should have done years ago but we hadnt but we actually, was much more aggressive on hiring a third-party company to do a broad test taste and quality preferences for our brands across multiple national brands and other companies private label programs",,,
"Adam, we've reviewed basically the underlying cost of capital model over the past several quarters",,,

"Within that, there was a couple of percent of discrete items",,,
"However, the higher specialty sales had a positive impact on gross profit",,,
The expenses with bird performance,,,
"As it relates to your question about the investing in the business, yes, we have continued to invest and part of that or I would say the majority of that, as it relates to synergies, have been closing some plants that were non-strategic as we consolidated volume into existing plants that we're heavily investing in",,,

"Our brands and products drive basket size and an extremely high velocity off the shelf, and therefore generate significant cash flow for our retail partners",,,
"So excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business",,,
"And third is that this brand is, as you said in your question, expanding into other categories beyond masks",,,
"Yeah, I guess I'd say, Ali, the year started out a little slow",,,
"Well, look, when it comes to vitamins, the category is healthy",,,
Our business is responding in the way we expected it to,,,
"So how much of it is broader economic slowdown, which you don't seem to be seeing in other areas? The job report was a little weak but not substantially so",,,
"As I stated earlier, a lower seasonal inventory build versus year ago at a key customer accounted for 7 points of the decline and 2 points were due to reduced consumer takeaway",,,

"So, beyond that, I dont believe we should be talking about the details",,,
So the first question around smart cart technology,,,

But I would say it's not anything unique or different this quarter than what we've been doing,,,
"Thank you, Ken",,,
"We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products",,,

Strong volume performance particularly in our U.S,,,
Thanks for calling,,,
And our point was that our company historically had been in the high single digits,,,
"So when you're looking at our of sales, our adjusted operating income then you will obviously see a 100% of the entities results coming through, but then when you're actually looking at an earnings attributable to our shareholders to the WBA shareholders, we strip out and align the proportion that is attributable to Prime itself and I think as we said we own just over 50% of the business",,,

"And on a fuel price neutral basis, cost-per-case increased by one penny",,,
"Despite the executional challenges, we remain confident in the growth potential of the Packaged Fresh category, and believe our C-Fresh strategy is sound",,,

"As I said before, our long-term algorithm is for the international business to grow 6% annually, and we're confident that we can deliver that",,,

Customer transitions have begun, with the first of our customer base being converted here in Q2. This will trigger the first of the list price adjustments, which will have an increasing impact as more customers get converted across Q2 and Q3. Keep in mind that we already have a fully-functioning warehouse system that is both efficient and scalable and is ready for this transition",,,

"One is that half of it is the shift of marketing that we've been talking about all year long, right we said we're going to move a lot of our Q4 spending into Q2 and Q3 to better line up with our new product launches",,,

We have a great warehouse system,,,
"And so, that's really  is what we were trying to refer to there",,,

Thanks Maria and good morning everyone,,,

"And in the UK, we launched Quaker Super Goodness in two forms, SuperGrains and Super Fruits, both made with 100% whole-grain oats with beta glucan, which has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels",,,
"For example, Este Lauder recently introduced new products to reinforce its two biggest franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, and it paid off, as both grew double digits",,,
And we think that this is important for this company to make these types of investments at this point in time in order to allow us to be a better company in the future,,,
"So growth rates have come down, there's still lots of competition including local competitors who are aggressively pursuing business and we're trying to make sure weve got the right innovation, we got the right price point, were executing well in market and that probably makes it a little tougher in this environment to get price increases, in a market like Brazil, where the category is going backwards 3% to 4% in volume and you're taking list price up, you can generate some short-term category value increases, you don't want it to be a race to zero either",,,
We actually think this could be a time when a lot of competitor balances could be reset,,,
"Adjusted OI margin increased 230 basis points to 15.6%, driven primarily by lower A&C spend, continued overhead management and a property insurance recovery",,,
"Yes, we can  I'll get Billy maybe to talk about the geography in a minute",,,
"And I just would like to add one thing on the top-line, which is  yeah, 4% to 5% organic plus acquisition is what we see today",,,
"And I believe that we did the right thing this time around by putting customers on allocation, not harvesting early, and keeping the quality of our carrot",,,
"I'd just say globally, our business is looking good",,,
"Additionally, but not unexpectedly, we also experienced some initial order softness during the few weeks in February when we were informing our DSD employees of our exit",,,

"Akshay, we saw that release earlier this week as well",,,
"So, I think those are all key drivers, what continues even as we start to see a little bit of slowing of the deflationary environment start to happen",,,
"So we're very confident about the returns, but what's important is to go in a straight line and do in a way where we keep the focus on the customer as we integrate the business on the service that we provide our patients rather than sometimes which you see, dare I say, I see in other businesses do, where they rush things and they don't execute properly",,,
But I guess the last thing I'd say is we feel very good about our 4% gross profit growth in the U.S,,,
"Globally, we continue to successfully launch additional brands online in more markets",,,
"We are stepping up marketing spending on Pepsi and Mountain Dew, including our zero and low calorie products under these trademarks",,,
"As I said at our inaugural investor day, when you take on a transformation of this magnitude there will be quarterly volatility in gross margin from time to time",,,

I dont think there is any specific thing thats happened in addition to that,,,
Our focus from here is to close out the year strong and make sure that we continue to make progress against the things that will drive positive momentum in 2018. This should play out on three fronts,,,
"Now, with the exception of bellies",,,
"Recall that Easter occurred on April 16th in 2017 compared to March 27th in 2016. Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing, and therefore, noise in the data, is by looking at absolute market share results",,,
"So, to think about  the way that we think about our M&A framework, which hasn't changed since the beginning, and the framework is pretty much that we want to own brands that we'd be happy owning these brands for the long run, brands with strong equity, strong relative market share, brands that can travel",,,
The biggest change would be -- continue to be milk and eggs across the country; everywhere else would be puts and takes,,,
But freestanding store outside of the U.S,,,
"Sure, sure",,,
Overall macroeconomic trends in the U.S,,,
"Yes, that's right",,,
"And, as such, we expect to see increased shelf space allocation, which coupled with a game-changing innovation coming to Clairol in the second half, should further boost the brand",,,

"While our core profit performance in the first half of the year was impacted by difficult economic conditions, we expect to see an improvement in core profit growth in the second half as we lap incremental investments from last year and we realize productivity from supply chain initiatives",,,
"Additionally, we expect Global Biscuits and Snacks to maintain its current momentum",,,
"No, not at all",,,
I think really it always looks at the year-to-date effective tax rate and if you look at that from an adjusted basis as I said that was around 24.5%,,,
"And in terms of distractions, clearly this is a big reorganization",,,
"Since then, we've steadily improved but have not returned to pre-recall production levels",,,
"Simple Meals, Canada and food service performed well and the Campbell Fresh turnaround is progressing",,,
"So, we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs, which as I said, is affecting our ability to grow",,,
"As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the retailer landscape is changing dramatically amidst intense competitive activity",,,
"What is tougher is to get the attention at the trial moment, because of the many small brands , there's more activity out there (55:42)",,,
Now let me come to the impulse nature of our products,,,
"And we've had remarkable success over many, many, many quarters",,,
"Hi, Rob",,,
"But I also think in the, A), with the cost savings programs we have been running, we have been doing lots of deep dives into whats working media, whats not working media and how do we make sure we are moving more of our dollars to work harder for us",,,
"This decrease primarily reflects a number of special items, including, as I said previously, the Rite Aid merger termination fees",,,
"And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, were really proud of the work that we started over a decade ago, and making sure natural and organic product is affordable to all customers, and we never felt like just because something is natural or organic, you should charge a premium for it",,,
"And as I said a little bit earlier, there is a bit of noise because of some of the shift in timing and what played into July, and how that may have affected some of the shelf resets, and we're working through that now",,,
"So, if we're getting a good return on that, we want to support the brands, and you know, it depends on which brand you're talking about, what the ultimate level is, the mix-out is going to be different depending upon what kind of traction we've got",,,
We would have said several years ago three to four was probably more what we were trending,,,

There were some weather-related issues,,,
We look forward to talking about our business in these plans in more details on the March 1 at our investor update,,,
Let me now discuss the focus of our fiscal year 2018 strategy,,,
"In the area of delivery, we are seeing progress in improved routing and delivery metrics through the leverage of enhanced technology",,,
"In contrast to retail, in food service, we play in primarily unbranded price-driven categories that are highly competitive and can be volatile as they absorb swings in commodity",,,
"As a part of the integration of Hillshire brands, we standardized the holiday and vacation policies across the company and transitioned to a singular competitive compensation structure",,,
"Hugh, did you want to add anything to that point?",,,
Category demand should remain strong and we have lots of innovation coming on Huggies including a new super premium diaper pants that we recently launched on Singles Day in November,,,
"Each of our operating sectors performance came in on or ahead of expectations with the numbers showing sequential topline acceleration, with the exception of our North American Beverages business, where net revenue and operating profit declined",,,
"So with that said, we'll turn to our prepared remarks",,,
Increasingly that is not really anywhere near the full story,,,
I wouldn't say it's a distribution game,,,
"So, that's a piece of work we are doing",,,
The Luxury division has been improving its revenue trends in parallel with decreasing wholesale distribution to create a healthy business,,,
Here's Billy for more details on our performance,,,

"If you look across Crackers, Cookies, Pop-Tarts, Cereal, Frozen, and Kashi, consumption was higher than our shipments in every case",,,
"Our power chocolate brands are growing and gaining share, and we're working on plans that should enable other parts of our CMG and snacks portfolio to see gains in the near future",,,
That looks to us to be pretty stable,,,
We'll do the best we can with that,,,
Thats what we are aiming for and working for,,,
"Dennis, do you want to comment on that?",,,
"Just for clarification, because were in the snacks category and many fresh categories, are you referring to the soup category?",,,
to China to the UK and tailoring that capability with retailers to fit their growth strategy,,,
"candy, mint and gum, or CMG, April year-to-date retail takeaway of about 2.5%",,,
"Solid growth, we are entering new markets",,,
Approximately 60% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category,,,
"Our kid brands momentum will continue, specifically with wholesome snacks",,,
"And so, I think that that's  it was good to hear that what we said is  was translated, I guess, by you in the right way",,,
And so I think to us thats confirmation that the things we are trying to do for these customers is working,,,
"We're up for that challenge, but there's other players in the neighborhood",,,
Absolutely,,,
"As we enter the new fiscal year, we do so with strong momentum and I believe fiscal 2018 will bring opportunities for Sysco",,,
"So bringing our statutory tax rates from 35% level to either at the 15% level that Mr. Trump has talked about or the 20% level that Republican Blue Print is talking about is very, very positive",,,

"So, excluding discretes, we were 25.2%",,,

Yes,,,
So those were two very specific things that we faced,,,
The recent improvements of the trend is in skin care where the millennials are also entering more than skin care business,,,

"So, I think we feel very good about where we're at",,,
"In terms of the category overall, trends were a little better in the last part of the first quarter, so we're cautiously optimistic that market growth will get back to more normal levels over time",,,
"Remember, though, most of DSD network will have to remain open through the transition",,,
"And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of",,,

Good morning,,,

And finally this quarter demonstrated that the PepsiCo portfolio does have the capacity to generate topline and bottom-line growth even in the occasional quarter where we see a downturn in a particular sector,,,

"Segment operating profit grew 6% for the full year, driven by lower input costs and benefits from our cost savings efforts",,,

"In terms of the international businesses, I think as we've said in the prepared remarks there is still the challenge in the U.K",,,
"I also think you're seeing more competitors, expanding into more markets",,,
"So, I actually believe it's a good thing",,,
"There's number one, inflation justified pricing; number two, trade efficiency, and I just talked a little bit about that; and three, premium-priced innovation which over time will be positive mix",,,

"I'd say that those are probably the two biggest drivers of the kind of shift in our performance, although I would say while we feel better about the quarter, we still feel like we have a lot of opportunity in the SYGMA side of the business",,,
So we continue to push that forward,,,
