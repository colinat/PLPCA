Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe,not_applicable,Positive,Confident
Mark?,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Sterling, Iâ€™ll take that question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think weâ€™re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well",,,Uncertain
"As you know thatâ€™s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering",,,
"And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter thatâ€™s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud",,Positive,Confident
"In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention",,,
"And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well",,,
"And also, there is no question that weâ€™re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes",,,
"So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings",,,
"And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks",,,Uncertain
"So, that continues to be strong as well",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Youâ€™re absolutely right,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think big picture, the conversations that weâ€™re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda",,,Uncertain
And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge,,,
"And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
And we're part of all of those conversations,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people",,,Uncertain
"But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do",,,
"But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution",,,Uncertain
"Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise",,,
"As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs",,,
And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new,,,
"And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past",,,
"As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services",products_services,Neutral,NIL
And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well,,,
"To your point, stock had a good quarter",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory",sales,Positive,Confident
"Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value","sales,acquisitions",Neutral,Uncertain
"And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well",,,
"It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise",,,
"There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than itâ€™s ever been",,,
"So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits",,,
I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us,,,
And the expectation is thatâ€™s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery,,,
"So, weâ€™re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, itâ€™s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in",products_services,Positive,Confident
"Let me take the second first, which is, youâ€™ll get an update as well as Summit",,,
So weâ€™re hoping a lot of will be at Summit,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think youâ€™ll be pleased with how quickly weâ€™ve been able to integrate the products,products_services,Positive,Uncertain
"And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven",,,
"Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics",,,
And I think the team has done a great job,not_applicable,Positive,Uncertain
But next week weâ€™ll give you a little bit of an update on that,,,
"On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about",,,Uncertain
This is a $40 billion TAM,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity",,,
But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that weâ€™re strong continues to be excellent,,Positive,Confident
I think we have a differentiated solution,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader",,,Uncertain
"But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith",,,
"The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop,products_services,Positive,Uncertain
So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product,products_services,Neutral,NIL
"So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest",,,
The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory,,,
"So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market",,,Uncertain
"And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide",,,Uncertain
And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else thatâ€™s out there,,,Uncertain
"Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right",,,
So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it,,,
"Now, I think in all three of those, weâ€™re continuing to make great progress",not_applicable,Positive,Uncertain
"And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant",,,Uncertain
Itâ€™s an area weâ€™ll continue to invest in,,,
"So, we feel good about it Derrick",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Youâ€™re absolutely right,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The good news is weâ€™re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
"I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas",,,
Where we think we have a world class organization that does that,,,Uncertain
"Because itâ€™s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that weâ€™re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects",products_services,Neutral,NIL
So I actually feel good about all of those,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but thatâ€™s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that",,,
"So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where weâ€™ve invested in over the last few years",,,Uncertain
"We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies",,,Uncertain
"And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that weâ€™re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense",,,Uncertain
And so we have done some when they make sense,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and weâ€™ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense",,,Uncertain
"I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about",,,Uncertain
"If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs",,,
"And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions",,,Uncertain
"And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, weâ€™re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
And the service that is top of mind for as Stock,products_services,Neutral,NIL
"So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on",,,
"And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business",,Positive,Uncertain
"But in addition to the great quarterly performance, weâ€™re really excited about the long-term opportunities that weâ€™ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves",not_applicable,Positive,Confident
"And I think weâ€™ll continue to be unique in that, weâ€™re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings","sales,earnings",Positive,Uncertain
"We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever",,,
"We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision",products_services,Neutral,NIL
But thank you for joining us today,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth,sales,Neutral,NIL
Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year ago period,sales,Positive,Confident
"CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better than normal seasonality, as significant growth in desktop processor sales driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales",sales,Negative,NIL

These new mainstream GPUs provide a compelling solution for the millions of gamers looking to upgrade their PCs to support advanced display technologies and deliver optimal gaming experiences,,,

"On the data center front, in March we demonstrated that our upcoming Naples server CPU would offer more cores, I/O, and memory bandwidth when compared to the highest-end dual socket x86 server CPUs currently available, resulting in better performance across multiple workloads",,,
Naples platform development work continued to accelerate in the quarter,,,
We are in the final stages of preparation in advance of launch and are very pleased with the status of our silicon and customer engagements,,,
"We have now seated thousands of Naples processors across an extensive set of OEMs, end users and partners, and remain on track for our first Naples products to launch this quarter",products_services,Neutral,NIL

Naples is the first step in our long-term plan to deliver a leadership data center product roadmap; complementing the success of our mainstream Polaris-based GPUs with our high-end Vega GPUs; extending our Zen core into the mainstream desktop and premium notebook markets with the launches of our Ryzen 3 CPUs and Ryzen mobile APUs in the second half of the year; and expanding our participation in the fast-growing market for GPU compute with the launch of Radeon Instinct Accelerators mid-year,products_services,Neutral,NIL

"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance",,,
"So look, we're very pleased with how the Ryzen launch went",,,
It was a big launch for us,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We did Ryzen 7 first early March and then Ryzen 5 here in the middle of April,,,
All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong,,Positive,Confident
"I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 eight-core devices, as well as the Ryzen 5 four and six-core devices",,Positive,Uncertain
"Relative to how it performed in the quarter, actually, it performed as we expected",,,
"So with a global launch, we were reaching many distributors and many channel partners, and I think that's gone well",,,Uncertain
"We did see some early shortages in terms of motherboards, and that was our motherboard partners ramping their supply in line with our CPU supply, but that was really dissipated after the first couple of weeks",,,
So nothing out of the ordinary there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we feel really good about where it is,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
So I think that's the next piece of the Ryzen launch for us,,,Uncertain
"But overall, I would say it went quite well",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Absolutely, Matt",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So if you look at our gross margin progression given the mix of our business, clearly, we made actually very nice progress year over year","sales,earnings",Positive,NIL
"So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points, and that was really on the strength of Ryzen","sales,earnings",Positive,NIL
"When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter",sales,Negative,NIL
And there will be a ramp of game consoles going into the second quarter,,,
So the relative mix of the business sees more gaming consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter,sales,Positive,NIL
So that's the reason for the sequential guidance,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But again, if you look year over year, Q2 2017 to Q2 2016, you'll see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,NIL
"Thanks, Matt",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Sure, Ross",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So as we go into the second quarter, we certainly are adding both the Ryzen 5 in addition to the Ryzen 7. So if we look at the forward guidance, up 17% quarter-on-quarter, that is driven by additional Ryzen, as well as a semi-custom ramp that I just talked about",,,
We are early in the ramp,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Everything that we see is â€“ we're getting positive reception throughout the ecosystem and we're going to continue with go-to-market activities, and as I mentioned, the OEM component of that will kick in in the second quarter",,,
"So on your first question, relative to the margins and how those look, I think they are â€“ the yields are as expected","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
So both the 16-nanometer and the 14-nanometer have done really well,,,
"And so, in terms of the new product ramp, the yields are as expected and per our margin structure","sales,earnings,products_services",Neutral,NIL
"And, Mark, maybe just to finish off the comment, I think, to your question, I think, we feel pretty good about our cost structure",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
We're always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time,op_costs,Positive,Confident
"But in terms of the margin expansion story, as we go through the year, it's going to be about the mix of business","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
"And as we get into the higher ASP, stronger product portfolio and that ramps to a larger piece of the business, that will be the margin expansion story","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"Thanks, Mark",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Absolutely, David",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So Vega is really a new architecture,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So it is focused on the price points above Polaris,,,
"We expect Vega to be a broad product for us that will go across the gaming segment, the professional workstation segment, as well as GPUs in the data center",products_services,Neutral,NIL
And we will be launching products across all of those segments with the Vega architecture in the next couple of months,products_services,Neutral,NIL
So the Polaris refresh for us is the RX 500 series that we launched just a couple weeks ago,,,
And that is what we would use in those mainstream price points in 2017.,,,
So we are on track to launch the rest of the Ryzen portfolio in PCs,,,
"We'll launch Ryzen 3 earlier in the second half, and then we will launch Ryzen mobile towards the holiday cycle for the second half",,,

I think certainly the Ryzen gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio,"sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
So I think that is true,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think when you look at the sequential â€“ there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we're ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter,"sales,op_costs,products_services",Neutral,NIL
"So overall, it was as we expected",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Maybe, Devinder, do you want to add to that?",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Stacy, maybe I just want to clarify because I want to make sure that we were clear",,Neutral,NIL
"So the masks were in OpEx and now they're going to be capitalized as they go into production, so they weren't in COGS before",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"I think it really is a full-year statement, and I think it's a recognition of, as we transition from 14-nanometer to 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer masks are substantially more expensive than 14. So I don't think you can exactly put it the way you put it",,,Uncertain
"But overall, I think what we're trying to do is basically as the mask sets become more sizable on the production level to capitalize them",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Thanks, Stacy",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, Ambrish, I think you should expect that we will expand margins as we go through the year","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
We do have this mix effect between Semi-Custom and new product revenue,"sales,products_services",Neutral,NIL
"But certainly, our exit velocity, as we exit the year, we should see â€“ when you compare year-on-year sort of Q4 2017 to Q4 2016, you should see the margin expansion","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So the full year guide is low double-digit revenue growth, 2017 to 2016. I think, given our product portfolio being very much influenced by the PC â€“ the Ryzen and PCs, Vega for GPUs as well as Naples from a server standpoint, we expect that the Computing and Graphics segment will be â€“ will grow more so than the EESC segment overall on a year-over-year basis, just given some of the consumer markets move faster than some of the data center and server markets","sales,products_services",Neutral,Uncertain
"So, look, we're really pleased with where we are with the Naples program right now",,,
"Overall, from a performance standpoint, the product and the customer engagements is going as we would expect",products_services,Neutral,NIL
We will launch here in the second quarter,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we'll start some low volume of revenue shipments during the second quarter that will ramp gradually into the second half of the year,sales,Neutral,NIL
"And so, overall, I think, that is how the server outlook will be",,,Uncertain
I think I have said before and I would still say that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
And so we would expect it to take a couple of quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time,products_services,Neutral,NIL
But you should see a number of customers announcing what AMD platforms over the next couple of quarters,,,
So we believe we're highly differentiated with Naples in the sense that we have more cores,,,
We have more memory bandwidth,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We have more I/O than our competition,competition,Neutral,NIL
"So for certain workloads, I think, Naples is going to do very, very well, certainly, in the cloud as well as in certain HPC workloads and big data workloads that can use all of that memory and I/O bandwidth",,,Uncertain
"We will be talking more about the positioning of Naples and the key workloads, as we go through the next couple of months prior to launch",,,
"But, certainly, we feel that it's, again, like Ryzen, on the strength of the Zen core, we have a very, very strong foundational product",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
And now it's about making sure that we help our customers get to market,,,
"Yes, John",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Lisa, can you hear me?",,,
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Yeah,,,
"Just quickly, Lisa, given that mix now is becoming quite important in trying to understand gross margin, I'd be kind of curious, what percent of your Compute business in the March quarter was based on Ryzen? And I guess, if you assume that all of the transitions to Ryzen eventually â€“ had that occurred in the March quarter, can you give us an understanding of how much better gross margins would have been? And then I have a follow-up","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
"All right, John, that might be hard for me to answer very specifically, but let me give you the high-level view",,,
"So we started selling Ryzen on March 2, and a good piece of it was â€“ basically for us positioning into the distributors",,,
"We take revenue on a sell-out model and so you should think about â€“ although, we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn't necessarily revenue them all in the quarter just given that we're on a sellout model for our revenue recognition",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"In terms of where we are in the transition, Ryzen, non-Ryzen, we still have a long ways to go",,,
"I mean, the way we should think about it is Ryzen 7 was at the very high-end",,,Uncertain
We're going to â€“ Ryzen 5 has started,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We have Ryzen 3 that will come next, and then we have the entire mobile portfolio as well",,,
So it will take us through this year to really transition the majority of the product over to Ryzen,products_services,Neutral,NIL
"I think everything that we've seen, the ASP uplifts are definitely very beneficial",,,Uncertain
"And so, we're pleased with sort of the pricing that we're commanding for the product and the reception for the product",products_services,Positive,Dodgy
So I think it's just â€“ it will take us a couple of quarters to transition the overall portfolio over to Ryzen,,,Uncertain
"John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Lisa, as a follow-up to that, I know you guys are coming up with an Analyst Day next month and some of these targets might change",,,
"But to the extent that your old gross margin target was sort of 36% to 40%, I'm just kind of curious","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
"To what extent can you get to that 38% midpoint just by moving your current market share mix towards Ryzen? And to what extent does getting to 38% or above imply either market share gains in the Compute business on the desktop, notebook side or on the server side? How do I think about that dynamic?",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So the long-term guidance, 36% to 40%, I think we have multiple ways of getting there",,,Uncertain
"Certainly, on the PC side, it is not anticipating that we gain a significant amount of share over our historical numbers",,,
"So I think the idea on the PC side is, again, I think 2017, a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"I think as you go into 2018, you'll see a larger percentage of that be in servers",,,Uncertain
"But to the fundamental question, I think we feel good that the mix dynamics are there, the product is strong enough to command the right ASPs that we can get to the long-term margin targets several different ways","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,Uncertain
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you,,,
"Thanks, John",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So without commenting on the exact numbers between Semi-Custom and Ryzen, I think, it's fair to say that the Semi-Custom business will have a reasonable ramp in the second quarter as will Ryzen",,,Uncertain
"In terms of relative to our expectations, it's actually very close to our expectations of what we expected the ramp rate to be, as we're going into this new segment",,,

We normally see the seasonality going from Q4 to Q1 that sales go down,sales,Neutral,NIL
We saw something very normal to that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

So we see the gaming segment as healthy,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"From what we see, I think we feel good about the gaming segment overall",,,Uncertain
Graphics continues to be a strong segment,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"For us, it's not just the channel business, but it's the ramp of our OEM business",,,
So we have a number of new OEM systems that are also ramping here in the first half of the year,,,

"So yes, overall, I think, we feel good about the market",,,Uncertain
Maybe let me start on the OpEx and then have Devinder comment on the second piece of the question,,Neutral,NIL

And then relative to the,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, Joe, the way to think about that is for the Ryzen 7 and a good portion of the Ryzen 5, we really didn't have a competing product in that segment, so it's really additive",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
We've actually added Sam [Samsung] to our CPU market coverage,,,
The legacy products will continue in the market,products_services,Positive,Confident

The general reception has been very positive,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I would say that interest level is very high,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In fact, we're adding additional customer support to really ensure that we help customers get their platforms up and running",,,
"In terms of what to expect in the revenue ramp, we started shipping early volume in the second half of June",sales,Neutral,NIL
We would expect that we continue to ramp that revenue through the second half of the year,sales,Positive,Confident
We would expect some additional customer announcements in the second half of the year,,,
"And then as we stated with both cloud and the enterprise accounts, depending on their qualification cycles, it can take anywhere up to four quarters to qualify the parts",,,
But so far so good,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think very good traction, and we continue to lean in hard on the datacenter opportunities",,,Uncertain
"Sure, Mark",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So certainly the overall quarter for Graphics was strong,,Positive,Confident
"Q2 tends to be seasonally down, and we were up in the quarter",,,
So it was better than seasonal,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I would say the better performance was due to two things,,,
"First of all, we did launch our RX 580 and RX 570 gaming cards in April",,,
"And those cards are very, very well-positioned in the market, so they're doing well with gamers",,,
"Relative to cryptocurrency, we have seen some elevated demand",,,
"If you look at GPUs across the world, the inventory in the channel is actually quite lean",,,
And so we're working on replenishing that inventory,,,
"Our priority, though, really is on our core market, which is the gaming market",,,
And so a couple of things that we are certainly doing are we're prioritizing supply towards the gaming market,,,
"So you'll see system integrators, as well as on some of the major e-tailers we have bundles with Ryzen and Radeon",,,
"And then some of our partners are also offering mining specific cards that have a different feature set, such that we're really segmenting the market between gaming and mining",,,
"But it's important to say we didn't have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we're not looking at it as a long-term growth driver",sales,Neutral,NIL
But we'll certainly continue to watch the developments around the blockchain technologies as they go forward,,,

"And the important thing, particularly in the enterprise market, as well as the commercial market, having a road map â€“ a strong road map with multiple generations is important",,Positive,Confident
We stated at our Financial Analyst Day that we're already investing heavily in 7-nanometer,,,
The 7-nanometer will be key for us on both the CPU and the GPU side,,,
And I would say that development is progressing well,,,
We're working with multiple foundries on that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We have multiple design teams that are working, and we expect that that will give us a strong competitive road map for the next several generations",,Positive,Confident
"No, I think you covered it, Devinder",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On the investment front, Matt, just to give you a little bit more color on that, I think we see tremendous opportunity in the datacenter around both CPU and GPU compute",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
And so we're taking the opportunity with some of the strength in the business to make sure we lean in to those resources and fully pay off the product investments,"products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
"Good question, Ross",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"When you take a look at our client business, think of it as desktop and mobile",,,Uncertain
"And then within the desktop segment, it's channel and OEM",,,
So Ryzen performed very well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think the ASP contribution is very evident on the desktop line item,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"But when we look at where we are in the progression of the Ryzen rollout, we're still in the early innings",,,
So we had our first full quarter of Ryzen Desktop in the channel,,,
"The OEMs launch their desktop products in about mid-June, and so they just started selling at the end of June",products_services,Neutral,NIL
And that will flow through into the second half of the year,,,
And the mobile products are still our legacy products,products_services,Neutral,NIL
"So you saw the mobile ASPs were down slightly as we went from Q1 to Q2, and that was just a mix on some of the legacy business",sales,Neutral,NIL
But the desktop ASPs were quite strong,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And we should expect that as we go into the second half of the year and we have Ryzen really take off in the OEM sectors as well as once we introduce Ryzen Mobile towards the second half of the year is when you'll see sort of more of the full portfolio over to Ryzen,,,
So I think you summarized the revenue guidance well,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
I think we see the Computing and Graphics business accelerating on the strength of the new products,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
We do have a bit of a year-over-year headwind when we compare game consoles,,,

"Sure, Ambrish",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So I think from an overall standpoint, we see strong demand in graphics for the third quarter",,Positive,Uncertain
I think that's a mix of a couple things,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
That's a mix of gaming being seasonally stronger in the third quarter,sales,Positive,Confident
That's a mix of inventories being very low in the channel,sales,Neutral,NIL
"And there is a crypto â€“ probably, a cryptocurrency component as well relative to overall demand",,,
"When we look at it as a whole, though, we think that the growth in the business is really on the strength of the products and how the design wins, both OEM and as well as system integrators are improving",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Now, how is it different than sort of a couple of years ago? I think we understand the market much better from the standpoint of the products are significantly stronger",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
"And so if you look at the product portfolio, not just the current sort of Polaris or RX 5 Series products, but the Vega product coming in, really opens up a larger TAM for us",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"And we are working with our add-in board partners to segment the markets in terms of the feature set that go into the cards, as well as prioritizing some of the gamer ecosystems",,,
So in terms of system integrator supply as well as bundling and OEM supply,,,
So I think we are doing quite a bit to make sure that we protect against any downside as it relates to cryptocurrency,,,Uncertain

"I mean, it all starts as a good product or a great product",products_services,Positive,Confident
And so I think the EPYC product performance is very important,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
But I think the other conditions that are different and perhaps even more favorable than in the past is the fact that the cloud datacenter guys are making up such a large piece of the market and they tend to move faster in their qualification cycles given the fact that they have more control of their own software environment,,,Uncertain
So I think our differentiation is strong,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think we have â€“ we put out a product that is not only strong on basic CPU performance, but also offers much more flexibility in terms of what you can do with memory and I/O",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
I think that value proposition is recognized by the customer set,,,Uncertain
So we certainly are looking to ramp the revenue as fast as possible,sales,Neutral,NIL

"We expect to spend approximately $90 million and $96 million, excluding equity compensation",,,
It's also worth noting that our planned investment increases in product innovation and scaling our platform will impact CapEx as well as OpEx as we capitalize more R&D development,"products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
"As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017. In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 14. Thank you,,,
And now Tom and I would like to take your questions,,,
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, I'll take that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"But as Tom said, for both of these products, Bot Manager launched earlier in the year, Image Manager launched mid-year",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"Bot Manager in particular, this is the fastest-growing product we've had in a long, long time, and so the penetration is still early days",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio",sales,Neutral,NIL
"You'll see that continue to ramp and further penetrate in 2018, but it's probably going to take a couple of years to see it kind of fully penetrated",,,
"As an example for Cloud Security, which we've been in market now for a little over four years",,,
I think about 38% of our customers via Cloud Security Solutions,,,Uncertain
"So still a lot of ramp to go even in Cloud Security, so it takes a while to have those customers ramp, but you can certainly see that we started a few years ago from roughly a few million dollars in Cloud Security to now over $400 million",,,
"So I think these new product offerings are kind of again proof points to Tom's comments that innovation is alive and well, and there's more to sell to the installed base to accelerate growth of the company",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're in a good position with the DDoS solution because of our unique distributed platform,,,
"We're in a position to defend and absorb the largest attacks out there, and we've got a great track record and there's a lot of other folks that offer scrubbing services or DDoS services of one kind or another, and they've all pretty much had high profile failures",products_services,Positive,Confident
"AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"For DDoS, it would be a different kind of approach",,,
So we don't see that as being a significant threat to the DDoS business,,,
"And DDoS is relevant for most of our customer base, so there's a lot of cross-selling that takes place and the Security Services, in general, were leading with a sale there and a lot of new accounts where they will join with Akamai because either our DDoS solution or our application layer protection capabilities with Kona and that brings new customers to Akamai",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"As we talked about, they're now collectively less than 10% of our revenue so the future impact is obviously limited, and we expect to see some further decline, but nothing to scale that we've seen over the last one to two years",sales,Negative,NIL
"Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback","organic_expansion,acquisitions",Neutral,NIL
"And as we talked about, our share buyback is intended to offset dilution, but it's a programmatic trade that buys more shares when the stock price is lower and buys fewer shares when the stock price is higher",,,
"But we have ample firepower to do full CapEx purchases, share buyback and M&A","organic_expansion,acquisitions",Neutral,NIL
We're certainly going to see a step-up in head count investments,organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
"You're right that we have a little bit more head count ramp here in the fourth quarter, but we hired for the year about a little over 400 people, I think, including some acquisitions",acquisitions,Neutral,Uncertain
"I think in years past, we averaged more than 1,000 hires per year",,,Uncertain
"I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation","products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"There's also investment we're going to need to be making in our service delivery enablement that I mentioned, that our Services business is growing quite rapidly","products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
And we're going to be making investments in continuing to scale the platform,organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
So you should expect head count more similar to what it's been in the past than basically what it's been in 2016. Unknown Speaker Okay,,,
And then just kind of a quick follow-up,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Jim, you did say just in terms of looking at the Q1, we can expect a bigger sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 on a revenue basis than typically we've seen, and just wanted to understand how much of that is being driven by, like you said, the outperformance on the Media side? And how much of that is a continued expectation of â€“ and I know it's not as significant as before but just the continued declines of revenue from the top six Internet Platform Customers?",sales,Negative,NIL
"Well, yeah, I mean, as Tom mentioned that we probably will see continued decline in the Internet Platform Customers in the first quarter; one, because seasonally they declined Q4 to Q1 anyways, because they also have a seasonally stronger Q4. But I'd say the bigger component of it is not that, and it's more that we had a very strong Q4 for Media",,Positive,Confident
"Media traffic was kind of seasonally very, very strong",,Positive,Confident
"We had a large number of gaming releases, a fair number of software download events that the Media business can be a bit spiky that way",,,
"So some â€“ I'd say the bigger part of the sequential decline is driven by the Media business, certainly not the performance in Security Solutions",,,
Unknown Speaker Got it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think it's also fair to comment that even outside of Media that I think the company is certainly much more diversified now than it was kind of even a year ago or two years ago, that our performance in Security business now represents 60% of the company's revenue, you include kind of services, call it 70-plus percent of the revenue","sales,products_services",Neutral,Uncertain
"So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business",sales,Neutral,NIL
So I think what you're going to see going forward is that you're going to see more stability in the company's growth rates,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"I do think that there is an opportunity for Media to reaccelerate growth rates, but I think the catalyst for that is really going to be a significant uptick in Over the Top viewing",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
And I think we're seeing steady growth in that area right now,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"But if you see that become more mainstream, I think we're poised to benefit significantly from that",,,Uncertain
"Yeah, I'll parse that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, certainly on the OTT side that, yeah, we're seeing very steady growth in OTT",sales,Neutral,NIL
"It's been that way for some time, but it's steady growth, so it's much more consistent growth in Over The Top than say gaming or software downloads, which tend to be much more variable based on games that get released or software updates that occur",sales,Neutral,NIL
And I'd say that has been the bigger catalyst driving growth in the Media business that those â€“ the gaming and the software download area tends to be much more spiky,sales,Neutral,NIL
And you'll have surges at times and then it won't at other times,,,
So I think the catalyst for growth in the Media business is going to be OTT,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
I don't think you're going to see the catalyst,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"You may see even a catalyst, as Tom mentioned, as you see more VR and things like that in the gaming space that require performance to work well, but I think that between things like that and OTT, that's going to be the cause of kind of re-acceleration in the Media business",,,Uncertain
"And on your CapEx question, I'm glad you asked, because we certainly are not trying to signal that we're doing a build-out for some anticipation of further OTT",organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
"Actually, the build-out that we're doing is, as you can imagine, our Security business now is on an annualized run-rate of over $400 million",,,
It's rapidly growing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And so there's build-out we're doing to support our Security business,,,
And there's also build-out that we're doing with our secure delivery network,,,
"More customers want to have their traffic served over a secure delivery network, so we're building out capacity in that area",,,
So it's really for other parts of the business,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's not so much for the Media business,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks for the question, Colby",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, we'll cover it more at the upcoming Investor Summit, but I still think the long-term model for the company in the low 40s is the right one",,,Uncertain
"I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
And I think what you're going to see is we're going to make investments in those areas,organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017. And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"But I do think that once those businesses get to a level of scale, because they'll be kind of early-stage businesses, I think once they get to scale, I think that we will be able to get the company model back to the low 40s EBITDA",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
"But I think that even beyond 2017, we intend to operate the company in the high 30s",,,Uncertain
"And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
"But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
We want to make sure we're investing to capitalize on that because now is the opportunity,,,
"Yes, yes",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
That means we were 14% in 2016. We'll be back in the 16% to 18% range in 2017.,,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I would say that the more of the growth has been coming from selling more into our installed base,sales,Neutral,NIL
We've been able to take the offerings that we have and further penetrate them into the installed base,,,
"I think Tom's right that Security's been a product category that we've been able to penetrate with new customers, and then once you get in you can Land and Expand them",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
You can expand it via other offerings,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base,organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
And there's still a significant opportunity to do more there,,,
"I mentioned earlier that 38% of our customers buy security, so that means there's an opportunity for 62% of customers to actually buy one of our Security Solutions",,,
"And so I think you're going to see that we're going to further penetrate the offerings, and I think as we bring more innovation to the table, there's more of an opportunity to sell more into the installed base",,,Uncertain
"And then I think you're going to see us do more in the way of new customer acquisition, Land and Expand model, and I think some of the new offerings are actually going to help us with that",acquisitions,Neutral,Uncertain
"Well, I think, again, I think you should look at our depreciation expense (54:31) as a percent of revenue to take the depreciation expense that we've been incurring as a percent of revenue","sales,op_costs",Neutral,Uncertain
"And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way","sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
We don't really operate on an overflow basis,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So it's whatever you're seeing is not really attributed to that,,,
I don't think there's really been a fundamental change in the Internet platform companies in terms of their utilization quarter-to-quarter,,,Uncertain
"Generally, the trend that we expect to see is they're going to try to do more of the delivery themselves",,,
"Obviously, they'll take the easier stuff and work on that first",,,
That's one thing that we've seen in the past,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
That said this stuff is hard to do and to do well and actually to do affordably,,,
So I think that we will continue to have business with these customers,,,Uncertain
I just think it'll be a lower percentage of revenue going forward,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
No,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think you're going to see a steady increase in investment throughout the year,organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
You won't see it manifest itself significantly because it's going to take a while to get the head count on board and the spending to ramp,,,
"So I think you're probably going to begin to see that effective in Q2. And then my expectation is that, again, it'll stay in the high 30s thereafter",,,Uncertain
"So I think you'll probably â€“ I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
But I do expect that kind of in Q2 and beyond that it's going to operate in the high 30s,,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, part of that is, again, when you talk about acceleration, you're talking about year-on-year",,,
"So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago",sales,Negative,Dodgy
"My comment was more of a sequential comment that Q4 to Q1 we always see some seasonal declines in the company revenues and also with these big customers, and I expect to see that happen",sales,Negative,NIL
"And as I mentioned, I think some of the seasonal decline is going to be much more notable in the Media business, and I think you're going to see steady growth in the Performance and Security business",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Yeah, roughly, yes",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I wasn't referring to a specific timeframe,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think you know the company has been operating in double-digit revenue growth,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
This is actually the first year we have not,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think you know that certainly the driver of that has been what's been going on with these large Internet Platform Customers,,,Uncertain
The company growth rate outside of them has been growing in the mid-teens,sales,Neutral,NIL
So we have been growing in the double-digits,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019. And I think that is what's going to lead to consistent double-digit growth for the company","sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"We're pretty pleased with our international growth, but you're right that our international growth has been growing very fast and growing very fast particularly in our Asia-Pacific region",sales,Positive,Confident
"So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank",organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
Our investments are not heavily weighted towards more go-to-market,organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation â€“ we will make some investments there,organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
It's a matter of giving our existing sales force more products to sell,"sales,products_services",Neutral,NIL
"Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue","sales,products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"And we've proven we can do that, Security being the most recent example",,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of â€“ it starts with customers that really, really care about performance",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
"And so I think we have a further room there, but I think that kind of the customers that are going to buy Ion â€“ many of them are already buying their products",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"While there's more to sell there, I'd say that probably not a significant, significant opportunity there",,,
"And, yeah, we have seen when customers upgrade to Ion that there is an ARPU uplift at times, but I also think there's other things to sell for our Web Performance Solutions",,,Uncertain
"As Tom mentioned, Image Manager is another offering to sell into the installed base",,,
"So if they're buying Ion, now they can buy Image Manager",,,
"If they're DSA, now they can buy Imagine Manager",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And I think you're going to see us have other adjacencies like that within Web Performance as well,,,Uncertain
"And then back to the top six customers of platform customers, is there any change you guys are seeing in terms of your share of the traffic that you're delivering relative to what the platform company may be doing themselves for using a multi-CDN strategy for?",,,

"Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers",sales,Neutral,NIL
"This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably",sales,Neutral,NIL
"It is important to note that while the pricing environment in the Media business remains highly competitive, aggregate price per bit declines remain roughly within historical norms",,,
"As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities",sales,Neutral,NIL
"And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online",sales,Positive,Confident

Operator? Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business",,,
So that has not changed,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business,sales,Neutral,NIL
"Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter",sales,Neutral,NIL
So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March,,Positive,Confident
"And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations",,,
"But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term",,,
"And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times",,,
"But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company",,,Uncertain
"Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers",,,
"I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company",sales,Positive,Confident
"The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens",sales,Positive,Confident
So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned,sales,Neutral,NIL
"Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business",,,
And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate,,,Uncertain
So it's not uncommon to go through these periods,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming",sales,Neutral,NIL
"That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent",,,Uncertain
So we're bullish about the prospects for media,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media",,,Uncertain
I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance,,,
We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers,products_services,Neutral,NIL
And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%,sales,Neutral,NIL
"So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming",,,
"We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services",products_services,Positive,Confident
So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint,,,Uncertain
"At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about",sales,Neutral,NIL
"Well, let me start and then I can have â€“ Tom can talk a little about the products",products_services,Neutral,NIL
I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million,,,
Five years ago this was just a idea,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So this business is growing very, very rapidly",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base",sales,Neutral,NIL
"So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business",,,
"And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings",,,
This is not license model,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion,,,
"So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those",sales,Neutral,NIL
Those were more technology tuck-ins,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions","sales,acquisitions",Neutral,NIL
"No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets",sales,Neutral,NIL
"And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets",sales,Positive,Confident
"We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe",sales,Neutral,NIL
"They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA",sales,Neutral,NIL
And that's probably not uncommon,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated,,,
And you could take the OTT question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be","sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected",,,Uncertain
"So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic",organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx,organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
"Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx",organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
"The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation","products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow,organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections,"sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
"I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer",,,
"So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half",,,
"I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
And so we don't want to curtail investment there,organic_expansion,Neutral,NIL
"And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case","sales,organic_expansion",Negative,Uncertain
I think we're really talking about Media in particular,,,Uncertain
"I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA",earnings,Neutral,NIL
"There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly",,,
And I forgot what your second question was?,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be,sales,Neutral,NIL
You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon,,,
So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens,sales,Neutral,NIL
"But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again",sales,Neutral,NIL
So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits,,,Uncertain
"I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them","products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
"And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making","earnings,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
"And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly,,,
"You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
That's a bit of the nature of the Media business,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates,"sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,NIL
I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company,,,Uncertain
"I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about",,,Uncertain
"And it's been that way for a long, long time",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier",,,
The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities,,,
"But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers",competition,Negative,Uncertain

"The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
I think it's going in the other direction,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before",,Neutral,NIL
I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward,,,Uncertain
So I don't see that's an issue,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure",,,
"And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery",,,Uncertain
So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward,,,
"If anything, it's going in the other direction",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease",,,Uncertain
"And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens",competition,Neutral,Uncertain
"You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic",,,
"So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels",,,Uncertain
"I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps",,Neutral,NIL
And the best part is we've got a lot of new products,products_services,Neutral,NIL
"There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile",,,

"If we look at the results, it was a little bit of a noisy fourth quarter for LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data due to expiry",,,
"Not only do we have more AIR MILES redeemed and expected due to heavy media attention to the issue, but also had a new law and act in Ontario of Canada which forced a one-time charge",,,
"Removed the noise though and it was a terrific 2016. Let's start with pro forma revenue of $7.4 billion, up 15% from 2015. We estimate that elevated redemption activity in Q4 added about $175 million or 3% growth to 2016. Essentially, AIR MILES that would have redeemed in 2017 were instead redeemed in 2016 ahead of the expiry, creating a pull forward of revenue recognition to 2016. Adjusted for that, revenue was approximately $7.2 billion, up 12% and consistent with the guidance",sales,Positive,Confident
"Core EPS was $16.92, up 12% from 2015 and $0.02 better than guidance",,,

Let's begin with BrandLoyalty which had a terrific year with high single-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA","sales,earnings",Neutral,NIL
Expansion efforts in Canada continued to exceed expectations and U.S,,,
market could be a growth driver in 2017 based upon early successes,sales,Neutral,NIL
"For AIR MILES it was tumultuous year with all the publicity surrounding the upcoming miles expiration date, AIR MILES issued increased 1% for 2016, below our expectations for about 3% as sponsor promotions dropped in Q4 as there was simply too much noise in Canada to be effective",,,
"We believe issuance growth will return to 3% range in 2017. In addition, we reduced the breakage rate for the AIR MILES Dream [ph] program for 26% to 20% at the end of 2016. The first 1.5 point reset resulted from higher than expected Q4 redemption activity",sales,Neutral,NIL
This is a normal change in accounted estimate and is reflected in our operating results,,,
"However, the second 4.5 point reset is different and that it was driven by the enactment of a new law and one-time event, thus we headed it back for adjusted EBITDA and core EPS purposes",earnings,Neutral,NIL
Flipping over to Epsilon,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It was a disappointing year for Epsilon as revenue increased 1% while adjusted EBITDA decreased 6%, both substantially less than our 5% growth expectations for '16. Breaking down revenue by key offering, let's start with the good â€“ collectively auto, CRM, affiliates and data grew revenue, double digits compares to 2015. In addition, after a slow start to 2016, due to the pull back of a large client, agencies growth rate turn positive in the back after the year","sales,earnings",Negative,Uncertain
Let's now shift to the problem childs; technology platform growth turn negative mid-year due to some flying attrition,sales,Neutral,NIL
"In addition to non-core offering, essentially the old-value click business was a consistent issue all year as we endeavor to pivot it towards a more of a data-driven solution",,,
This offering alone was a 3-point drag to Epsilon's revenue growth,sales,Neutral,NIL
"Turning to adjusted EBITDA, we start off the year in a big hole, down 22% in Q1. By significantly lowering our expense base, we cut that to a modest 9% in Q2, turn to flat in Q3 and then up 30% in Q4. We believe that our lower expense base will enable us to be more price-competitive on certain product offerings going forward","earnings,op_costs,products_services",Neutral,NIL

As a percentage of average card receivables, operating expenses decreased 50 basis points compared to 2015. Average receivables growth remained robust at 24% for 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA net was flat at $440 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. A $72 million reserve billed at Card Services and a $17 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES due to the breakage reset at the end of 2016 dampen the growth rate for the quarter,"earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"As delinquency trends moderate over the course of 2017 consistent with a wedge the quarterly reserve billed will moderate while the year-over-year hole in AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA should close this program changes or implemented over the course of 2017.

"First, that Epsilon could return to positive revenue in adjusted EBITDA growth and that we could stabilize the technology platform offering","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"We would say weâ€™re on track; especially I view it as very strong Q1. Second, the credit normalization will conclude by the end of 2017 with a check as weâ€™re definitely tracking to the wedge on Slide 11. Third, that we can retool the AIR MILES model to replace loss to EBITDA from the breakage reset",earnings,Positive,Confident
"Weâ€™d say that still in the process, but we do expect EBITDA margins to increase appreciably especially in the back half of 2017. Turning to capital allocation, we were active with our repurchase program during the first quarter, spending $415 million of the $500 million board authorization to acquire 1.7 million shares","sales,earnings",,
Letâ€™s go to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne,,,
"Weâ€™ll start with AIR MILES, and AIR MILES revenue decreased 6% to $181 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is largely due to a 4% decline in AIR MILES redeemed which was expected given the elevated redemption activity in 2016. The burn rate which were miles redeemed divided by miles issued was still elevated during the first quarter of 2017 due to a backlog that carried over from 2016. But we expect it to normalize at about a 78% burn rates for full year 2017. AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA decreased 32% to $35 million or a 20% EBITDA margin","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
"The decrease was primarily due to the lower breakage rate entering 2017, as you recall itâ€™s now 20% versus historically it was 26% and that knocks about one cent or one penny off profitability per mile redeemed",earnings,,
This is the whole weâ€™ve talked about before,,,
We are focused primarily on lowering the cost per mile redeemed by negotiating better vendor pricing and we started to see results in March,op_costs,,
"From a collector standpoint, our active collector statistics overall are down from last year but on par with 2015 levels",,,
"Our promotions in market such as a recently completed cruise promotion where every mile earned during the qualifying period was an entry into one of 1,300 cruise packages are stimulating issuance per transaction which is positive news",,,
BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% to $152 million and 14% to $24 million respectively compared to the first quarter of 2016. The declines are largely due to program timing between years as well as unfavorable FX rates been a 3-point drag on both,"sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
"Thereâ€™s really nothing new to report on the North American expansion effort at this time, but there were several high potentials for 2017. Letâ€™s flip to the next slide and discuss Epsilon",organic_expansion,,

"This offering turn quickly in 2016 as growth rates went from plus 5% growth in Q1 to flat in Q2 to minus 4% in Q3 and then minus 13% in Q4.

"Lastly Conversant Agency was down 28% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This offering has been a consistent drag now for about nine quarters, but itâ€™s now reaching a level where at less than 5% of Epsilonâ€™s revenue, it appears to be stabilizing",sales,Negative,NIL
Letâ€™s turn to Slide 6 and talk about Card Services,products_services,,

Operating expenses increased only 3% to $360 million for the first quarter and expressed as a percentage of average card receivables decline to 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016 that is a very strong start to the year in terms of expense leveraging","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"Adjusted EBITDA net increased 8% to $331 million for the first quarter of 2017, despite a $72 million billed allowance for the loan losses and as we talked about before that number should drop in Q2 and Q3.

"Average card receivables increased 14%, just under $16 billion, consistent with our expectation of mid-teens growth while credit sales increased 5% to $7.4 billion",sales,Positive,Confident

The net loss rate was 5.5% for the third quarter 2017. A substantial improvement compared to the 6.2% loss rate in the second quarter of 2017 and better than our expectations,earnings,,
"Importantly, gross loss rates were flat with the third quarter of 2016, even excluding the slight benefit from the hurricanes, which I'll talk about later",earnings,,
"Recovery rates are still down year-over-year, pressuring the net loss rate, but we consider this pressure to be transitory as we shift collections back to internal",earnings,Negative,NIL
Our delinquency forecast continues to suggest flat to lower loss rates in 2018. This trend allowed us to slightly drop our reserve rate during the quarter while maintaining 12 months of forward coverage,earnings,Negative,Uncertain
Now the question everyone has been asking what was the impact of the hurricanes,,,
"We estimate the hurricanes reduced our credit sales by approximately two points, reduced our revenue by about $40 million for the quarter or about 100 basis points negative impact to gross yield and benefited our loss rates by about 15 basis points","sales,earnings",,
"So what that means to our gross loss rates were down 18 bps year-over-year, take away the 15 basis points for the improved from the hurricanes, and that's roughly the flat year-over-year change in our gross loss rates",earnings,Negative,NIL
It is important to remember that this is a temporary impact,,,
"Under FEMA-designated individual assistant disaster areas, affected cardholders are not required to make payments nor will any interest or late fees be assessed for two month period",,,
Hurricane Irma will impact us early in the fourth quarter and then operations will return to normal,op_risks,,
"With that, I will turn it over to Ed",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yes, so there's two things I'd point you, Dan",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First is the gross yield decline year-over-year makes the percent growth look a bit higher, the 16% you referred to",sales,Negative,NIL
"If you had basically the same gross yields year-over-year, you'd see it flat-flat",,,
"As a percentage of AR, it moved a nominal amount",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We said, going back to the last quarter, we expected our operating expenses to be better this year, 40 to 50 basis points",op_costs,,
I think that's still on track,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We would tell you we're still in the process of adding collectors,,,
And we'll staff them up over the remaining of Q4. I would still expect the OpEx leveraging in Q4 to be better year-over-year,,,
"That said, we're still very much on trend to that guidance we gave last quarter of about 40 to 50 basis points improvement on an annual basis",,,
That'd be correct as well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But let's say we hadn't had the influence of the hurricanes affecting our gross yields, the revenue growth would have been up 15% to 16%",sales,Positive,Confident
So you have to basically influence the fact that you take a whack on your gross yields is not influencing your OpEx,,,
"It just means for affected person within that FEMA designated zone, that account is frozen from migration to the delinquency trends to loss if they're in that affected area",earnings,,
"So if they were in to 150 days past due and they were affected, it would just mean that's going to freeze and that would not have rolled into the charge off after 180 days",,,
"I'd say, Dan, we think the core is still very strong",,Positive,Uncertain
"Occasionally, you get some timing differentials when new programs are coming onboard",,,
I think that's the biggest thing we're looking at,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"It's the traditional bricks-and-mortar or about 85% in store, 15% online",,,

"So that's really the ability for us to capture the data, identify you, track you online and give you a relevant target it off and it gives us the ability to do that",,,
"We'd put it this way, Darrin, is the improvement is not definitive on us onboarding Signet",,,
"I mean, we're looking basically â€“ yes",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"If we're looking to Q4, we would tell you putting Signet on the side line, we feel good gross losses will be down year-over-year in Q4. And that's going to be driven by the natural improvement you're seeing on delinquencies in that wedge",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
We estimate that it's up to 15% of our accounts were within the Florida affected area and the Houston and Texas affected area,,,

"But really, it goes back to something that Ed said before, is with the growth we're generating and now assume that coming onboard, we can look at different verticals and this is one we tested for several years, really, not a great vertical for us",sales,Positive,Confident
It's really time for us to basically do a little bit of cathartic process to the file and get rid of the things that we don't want to focus on,,,
"And so that shift to held-for-sale, that's exactly that small vertical that we're just decided not to pursue",,,

"All of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details",,,
"So I'm not going to walk through them all, but I do want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items and talk about our business outlook for fiscal 2018. Starting with revenue total direct revenue for the fourth quarter increased once again and represented 32% of total revenues",sales,,
That's up from 23% in Q4 last year and just 19% two years ago,,,
That's a lot of progress over a relatively short period of time as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as on our e-store,,Positive,Confident
As we indicated we believe there is still room for our direct business to grow over the next few years as we progress on the model transition,,,
"Moving to spend management, we're really proud of what we've accomplished on the expense side",op_costs,,
We started the year with a goal of keeping non-GAAP spend flat to down 1% we ended up reducing it by 3% for the fiscal year and 4% in the fourth quarter,,,
We accomplish this by making sure we're investing in critical elements of our transition by reducing standard other areas,,,
"Part of the reduction this year was the result of the restructuring we announced at the beginning of the year, coupled with a relentless focus on driving efficiencies across the organization",,,
We significantly reduced our M&A activity this year and we've been simplifying the product portfolio,"products_services,acquisitions",,
We remain committed to keeping spend flat through fiscal 2019 and believe that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company,,,
"During this stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue",sales,,
Total deferred revenue grew 18% against the tough compare last year when we attached very high percentage of maintenance contracts along with the last sale of perpetual licenses for individual products,"sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
"As I mentioned in December, the work we've been doing over the past several quarters on our operating structure has allowed us to move about $1.7 billion of our offshore cash into foreign subsidiaries that are branches of Autodesk U.S",,,
If we look at our cash balance at quarter end approximately 85% can be used without incremental U.S,,,
tax that equates to $1.9 billion,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Of course we need to keep some of our cash for operating needs but we intend to put the majority of it into our stock buyback program and execute on that over the next several quarters using both programmatic and opportunistic means,,,
We've been increasing our buyback this year and in Q4 we repurchased 2.9 million shares,,,
For the year we repurchased nearly10 million shares resulting in a reduction of over 4 million,,,
We're making steady progress on this front and over the past two years of reduced our basic share count by about 3%,,,

Here our primary financial goals were resetting for fiscal 2018. We're projecting the total ARR growth will increase to between 24% and 26%,sales,Positive,Confident
"Subscription additions are projected to increase by 600,000 to 650,000, which equates to about a 20% increase",,,
"Bear in mind, that the sales team focus that goes into the maintenance to subscription program Andrew discussed earlier will drive higher lifetime values from those who convert, but will not drive any additional subscription adds",sales,,
"Spending will be about flat and we expect the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90% beginning in Q1. As we look at our outlook for Q1, keep in mind that total ARR growth and subscription additions will build over the course of the year",sales,Positive,Confident
Another item that I mentioned in December is that we are working to further improve the transparency of our revenue reporting,sales,,
"As such starting in the first quarter, we are planning to have three revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance, and one for other revenue",sales,,
"In this format, all new model subscription revenue will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be reported in the maintenance line, any remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as other revenue",sales,,
"To alleviate the need for the recon table, we've been including in prepared remarks and should significantly improve the link between our financials and our business model transition",,,
"In this format, subscription revenue times four will equal new model AAR, maintenance revenue times four will equal maintenance ARR, and you'll be able to better isolate the non-recurring revenues that flow into the other revenue lines",sales,,
One side effect of this change to call out is that a changes the impact to our ARR calculation to include a couple of small legacy products,products_services,,
"We apply this methodology to our fiscal 2017 results, our total ARR would have been about $40 million higher",,,
"We have factored this change into our guidance assumptions for fiscal 2018, so that we are comparing apples-to-apples",,,
And we will give you visibility to all of fiscal 2017 with the small tweak,,,
"To wrap things up, we've executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on the success as we head into fiscal 2018 and the next stage of our transition",,,
I want to thank our employees and partners who have worked so hard to make last year a success,,,
"I also want to recognize Carl Bass for his leadership and tireless service to Autodesk over the past 20 plus years, and we look forward to his continued input as the special advisor over the next few months and an ongoing board member",products_services,,

"In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's â€“ we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Yes, Sterling said another way",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The price for maintenance after the 5% uplift is exact same price they would pay if they converted to subscriptions incentive,,,
So it's from a modeling standpoint for fiscal 2018 at the same whether they convert or not,,,
"Ken, I don't think we can project that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
What we'd say is that the 73K number was as expected,,,

So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So we will get better at tracking every single customer that goes from column A to column B, especially as we do the maintenance and subscription program",,,
But I think there was nothing unusual about this 73K number that we saw,,,Uncertain
"Ken, if you look at the seasonality of where we typically sold licenses, which is when the maintenance agreements will expire, right",,,
Itâ€™s an annual maintenance agreement when you sold the license becomes the same quarter that maintenance comes through,,,
"The two biggest quarters for that are Q4 and Q1. So 73,000 in Q4 as Amar said was really â€“ churn rate was right in line with our expectations, it is a big quarter in Q1 of renewal opportunities",,,

"Kash, we're not providing that level of granularity under new model, but as always happens in Q4. Q4 and Q1 are the biggest quarters for enterprise subscription adds, Q4 because we sell the most EBAâ€™s and then they come on line throughout the quarter",,,
"Q1 is where we typically get the catch up because as you recall of EBAâ€™s, we actually measure the active users because itâ€™s a consumption model that's not a named user model, we haven't measure the active users and that takes 60 days before we can report those",,,
"So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base",products_services,Positive,Uncertain

The client experience remains a priority for us whether it's through investments in our service model, in innovation and the user experience or in our efforts to upgrade clients with the most appropriate strategic based platforms, we believe that we have the right strategy to address these continuously evolving needs and opportunities and we remain pleased with the progress we are making","products_services,organic_expansion",Negative,Dodgy

"With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our second quarter results and an update to our fiscal 2017 outlook",,,
It's a great question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Obviously, there are two factors that are affecting the growth in our new business bookings",sales,Positive,Confident
"One was the known factor which is the difficult grow-over and obviously, we had some sense of that and factored it in in terms of our guidance for the year because we were obviously below our long-term 8% to 10% as a result of what we knew was going to be a more limited base to sell into since we had already sold half of our clients on ACA",,,
"So that was a known factor, but the reality is we didn't know exactly how much difficulty we would have in selling additional modules of ACA over what we sold last year",,,
So that is a factor that obviously has become more difficult to measure given the talk of the administration of repeal and replace of ACA,,,
"So I guess, in a nutshell, whatever we assumed about the difficult grow-over, I think, it became a much more difficult grow-over as we think many companies in the midmarket and upmarket are probably â€“ have a wait-and-see attitude in terms of what's going to happen around the Affordable Care Act",,,Uncertain
"I think that there's also this kind of second factor which obviously we have no scientific way of measuring which feels like people are in general just delaying and waiting to see what happens not just with ACA, but with a variety of other things that the administration is talking about",,,Uncertain
"Having said all that, there are also a lot of positive things and we see that reflected in some of the public markets or the equity markets in terms of anticipation of lower tax rates and fiscal stimulus and so forth",,,
"And in particular, one of the things that I noted, I've seen a chart that shows â€“ I believe it's the NFIB confidence index, but small business confidence indexes are kind of off the charts positive and in a strange way, it's a little bit reflective of kind of what we're experiencing which is continued success which we don't give guidance by segment, but we have very good and strong new business bookings results in our down market and not so much in our mid and upmarket",,Positive,Confident
"And of course, the PEO, we generally consider to be a down market business but that business does have obviously a relationship to ACA and what's going on around regulation and the variety of regulations that had been talked about previously that now may be subject to change on a go-forward basis",,,
"So there's a lot of moving parts and hopefully that provides you a little bit of color, but we don't have really great precise scientific tool to be able to ascertain how much of the weakness is coming from each factor",,Positive,Confident
"I mean, the most obvious one is this the discussion around the Affordable Care Act, so we â€“ as I mentioned in my prepared comments, ADP generally does well when there's change, but not when there's uncertainty about change",,,
And so I think a protracted debate about what replacement means or what will be happening is probably not helpful to us in terms of our new business bookings results,,,Uncertain
"There are a number of other items out there around, for example, overtime rules, EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] reporting around pay equity and even DOL rules around the fiduciary responsibility that affects our retirement services business",products_services,,
"So there's a number of things that are in play by the administration, generally speaking over 67 years we have benefited from whether it's one particular party or another particular party or one philosophy versus another philosophy because generally there's change, there's constant change and I think, employers use services like ours to help them manage through that change",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"So we, on a medium to long-term basis, are, I think, optimistic that whatever form comes of healthcare reform whether it's more state based or just a different way of providing because I think the administration appears to be committed to maintaining the number of people that have insurance so that will require some form of tracking and some form of enforcement or tax credits and it maybe more state based, but that's something that we hope to be able to help our clients navigate through when the administration and Congress, I think, get further along in terms of figuring out what exactly they want to do",,,Uncertain
"And there's a number of other regulations that are probably less public and less significant on an individual new business bookings basis, but they all add up to quite a lot of bit of potential change which I think would be very good for ADP",,,Uncertain
"As you can see from our retention notes, we haven't add â€“ I think, Jan makes a great point which is what's fascinating is obviously the challenge for us right now is the new business bookings, but we haven't had cancellations or in fact we have clients that are still being implemented on ACA, but it's natural that once you've made a decision and you're committed and you're on the path and it is the law, by the way, it still is the law, it makes sense to go forward, but I can see how some people, if they're doing it in-house or doing it themselves might be hesitant to make a decision given the uncertainty around what's actually going to happen regarding the law",,Positive,Uncertain
"Well, I didn't say the new business bookings growth was weak in the PEO, we don't give segment reporting with details of our bookings",sales,Positive,Confident
"I was just trying to give you a general flavor because, as you saw, we also had some weakness on the revenue growth, but that wasn't necessarily related to ACA, but just in general, I was trying to convey that there is some logical, I guess, explanation to some of what's happening in the sense that there appears to be a lot of optimism on the part of small businesses and we're seeing that reflected in parts of our business",sales,Negative,Uncertain
"In other parts of the business the results are mixed because we do, I think, see as a result of the fact that 50% of the PEO's business comes from referrals of our existing payroll sales force, to the extent that that sales force is encountering some slower decision-making, particularly in the midmarket, and also encountering some slow decision-making as a result of uncertainty about ACA that is expected to have and is having some impact on the PEO",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"But to be clear, the weakness in the revenue growth of the PEO was almost exclusively the pass-through revenues and lower inflation in health benefits and a slight slowing in benefits participation which is probably also related to a, quote unquote, peaking of ACA implementations",sales,Positive,Confident
"And by that I mean that we have seen several year decline in benefits participation rate, in other words how many eligible employees of the PEO actually take benefits and that sort of the trend upward as we got closer to the deadline",,,
"So the last, call it, two years right before ACA, given the fact that the law was intended to increase participation and companies were coming to the PEO in order to comply with the law, we saw those participation rates trend up",,,
And now we saw the increase in the second quarter be a smaller increase than in the prior second quarter and in the quarters before that,,,
"So that slowing trend of benefits participation coupled with lower inflation of benefits per worksite employee is what led to slower growth, if you will, in the PEO, but the 12% worksite employee growth is still very, very strong, so we're still very happy with what we consider to be net revenue growth in the PEO which is now growing almost in line with worksite employees whereas historically had grown a little bit faster because of this pass-through cost pressure","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
So I hope that helps a little bit,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And it's certainly isn't for lack of head count, so we're in a strong position from a sales force capability standpoint",sales,Positive,Confident
"And I think if your question was really around did our retention â€“ I think, you started off by asking about retention, did retention benefit from slower decision, that's possible",,,Uncertain
"So it is possible that on the other side of the coin, if you will, people didn't make as many decisions than we were able to hold on to clients, it'd have very difficult for us to measure that, but it's possible",,,
"I think we also have â€“ I think our expectation is a little bit of a return of the growth of the PEO pass-through cost, which I think that just mathematically also adds to â€“ I think the last part of your question was a broad PEO margin pressure question about ADP, but in this first half, second half it is a factor","sales,earnings,op_costs",Neutral,Uncertain
"Based on our current forecast, just the expectation for our pass-through cost for the second half alone causes some pressure in the second half",op_costs,,
"And I think your broader question about overall pressure is a very, very good question which we spend a lot of time looking at and talking about",,,Uncertain
"But this year in particular, because of lower benefits inflation costs, we actually, as you could tell from the first half of the year, it actually helped us",op_costs,,
It took some of the pressure that we had historically had off,,,
"So even though the PEO has an absolute lower margin, the fact that its margin has been improving as much as it has combined with the slower growth of pass-through costs made this a moot point for the first two quarters of this year","sales,earnings,op_costs",Positive,Confident
And I think what you have from us is a commitment to really make sure that we have a lot of transparency around because we do a lot of what-if scenarios around the next two to three years what the PEO margin expectation is versus the ES margin expectation and the overall ADP,"sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain

So those kind of factors are what helped boost the margins in the first two quarters of the fiscal year which we don't get in the second two quarters of the fiscal year,"sales,earnings",,

Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think that's true,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But, David, you're mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward",sales,Positive,Confident
"Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report",sales,,
"So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get","op_costs,products_services",,
"In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket",,,
"But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients",sales,,
"So the change â€“ if a client buys more, I don't have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform",,,Uncertain
And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected,sales,,
But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total,,,
"And I think that it is â€“ as I think we've been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it's very hard because we're obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new",,,Uncertain
"And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera",,,
"And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong,,Positive,Confident
We were happy with it and we take it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's good for our shareholders,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's good for our revenues,sales,Positive,Confident
But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can't quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that's creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings",,,Uncertain
We just can't put our finger on exactly to what extent,,,
"So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base",,,
But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year,sales,,
"And even though we've gotten some, it's significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA",,,
And so I think that's a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process,,,Uncertain
We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue,,,
Now we have what I would call the political issue,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you're onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we've seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated",,,Uncertain
"And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA",,,Uncertain
"And by the way, some of that happened to us",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA",,,Uncertain
So I think all three things are a factor,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable,,,

And it's driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically â€“ not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year",,,
So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time,sales,Positive,Confident

"a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance",,,
"But we'll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we're bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Uncertain
So we're preparing for growth in the future,sales,Positive,Confident
"And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not",,Neutral,Uncertain
And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down,,,
"So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it's rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not",,,Uncertain
"So it's a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn't changed",,,
"Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half â€“ still a little bit of grow-over but not that material",,,
So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over,,,
"Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times",,,
With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module,sales,,
"So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict",sales,,
"And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients",,,
And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket,,,
And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket,sales,Positive,Confident
"So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales",sales,Positive,Uncertain
"And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP",sales,Negative,NIL

But it's $5 million to $10 million,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's not a big deal on the 'overall gross and net price increase that we passed through to our clients,,,
So â€“ but there's no change in pricing in terms of new business or the competitive environment or anything to that effect,,,
I think it's really related to the factors that we're seeing that Jan was talking about in terms of some of the revenue growth issues,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
The good news for us is that the scale really starts to pick up again for us in the second half,,,
"So if you look at the way this issue has worked with the grow over, part of the confusion might be related to the fact that our fiscal year is in the middle of â€“ obviously, ends in the middle of the year, and the impacts are really calendar-year impacts",,,
"And so, if you go back and you look at quarterly numbers, you will see that we had two strong quarters the first half of this fiscal year, and then now we just had two relatively weak quarters because of the grow over issues",,Positive,Confident
"So we will have another two-week quarters because of the grow over issue at the beginning of fiscal 2018, and then our plans are that our sales return to near pre-ACA levels in the second half, as well as our revenue growth begins to once again gradually accelerate",sales,Positive,Confident
"Now, of course, that means that we have to hit our plans in retention and new business bookings, but that's the way math does work",,,
"Everything we've been telling you, I think, is accurate about the impacts of the grow over of this ACA issue, which were significant",,,Uncertain
"We've mentioned that the business itself is about $175 million in revenue, which means that we sold about $175 million",sales,,
"And so that affected our new business bookings, which is what's causing the grow over from new business bookings",,,
"And likewise, the $175 million in revenue, even though it didn't come all in one year, a lot of it did come in January of 2016, which means that from a revenue standpoint, you also have, call it, a point or so of incremental growth that you've picked up from ACA",sales,Positive,Confident
"And then, obviously, now, from a comparison standpoint, you lose a point",,,
"And that's right about how the math works because on an organic basis, we're at about 7% growth this year, and we were at about 8% last year","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"And so our hope is that once we get past the next couple of quarters, that we get back here to business as usual",,,
"I think our strength in particular â€“ and we think we've talked about this for several years, is really our multinational solutions really do appear to be highly differentiated",,,Uncertain
"And again, multinationals is both very, very large companies with very large populations of employees, but we also have multinational solutions for a company that may be headquartered somewhere in Europe and has 20 employees in four countries in Europe",,,
"So we really go all the way from very, very large Fortune 100 â€“ or world Fortune 100 companies all the way to what I would call local multinationals, if you will, or regional multinationals",,,
And so it's a highly differentiated product,products_services,,
"We've had good sales growth over multiple years, double-digit revenue growth, generating great margins because now we've got scale, and the business is â€“ I would just call it humming along","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Our international business, I think, has gotten better on, what I would call, a relative basis, because it's been a difficult backdrop in Europe, which is our largest international business",,,Uncertain
"We also have a business in APAC and Latin America, but our largest concentration other than Canada in North America is in Europe",,,
"And so that European business on a relative basis, slight improvement in the underlying pays per control",,,
It looks like GDP is starting to pick up a little bit there,,,
"sales, a little bit better this year than we have for the last several years, but I wouldn't say that that business is at the same performance level as the multinational business",sales,,
"We hope it will be at some point in the near future, but the international business, good, solid performance and really good margin performance as well where that business â€“ 10, 15 years ago, my predecessor, we struggled for years to really get that business to perform as well as the rest of ADP from a margin and ""retention standpoint,"" and I think we're kind of there now","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
So we've got good leadership and I think the business is performing very well,,,Uncertain
We're very happy with our international and multinational business,,Positive,Confident
Multinational â€“ sorry,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think in total is about $500 million, Jan? Is that",,,Uncertain

We are on track on the migrations,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think we did about a couple thousand this quarter, probably 2,500 to 3,000 the previous quarter to that",,,Uncertain
"So we're kind of in the same general ballpark, which just as a reminder is much lower than it was at its peak when we were in the middle of ACA, because we had a lot of accelerated migrations in order to get clients on the right platforms to be able to do ACA compliance for them",,,
"And then with the benefit of hindsight, that was an issue for us that caused some of our retention challenges",,,
But fortunately that's all behind us now,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And now we're back to what we were doing all along for several years, which is migrating clients at the right pace, with the right attention and the right what we call now white-glove service",products_services,,
"We have I think it's 5,000 to 6,000 clients left in the midmarket? I'm checking for",,,Uncertain
"About 5,000 to 6,000 clients left",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so you can see that at the pace that we're on now, we have a shot at getting it done by yearend",,,
"We might have, whatever, 500 clients, 1,000 clients left at yearend, that doesn't obviously concern me because we would have done, I think, 60,000 clients",,,Uncertain
"So if we have to â€“ and again, the way our business works is everything has to stop in the middle of November because of yearend",,,
And everything starts again in February,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In other words, the company just becomes focused on getting through the yearend process",,,
"So it could be that we have 500 to 1,000. But it's obviously helping us on a number of fronts because our retention on our strategic platform is much higher than our legacy platform",,,
"So as the number of clients gets smaller and smaller, we get a mathematical lift, if you will, just because of the mix issue",sales,,
"So I think it's â€“ I would say that it's probably not something that will be an enormous amount of focus for all of you going forward, but it is an incredible accomplishment",,,Uncertain
"Because I was talking to the person who runs R&D for that organization about a week ago, and he named all the platforms that we had 10 years ago when he first went to that business",,,
"And we're down to one platform here, and we're close â€“ almost across the finish line",,,
"So the power that that business is going to have now, the focus â€“ and to focus on the competition and to focus on execution and NPS scores and retention is going to be, I think, equal to what we've done in the downmarket on RUN, and that gets me excited",competition,Neutral,Uncertain
Sure,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think your math is probably pretty close, directionally close",,,Uncertain
And that's been obviously why we keep focusing so hard on our service experience and our retention rates because obviously every $10 million that we keep is $10 million less for the competition,"products_services,competition",,
So that's why you hear us being so keenly focused on retention over the last several quarters,,,
"In terms of competitive information, we've said before that we really don't have any one competitor who takes more than 10% of our business, if you will",,,
"So there's really not â€“ and that's been consistent for a long, long time",,,
So there is a lot of competition,competition,,
"So we have a lot of competitors, who operate in multiple segment s",,,
The competitors in the downmarket are different from the midmarket,,,
The midmarket is different from the upmarket,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Some of them bleed across some of those segments,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But in general, we have competitors that tend to be more focused on a particular part of the market than us, which are broadly focused",,,
"I think that gives us some advantages, which we leverage in terms of products and service capabilities, et cetera",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"But at the end of the day, we are very large, and we obviously are the target for a lot of competition",competition,,
"In terms of specifics, we do look very deeply on a quarterly basis at win/losses both head-to-head and sales and also in the book",sales,,
"In other words, clients that we lose to a particular competitor and clients we take away from a particular competitor",,,
In addition to looking at the head-to-head competition from a sales standpoint,"sales,competition",,
"And again, this quarter, unfortunately, it's the same story as other quarters, which is there's no discernible pattern other than there were a couple of competitors in particular that we were able to reverse the tide on, which I'm incredibly proud of because as you point out, we have â€“ there's a few of our competitors that aren't even at the size that you mentioned of $300 million",,,
And obviously we are several billion,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So whenever you can take the net balance of trade and improve it, it's a big accomplishment, and it shows competitive strength in the products, and it shows execution ability in the sales force as well as on the implementation and on the service side","sales,products_services",,
"So there's some glimmers of hope in the last couple of quarters that when we put our minds to it, we can push back, and I think that having clients all-in-one platform, having ACA behind us, there's a number of factors that I think that give me confidence that that focus will be even more heightened on a going-forward basis",,,Uncertain
"And that we'll be able to hopefully make that $300 million, $250 million or $200 million and hopefully slow down some of our competitors",,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We would like to try to help there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And I'll be careful and I'll let Jan do the closing here,,,
"Because of the way our business works, it's a recurring revenue business, and events tend to take place at calendar year ends like they did with ACA",sales,,
So the first two quarters of this fiscal year should not look that different from the first two quarters of this fiscal year from a revenue growth standpoint,sales,Positive,Confident
"If our sales forecasts and our retention forecasts hold true, by the second half of this fiscal year, there will be gradual improvement on the revenue growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"Likewise, when you look at margins â€“ now, clearly, as Jan said, we've been 'adjusting' our expense base to a lower revenue","sales,earnings,op_costs",,
"We just didn't want to do it too quickly because we're trying to focus on retention as well, and we mentioned that we're making investments in sales","sales,organic_expansion",,
But there should be some gradual relief of pressure on the margin in the first half of this fiscal year compared to the second half of last fiscal year,"sales,earnings",,
"But even more, 'relief' and improvement in the second half",,,
And I would call it significant improvement and relief in the second half,,,
"And again, that's all mathematical, and it all works that way, and I think that's probably â€“ I said probably more than I should say, and I'll let Jan",,,Uncertain
"And I think in terms of the relative size of the PEO bookings, I don't know that we don't really give that guidance, but I don't think there's anything wrong with giving you a range of the sales dollars for TotalSource are somewhere around â€“ call it 20% to 25% â€“ 20-ish%, if you will, of the total bookings, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit higher than that",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And again, with good growth, obviously that's driving the top line revenue growth",sales,Positive,Confident
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I shouldn't have done that because Jan is right,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"If you look the sales at the gross level including the pass-throughs, they would be probably, almost as much as our total bookings, because other PEOs probably may report their sales or the new business bookings that way",sales,,
"But obviously we, for the sake of comparability and to make sure that it looks like other ADP business as we do exclude the pass-throughs in the way we count it",,,
So I'll add that we had record retention in a couple of other places as well,,,
So the PEO had record retention,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The SBS business in down-market had record retention,,,
We had a couple of other places that had record retention as well,,,
"And I think that in most of those cases, the only thing I can put my finger on is execution because they are good businesses, and there's a good backdrop",,,Uncertain
"But for the benefit of hindsight, that's kind of always been true",,,
And I think the one variable seems to be execution,,,Uncertain
"So if we really deliver great products and great service, the clients stay in all of the segments",products_services,Positive,Confident
"And so the retention in SBS, for example, now in the downmarket is 3 to 4 percentage points, not basis points, higher than it was five or six years ago and higher than â€“ and that much higher than we thought we would ever be able to achieve",,,
"And again, I think it's getting all the clients on one platform so that you make all your investments and you put all your focus and all your R&D on one platform",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
You heard what we were doing with things like Accountant Connect,,,
It's very hard to do those things when you have three or four platforms,,,
"So having everyone on one platform, going after kind of the friction and the things that create bad service experience and just good execution, all those things, I think you put them together, and it's really created a really great story for us that obviously is translating not only into great retention but great retention in these businesses leads to really great margin performance and really good revenue growth","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,Uncertain
"So the visibility that we have is related to the number of salespeople we have and their productivity, what we call annual sales productivity","sales,products_services",,
So we have a lot of data and many years of data around that,,,
And we know that our productivity jumped dramatically when we had ACA sales and obviously came back down when we didn't have that tailwind,"sales,products_services",Negative,NIL
But we have ways of getting at the numbers,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Having said that, we've said multiple times where it's retention or new business bookings, the amount of visibility we have to that is less than things like revenue next quarter because it's a completely different issue in terms of the recurring revenue, nature of the business makes the revenues, and the margins are somewhat predictable","sales,earnings",,
So new business bookings and retention have less visibility,,,
"But we have ways of getting at what we think are the right targets, which I think as you mentioned are much better obviously in the second half",,,Uncertain
"So again, all things being equal, if the economy cooperates and we continue to execute well and the math holds up historically for ADP, we should be able to get to those numbers",,,
"And obviously, it doesn't happen in a vacuum",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
You've got to have great products,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
You've got to keep sales force turnover down,sales,Negative,NIL
"Those are kind of the controllables that we focus on that, I think we're doing frankly an exceptional job on right now",,,Uncertain
"As you are a very correct observer, Jim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So as an exception in fiscal year 2017, we guided for incremental share buybacks, because we wanted to make â€“ be clear that our intent was to return the proceeds of our debt offering in 2016, which has been completed",debt,,
"So we're now returning to our normal practice, which is we are anticipating to offset equity based dilution for our employer compensation, which is about $400 million or so",,,
And then we should expect â€“ we're aiming to be back at our long-term model that we have shared,,,
And I think the long-term model includes â€“ not that we guide to it â€“ but the long-term model anticipates the return of excess cash to our shareholders of approximately 1% â€“ resulting into approximately 1% of share count reduction,,,Uncertain
"That will be our long-term model and pending on market conditions, obviously",,,
I think it's really too early to read anything into the fourth quarter sales results,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Because as Jan just said, we put in incentives to try to get people over the finish line",,,
"We frankly also implored the sales force to ""not give up,"" because we don't want to send the wrong signal to the market or to our competitors",sales,,
And so there's a lot of moving parts here that I think may have contributed,,,Uncertain
"But it was better than the alternative, so we're happy that we had the finish that we had",,Positive,Confident
"But I don't think that there's really anything you can scientifically read into it, other than maybe underneath the surface there's some better environment in terms of the â€“ because some of the uncertainty â€“ I mean, at some point people have to get back to business as usual despite what's going on in Washington with regulation and with ACA and so forth",,,Uncertain
So maybe there's a little bit of that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But we â€“ can't put my finger on it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"I think with the right economic backdrop, I think should give me â€“ and it does â€“ a high level of confidence and optimism",,,Uncertain

And we're happy to hear about it or address it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But we're not aware of anything other than they're trying to reduce the corporate tax rate,,,
"And obviously there are some, I guess, preferences and benefits that are going to be taken away in order to do that, but those generally apply to, like, the energy sector, manufacturing sector and other",,,
That's why we have a higher effective tax rate,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So in theory there are going to be winners and losers,,,
The people with very low effective tax rate are going to probably get an increase in their effective tax rate,,,
And the people who have a high effective tax rate are going to see a decrease because the statutory corporate tax rate is going to â€“ not going to â€“ they're saying they're going to take it down,,,
"So whether it's 25% or 20% or 30%, that can only help us",,,
And we don't have any significant tax preferences that we take advantage of that would go the other way,,,
"From a client standpoint, we do have a tax credit business",,,
It's relatively small,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We haven't heard any talk about â€“ those are targeted job credit-type taxes that are â€“ tax breaks that are very popular,,,

It could be significantly positive,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"We still think that we'll be close to done, if not done, by the end of the calendar year",,,Uncertain
We may have a couple of stragglers,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But we do expect to be substantially done by the end of the year and that does put pressure on our retention because as we've mentioned multiple times, and the same still holds true, there's quite a substantial difference in retention between our strategic platform in mid-market and our legacy platform",,,
"So, what you're alluding to, we hope and we expect will happen a couple quarters from now as we get all these migrations and the mid-market behind us",,,
But that would not be one of the reasons why there was improvement in the mid-market as well as in the rest of ES this quarter,,,
I think the impact of that large loss was around 100 basis points last year,earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, the right way to look at this is about 60 basis point improvement in retention for the quarter",,,
Other than that it's getting really big,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And we're still pretty happy with 10% unit growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"I don't think anything further to report there, but that's becoming a very large, we're close the 0.5 million worksite employees",,,Uncertain
That's one of the largest employers in the U.S,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

We are a co-employer and consider ourselves a co-employer for the purposes of some of the responsibilities around employment,,,
"And so technically, I think we're probably in the top five now in terms of size of employers in the U.S",,,Uncertain
which is becoming a very large base,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But we feel pretty happy and pretty satisfied with that kind of growth rate,sales,Positive,Confident
"So just to make sure we get our language clear here, because we have introduced some new terminologies",,,
"So, when we refer to next-gen platforms, so we have our strategic platforms, which are Workforce Now, RUN, Vantage and our Global View multinationals platform",,,
We did start talking and we mentioned it in our introductory comments that we talked to industry analysts in mid-September about our next-generation platforms which we have only a handful of clients on today,,,
"So, I just want to make sure I clarified the language there",,,
"As we go forward, we'll be more careful about making sure that we pick the right language",,,
"So, and I'm sorry, what was the rest of the question?",,,
"So since we still have a lot of work to do in the up-market where we've really only begun the migrations, I think that's consistent with what we've said before in our publicly released information around the proxy contest",,,Uncertain
I think we included there about 51% of our revenues being on our strategic platforms that I just mentioned the names of,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"It's very important to note that when we talk about our strategic platforms, we have a number of areas of our business where there's really no immediate plan to migrate or move clients",,,
"So for example, our insurance services, our retirement services, we have some international platforms that we're happy with that we're not planning any movement there",products_services,Positive,Confident
"So, we could probably in the future be able to provide some more color around the quote-unquote addressable market",,,
"In other words, what part of our client base is really up for migration, if you will, but the right answer, the straight answer is 51%",,,
"But we're not aiming to get to 100%, I guess is the",,,
"We disclose a lot of information, again as we've been trying to communicate with shareholders about some of the things we've been doing here over the last five or six years",,,
"We've disclosed, I think, some additional information about that",,,Uncertain
"And I think starting off with the fact that we've increased our innovation spend from around $150 million to around $450 million, I think or somewhere thereabouts in that neighborhood, so it's a significant amount of increase in our R&D investment",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
A large part of that was in the next generation platforms that we just announced recently that we've been working on here in some cases for three to four years,,,
"But we've also made big investments in things like our data cloud and things like our mobile solutions and some of the other products and innovations that we actually already have out in the market and are helping us, I think, with our efforts in terms of helping our clients and also helping drive new business bookings and retention and so forth","products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"So, that's a sense of what's happened with the innovation spend",,,
"On the maintenance spend, for the sake of I guess government work, it's about flat",,,
So it's increased slightly,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But again, in the world of some inflation, the fact that we've held that constant, we see that as a good news story",,,
"It was a conscious effort to really shift the mix, if you will, in the balance of our spending to more innovation and less maintenance",,,
"A lot of our maintenance spend is focused on platforms that serve tens of millions of employees that get paid, both on our tax engine and our payroll engine",,,
"And so as we develop these next generation technologies, when we retire those legacy platforms, which is a ways down the road, then obviously, we would expect actual decreases in maintenance spend",,,
"But for the last several years, this has really been a story of increasing the spend and making sure that that spend is focused on innovation while we build out the necessary platforms to move clients to and then reduce the spending on those legacy platforms",,,
We have retired I think it's around 13 legacy platforms,,,Uncertain
"So, it's the first time in a long time at ADP that we've actually retired things",,,
"So, it's not like we haven't made any progress, but those were relatively small dollar items in terms of the overall maintenance spend",,,
"The really big chunks of spend are on some of our large scaled legacy platforms that service, by the way, very well and are very efficient, very secure and very reliable",products_services,,
And we have no plans to get off of them in the next three to six months or any kind of timeframe like that,,,
"So this is a, as we always say, this is an evolutionary process, not an overnight change",,,
"So, I'm going to let Jan maybe go through a few of the numbers here",,Neutral,Uncertain
But just quickly on the hurricanes and Jan will give you a sense of impact,,,
"Clearly, it had an impact on the business",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But I just want to take a moment to also point out that these were massive storms, especially in Houston and in Puerto Rico",,,
We have a decent sized business in Puerto Rico,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We obviously have a very large presence in Texas and in Houston specifically,,,
"And what our associates and our infrastructure people did to be able to continue our business, not necessarily as usual, but to make sure the business went forward and that we served our clients was nothing short of heroic, including flying airplanes from Tampa when no other planes were flying into Puerto Rico to deliver supplies to our associates but also to deliver payrolls to the businesses that were actually still functioning and still wanting to pay their people so that they would be able to actually have money for, in obviously what was an incredible crisis",,,
"So, the fact that you're asking the question, I think shows the strength of ADP that we continued to perform and to deliver business as usual in the face of what was obviously a very, very challenging situation",,Negative,Uncertain
I think Jan maybe has a little bit of color on the numbers,,,Uncertain
"And just to point out, there have been times in our history in the PEO where it's been even higher than this",,,
"So as Jan said, it really depends on the general health care inflation environment",,,
"It's clearly not sustainable from a â€“ it's not just about our PEO or our own company, but this is why there was healthcare reform to begin with, that you can't have this kind of healthcare inflation for a long period of time, because it just doesn't work from an economy standpoint",,,
It becomes the entire GDP eventually,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, it's safe to say that this is a number that has to, by definition, maybe not over a quarter or two or over one year, but that number has to at some point converge or regress back to the mean",,Neutral,Uncertain
But we have had times where we've had even bigger differential between worksite employee growth and our pass-through revenue growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"And this is probably from a three or four year standpoint, this is probably the highest it's been and it's probably in line with what you're hearing out in the world, right",,,
Which is healthcare inflation's picking up a little bit,,,
"We'll try to help with that, but again, what we encourage people to do is to look at Employer Services margins and profit growth and the PEO's margins and profit growth","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
Because what we're focused on is growing EPS and creating value for our shareholders,,,
We're not fixated on a specific margin number even though we realize that the margin number is important to the overall economic model and to actually building a model that works,"sales,earnings",,
Right,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Exactly, I mean that's ultimately the â€“ growth in Employer Services and profitability Employer Services and growth in PEO ultimately would drive return on invested capital and that's really the right way to focus on the business","earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"As you know, our PEO business is our most profitable, most successful, best business",earnings,Positive,Confident
"So, for us to get overly concerned about mix and what impact that has on the overall margin, I realize it's something we have to address and we have to talk about and help people with their models, but it's really not the right way to focus on the business","sales,earnings",,
"One last thing, because you did mention about the distraction on the â€“ I just wanted to answer that question because others may have the same question",,,
"I think the way I have been, had a lot of investors asking is the same thing, because there's a lot of concern about the distraction of the proxy contest and I would say that it's an extremely high distraction for an extremely small group of people",,,Uncertain
"As you can see from the results of this quarter, it did not distract our associates or our sales force",sales,,
"I think it's probably, it's both",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think we had, we obviously feel better about what's going on with retention and I think the trends in the business",,,Uncertain
"We got a little bit of help from, even from float income as you mentioned because that actually flows into our top line as well as into our bottom line","sales,earnings",,
But I think you're correct that that just happens to be the way the numbers have fall out as well,,,Uncertain
So I think it's both things,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think that one of the things we've been as we've been kind of going out talking to folks, making sure that this is an opportunity now to make sure everyone understands that the starting point for margins in terms of the amount of room there is for improvement was larger in the small business market than it is in the mid-market","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
So we have a successful good business in the mid-market including healthy margins,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"We do think that based on what we see around retention potential because the real, one of the really important improvement to the small business division was the rise in retention which has a fairly big impact in that business on margins because the amount of business you have to sell, which brings with it sales cost, implementation cost, is less to achieve the same growth objective if you will","sales,earnings,op_costs",Positive,Uncertain
"And so that was an important part of that picture, if you will, in small business, the improvement in retention",,,
"I am hopeful, based on what we're seeing so far, that we are going to experience good improvements in retention in our mid-market as well once we're through migrations all of our clients on one platform",,,
"Better retention should have the same impact that it had on SBS in the sense that you have sell that much less business in order to achieve the same growth rate or you can grow faster, like it's either you get the best of both worlds that you can choose which way depending on market conditions you want to move",sales,Positive,Confident
But the absolute starting point is important as it is always in any situation,,,
"And again, we don't give specifics sub segment data if you will",,,
"Neither do any of our competitors, I would just point out",,,
But the fact is the margins are higher,"sales,earnings",,
"They were higher to begin with in mid-market and the replatforming is really about strengthening our competitive position, driving faster growth and hopefully some modest improvement in margins as well because we do expect to get higher retention rates in the mid to long term as we get all of our clients onto one platform","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Yeah, and think I also want to point out again, I want to say it one more time that clearly some of the pressure we're experiencing is from investments, because we have been investing in our sales force for example","sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
But it's just important to note that some of what's happening in terms of these numbers is still these mathematical grow-overs and comparisons,,,
"Because last year, in the first half of the fiscal year, so the last two quarters of the calendar year, we had almost 20% operating income growth, and then in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, first two quarters of the calendar year, because of the ACA grow-over in the comparisons of having lapped the revenues, the revenue comparison, we ended up having the numbers go in the opposite direction",sales,Positive,Uncertain
"And the two quarters that we're in right now, the quarter that we're just reporting plus the next quarter, are really mirror images of the first two quarters of the calendar year",,,
"And then as we've said multiple times in our guidance, our second half of this fiscal year gets back from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint, from a bookings standpoint to a more reasonable normalized place, if you will","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"So unfortunately the way â€“ you guys know this better than anyone else â€“ like whenever, whether it's an acquisition or ACA or some other factor, you have to really look beyond that to understand what's really happening beneath the covers",acquisitions,,
"And so we had 12 months of easy comparisons, and then we had 12 months of hard comparisons",,,
"And we have, I guess right now, a couple more months before we get through those difficult comparisons",,,
"Well we hope, we do for example invite clients on a regular basis to visit our Innovation Center in New York City in Chelsea to kind of get first hand knowledge of some of the things that we're working on",,,
And it's not just about the platform,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We have other things that we are working on as well that we share with our clients,,,
"So obviously, part of that is an effort to make sure the clients understand our roadmap and so that they stick with us as we get through product development and then eventually a transition to our New York platforms",products_services,,
"I think that would be true in each of our business segments, but it's obviously very important in the up-market enterprise space where the client lifecycles are very, very long",,,Uncertain
So we have very high retention rates in our up-market business,,,
Client stay 15 to 20 years on average,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And obviously if they are staying with ADP for that long, that means they've already been through multiple changes in technology with ADP over the years",,,
"So this is just another evolution if you will, which makes the products better for them, easier to use, easier to service, easier to upgrade",products_services,,
"So these are all, I think, part of leveraging technology, which is one of the central themes that we've had here for the last five or six years",,,Uncertain
"So we're really trying to do what ADP's been doing for many years with a slight change in emphasis, with greater emphasis on product and technology than maybe historically we had had 5, 10, 15 years ago",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"So the second part is a tricky question, because the way it gets shared, if you will, is it makes our company stronger",,Positive,Confident
"It allows us to, for example, theoretically, to be more careful with price increases",,,
"None of which â€“ so I guess the answer is, we haven't changed anything",,,
"Like it hasn't â€“ if rates were as you know because of the way our portfolio is laddered, even though we felt multiple years of pressure on the downside, we are getting a little bit of help here on the upside",,,
"But there's really, this isn't like an overnight, and I don't mean overnight in the sense of rates",,,
"But because of the laddering, there's not that kind of dramatic of a change that we are all of sudden that it's raining money out of the helicopters and we have to figure out what to do with it",,,
But we definitely appreciate it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's better than it was when it was going in the other direction,,,
So it's all positive,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So I think historically, I think it probably make us stronger, more competitive",,Positive,Uncertain
But we really don't â€“ there's no pricing mechanism,,,
"We didn't raise prices, when interest float income went down and rates went down",,,
And we don't plan on lowering prices when it goes up,,,
I guess to be completely direct,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And, Jan, just to add, just to be even more clear, we lost $300 million in float income and that's assuming that the balances have stayed flat, but the balances actually grew from about $15 billion to over $20 billion during that period of time",,,
And I am thinking back to like 2007 and 2008 when we peaked in terms of our float income,,,Uncertain
And so there's a long way to go to get back to that $300 million and that would not be even adjusting for inflation and for growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"And as Jan just said, we don't have those kinds of arrangements",,,
We didn't increase our prices when that was going on,,,
So we managed to improve our margins and grow our business in the face of that kind of headwind,"sales,earnings",,
And so I think it feels fair to us to now enjoy the fruits of a better environment on a go-forward basis would be the way we would look at it,,,Uncertain
We never said there's a new version to an up-market product,products_services,,
And so you shouldn't say it either,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So what we built was, we built a platform on which we can build apps that could serve a number of different clients",,,
It could be used globally,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It could be used in the up-market and frankly someday, can be used in the mid-market",,,
So we're not ready,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We shared a lot of information with industry analysts and we're trying to share as much information with all of you without sharing so much information that it creates a competitive problem for us,,,
And so we're not ready to say exactly what we're doing and where we're going,,,
"But I can tell you that the benefits are obviously usability, speed to change and speed to development, cost of maintenance, not to mention cost of development",op_costs,,
So there are a number of benefits that we will get from our product development efforts,products_services,,
And that's really only talking about the low code development platform,,,
We also have two very large investments in back-office systems,organic_expansion,,
So this is our gross-to-net payroll engine and our tax engine as well,,,
There we expect and the plan is to have that be completely transparent,,,
These engines are back-office engines that are really not visible to the clients,,,
"They just, they create outcomes",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The front ends are Workforce Now, Vantage, and some of our other front-end products",products_services,,
"And so there's really no expected impact assuming that we execute well in the kind of transition, if you will, to a new gross-to-net payroll and also tax engine",,,
"The expectation for improvements, though, are fairly significant in the sense that we'll have a lot more flexibility around the things we can do around payments",,,
"So we may choose to, we may not necessarily do it, but we'll have the ability to do same-day payments, real-time payments",,,
"We'll have a lot more flexibility around speed to make changes, whether they're statutory or competitive changes in our systems",,,
And then the cost of maintenance and the cost of support will go down significantly based on our business cases that we have for these back-office engines,op_costs,Negative,NIL
"So these are really modernization efforts because those platforms serve us incredibly well today at high scale, high reliability and high security",,,
"But we believe based on our business cases that obviously, whether it's two, five, seven years down the road, that new technology can help us leverage those services that we provide in a much more efficient manner",products_services,Negative,NIL
Well the impact of the acquisition would be zero because it's zero,acquisitions,,
It's a great business and it's a good-sized revenue business fortunately it's around breakeven is the way we would describe it,sales,Positive,Confident
So it's not a huge drag on our earnings and it's not a huge help,earnings,,
"It has a small drag on margins obviously because at breakeven, and with some reasonable revenues, it doesn't help our margins","sales,earnings",,
But I would say no impact in terms of EPS guidance from acquisitions,acquisitions,,
"And the other, I'm sorry the second part of your question was?",,,
"I think for bookings growth, what we try to look at is the noise in the system has been pretty significant in the last 24 months because first, we had ACA and then we didn't have ACA",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So I have to preface my comments by saying, it hasn't been exactly business as usual",,,
"But in typical business as usual for ADP, we would have a head count increase, accompanied by a productivity increase of our sales force, which would lead to our sales result","sales,products_services",,
"And so the mechanisms that we would, the buttons that we would push to try to increase or improve our new business bookings would generally be around increasing our head count, or our capacity if you will of sales, because we could also spend money on digital marketing and other tools that make our sales force more efficient",sales,,
"And then what can we do around products to drive the productivity, because some of the productivity is just like in any business, we expect our sales force to do a little bit better each year","sales,products_services",,
But we also try to give them better products and more things to sell so that they can also grow their productivity that way,products_services,,
"So one of the things we did last year is, in the face of the challenges we were having, we decided to actually invest in head count",,,
"We'd had two or three years where we were able, because of the tailwind of the ACA, to put less into head count because we were getting more from productivity",products_services,,
"And we opted last year really to, in order to make sure that we had a good couple of years of new business bookings, we invested in our head count",,,
And we're now I think at about 7% head count growth year-over-year,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
That's pretty healthy for us when you look at the last five or six years,,,
It doesn't have an immediate impact because those people have to become productive,products_services,,
They have to get ramped up,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
They have to get into the field,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But as those people mature, that's an investment that should pay off for us for several years to come as those new sales reps become more mature and become more productive over time","sales,products_services,organic_expansion",,
"So I guess the answer your question is, the reason we feel good about our forecast, which again is subject to interference by, as we just saw the government had a fairly large change in direction nine months ago",,,Uncertain

But I think it's way too early to think about how the first quarter impacts 2020 for us,,,Uncertain

Third quarter 2017 recurring fee revenues rose 30% to $592 million; and total revenues rose 46% to $1.01 billion,sales,,

"Excluding the impact of the Accenture Post Trade Processing or APTP recontracted from a year ago, which I will discuss in my comments on the GTO segment results, internal growth would have been neutral, and organic recurring fee revenue growth was at 5%","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Our year-to-date revenue figures can be found on page 7. Total revenues rose 45% to $2.8 billion with NACC, again, being the largest driver and with event-driven revenues a drag",sales,,
Recurring revenues rose 32% to $1.6 billion,sales,,
"Organic growth contributed 5 percentage points to our recurring fee growth over the first nine months, with the balance coming from acquisitions, mostly, NACC","sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"Turning to slide 8. Adjusted operating income rose 22% to $134 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That growth was driven by the acquisition of NACC, organic recurring fee revenue growth, and the impact of higher event-driven revenues","sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"Adjusted operating income margins declined from 15.9% to 13.2%, largely as a result of adding the lower-margin NACC business, partially offset by the increase in event-driven revenue and higher margins in the GTO segment","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
Adjusted EPS rose 19% to $0.69; and GAAP EPS grew by 21%,,,
There are three items of note that had an impact on EPS,,,
"The first was the $9 million non-cash gain, resulting from the acquisition of Message Automation",acquisitions,,
"Because Broadridge owned a minority interest in that company, the acquisition triggered a revaluation of our investment stake, resulting in a one-time non-cash gain, which was not subject to tax",acquisitions,,
"So, all $9 million fell directly through to our reported GAAP earnings and GAAP EPS",earnings,,
"While the gain benefited our GAAP EPS, it has been excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS",earnings,,
The second item was the tax rate,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Excluding the impact of the Message Automation gain, our tax rate was 31.3% in the third quarter",,,
"As we have in recent fiscal third quarters, we recognized one or more discrete items, which had the effect of lowering our third quarter rate that had only a small impact on the forecasted full-year rate",,,
"We expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 34%, excluding this gain and 33% with the gain",,,
The third item to point out is the share count,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
A 1% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding also contributed modestly to our EPS growth,sales,Negative,NIL
That decline primarily reflects the shares Broadridge repurchased over the past three fiscal quarters,,,
"Moving to slide 9. For the nine-month period, our adjusted operating income grew by 16%; and adjusted EPS rose 12%",,,
"Turning to slide 10, a review of the performance of our ICS and GTO segments",,,
"ICS revenues rose 60% to $826 million in the third quarter, driven largely by the impact of higher recurring fee and distribution revenues from NACC and an increase of event-driven revenues",sales,,
ICS recurring fee revenues rose 48% to $389 million,sales,,
"On an organic basis, revenues rose 6%, driven entirely by Net New Business","sales,organic_expansion",,
"ICS recurring fee revenues benefited from organic growth in our communications business and from growth in data and analytics, tax, and other new product lines","sales,products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"As Rich noted, ICS revenues also benefited from a pickup in ETF and mutual fund interim position growth to 5%, as well as 6% stock record growth",sales,Positive,Confident
ICS earnings before taxes rose 10% to $74 million from $67 million,earnings,,
"The growth in earnings reflects the impact of the NACC acquisition and higher event-driven revenues, which more than offset higher amortization expense related to the NACC and Inveshare technology acquisitions","sales,earnings,op_costs,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"Next, to GTO",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
GTO recurring revenues rose 6% to $203 million,sales,,
"Organic growth was 3%, and recent acquisitions contributed another 3%","sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"Breaking down the organic growth, closed sales added 7 points of revenue growth, which netted to 5 points of Net New Business after client losses","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"The contribution from Net New Business reflects the strong GTO sales results over the last couple of years, including some sales closed in fiscal year 2015. This meaningful lag between sales and revenue recognition highlights the number of larger deals we have been closing",sales,Positive,Confident
These larger deals are typically more complex and have longer conversion times,,,
"Similarly, as we consider the recent record sales results, many of the sales we have closed over the course of this fiscal year will not begin to have an impact on reported revenues until late fiscal 2018, 2019, and in some cases, even 2020. The growth in revenue attributed to Net New Business was offset by negative 2 points of internal growth",sales,Positive,Confident
Our general growth comparison was impacted by the recognition of $4 million of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 related to the recontracting of a single APTP contract,sales,Positive,Confident
"Excluding the impact of that revenue, internal growth would've been modestly positive; and GTO organic growth would've been 5%","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"GTO earnings before taxes rose 10% to $44 million, as we continue to realize positive operating leverage, especially for Net New Business","earnings,debt",Positive,Confident
"Moving on to slide 11. Broadridge's annual free cash flow generation is typically weighted to the second half of the year, and I expect fiscal 2017 to follow the same pattern",,,
Broadridge generated $130 million in free cash flow in the third quarter and $93 million year-to-date,,,
"We continue to expect to achieve our guidance for the full-year free cash flow of $350 million to $400 million, inclusive of unusually high capital expenditures",,,
"At this point, we expect to be in the lower half of that range",,,
Broadridge will continue to balance smart investments in its business with returning capital to shareholders,organic_expansion,,
"During the third quarter, we invested $38 million in capital expenditures and software spend and spent $20 million net of cash to acquire Message Automation, adding to the compliance capabilities of our GTO business",,,
We also want to maintain an efficient and lean capital structure,,,
"So, as our cash flow picked up, we increased our share repurchase activity",,,
"In total, Broadridge repurchased 1.6 million shares for an average price of $69. That brought our quarter-end outstanding share count to 117.1 million",,,
That capital return was in addition to the $40 million return with the quarterly dividend,,,
"Now, let's turn to our fiscal year 2017 guidance, which can be found on slide 12. We are reaffirming our guidance for the full year",,,
We continue to expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 40% to 42%,sales,Positive,Confident
"We now expect our event-driven revenues to be higher in the fourth quarter than they were a year ago, as some of the meaningful mutual fund proxy event-driven activity for calendar year 2017, which we highlighted in our February call, is now likely to occur on fiscal fourth quarter",sales,,
"The increase in event-driven revenue, along with associated distribution revenues, is likely to push our reported fiscal 2017 revenues closer to high end of the projected full-year range",sales,,
"For recurring fee revenues, we were reaffirming our guidance of 29% to 31% growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"With a lower than expected revenue contribution from NACC, we expect recurring fee revenue growth to be closer to the lower end of that range",sales,Positive,Confident
"Excluding the impact of NACC, we expect recurring fee revenues to grow 6% to 7%, including organic growth of approximately 5%","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
We expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the middle of our 12% to 17% range or 13% to 15%,sales,Positive,Confident
There are few factors at play in the fourth quarter to note,,,
"One, we expect ICS, excluding NACC, have a nice finish to the year on recurring fee and earnings growth","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Two, NACC is expected to have a seasonally lighter contribution to the fourth quarter, and therefore, will be less meaningful to the quarter's earnings growth","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"And finally, we expect to incur higher expenses related to efficiency initiatives",op_costs,,
Keeping our costs in check is critical to our overall growth strategy,"sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"And these initiatives will help to position us for additional growth by enabling us to reinvest in our business, while delivering bottom line growth in fiscal 2018 and 2019. Our final key metric is closed sales","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"As Rich noted earlier, we have reported record closed sales, and our pipeline remained strong",sales,Positive,Confident
"As a result, we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our closed sales guidance of $140 million to $180 million",sales,,
One additional housekeeping item with regards to our guidance,,,
We are raising our forecast for segment profit margins for GTO to approximately 21% from approximately 19.5%,"sales,earnings",,
That change reflects the healthy increase in GTO profits for the first nine months and our expectations for broadly similar margin in the fourth quarter,"sales,earnings",,
"So, to sum up, Broadridge reported strong third quarter results, with double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EPS, and closed sales, and remain on track to deliver our fiscal year 2017 guidance on key metrics of recurring fee revenue growth, adjusted EPS, and closed sales",sales,Positive,Confident
"We continue to maintain a balanced approach to capital utilization, investing in our business while taking advantage of the increase with seasonal cash flow to step up repurchase activity",,,
Broadridge remains focused on disciplined expense management,op_costs,,
"We expect spending on efficiency initiatives to increase in the fourth quarter, as we position the business for more growth",sales,Positive,Confident
We look forward to closing out fiscal year 2017 and updating you on our plan for fiscal year 2018 on our August call,,,
"With that, I will now hand the call back to Rich for his closing remarks",,,

And it sounds like you did catch the comment on the lag between sales and revenue recognition,sales,,
"Again, it's a great success",not_applicable,Positive,Confident
We've built up a good set of deals in our revenue backlog,sales,Positive,Confident
"And because it's skewing towards larger deals that Rich mentioned, we'll take a little bit more time to see the revenue flow in",sales,,
"So, there'll be a little bit of delayed gratification",,,

"As Rich said, maybe a bit more intensity and formality around this",,Neutral,Uncertain
But this is kind of a muscle that we exercise pretty regularly,,,
"So, just sort of giving you a heads up that we could see a little bit of elevated expense in the fourth quarter for that, as part of laying our foundation for more growth","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"Thanks, Lip-Bu and good afternoon everyone",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Consistent execution drove excellent financial results for the second quarter, highlighted by revenue near the high end of our guidance range and operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow, all exceeding expectations","sales,earnings",,
"Specifically, here are some key results for the quarter; total revenue of $479 million; non-GAAP operating margin was 27%; GAAP net income per share was $0.25; non-GAAP net income per share was $0.34; and operating cash flow was $162 million","sales,earnings",,
"Also, please note that the recurring revenue mix was approximately 90%; DSOs were 31 days, down six days from Q1 on strong collections",sales,Positive,Confident
Our DSO target remains approximately 35 days,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"For geographies and products, Asia continued as our fastest growing region, with revenue up 18% year-over-year","sales,products_services",,
"As Lip-Bu mentioned, digital and sign-off revenue was up 14% year-over-year, as we benefit from proliferation with market shaping customers and IP continued to rebound from 2016, with revenue up 15%",sales,,
"Functional verification revenue was down from last year, as overall hardware revenue was less than anticipated for the first half",sales,Negative,NIL
"However, we expect hardware revenue to be a little stronger for the second half",sales,Positive,Confident
Now let's turn to our outlook,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We are increasing our revenue and EPS outlook,sales,,

"In January of this year, the board authorized the repurchase of $525 million of our common stock",,,
"We did not repurchase shares in the first half of the year, but we do expect to repurchase some shares in Q3. I also want to provide a few additional comments before we take questions",,,
"As a reminder, hardware and IP have become a larger portion of our business, which may lead to more variability in our results from quarter-to-quarter",,,
Only about 5% of our revenue is in currencies other than the U.S,sales,,
"dollar, primarily the Japanese yen",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But about 30% of our costs are in currencies other than the dollar,op_costs,,
"So weakening dollar would generally be a headwind to operating profits, and conversely, a strengthening dollar would be a tailwind",earnings,,

But just want to point out,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So Jay, this is John, I will take that first question on the cash flow",,,
"I'd just point you to the DSOs, that we had a six day decrease in DSO from Q1. A number of large payments came in after the end of the first quarter, driving a more favorable comparison between the quarters",,,
"So Q2 ended up being a very strong quarter for us, for collections",,Positive,Confident
"But so you will see a little bit more, a shift to the first half for cash collections",,,
"But our guidance reflects our confidence in the business, and takes into account everything we know at this time",,,

Let me now reiterate our guidance for the third quarter,,,
This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier,,,

The guidance for the third quarter is as follows,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We expect revenue in the range of minus 2% to 0% year-over-year,sales,,
We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%,"sales,earnings",,
"The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%","sales,earnings",,
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.59. My guidance does not reflect any impact from AppDynamics,earnings,,
I will now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments,,,
"No, I think just to add to that, I think we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the U.S",,,Uncertain
"certainly, and in commercial and enterprise",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I'd say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, our guide, we always call it like we see it",,,
And it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line,"sales,earnings",,
"So I think â€“ like Chuck said, I think the U.S",,,Uncertain
"is solid, and again we're still cautious on outside the U.S",,,
and Europe and Asia,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"No, yeah, I think what I say is between 1% and 2%, right",,,Uncertain
So we're in that 1.5% to 2% range,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well again, as we continue to accelerate the growth, as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing it, I referred it may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters it has been in that range",sales,Positive,Confident
"Yeah, we don't share gross margins by business unit, but I can tell you, the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions and the SaaS businesses we've been adding","sales,earnings,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
So it's very accretive to the Cisco average,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Hi, Vijay",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"So actually product as a percentage of my total product revenue, it's up to 10% now this quarter for the first time, so we're happy about that","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
And we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business,,,
Cisco ONE is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross enterprise ELAs that really are a core networking business to do that,,,
So we're trying to find ways to find other offers,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'll just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned,,,
"It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we're selling that",,Positive,Confident
We used to sell it always as a system,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Now we're selling the equipment, but we're selling it with a subscription",,,
So that's an example of how we've been able to kind of to drive new offers that had been traditionally just pure system or hardware,,,
"And again, the teams are driving hard to find more ways to accelerate new offers that way",,,
Thank you,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, on the deferred, Mark, I mean that is part of why we're trying to make this shift to software",,,
It's our customers want those offers and to have easier way to run their IT departments,,,
"But it clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure","sales,earnings",,
"And it's not only just the gross margin coming out of deferred revenue, but we're looking at our whole end-to-end operations, and how we go to market, how we drive operations in the back end here","sales,earnings,op_risks",,
And there's real opportunities to drive both gross margins and operating margins,"sales,earnings",,
So that's why we're so focused on it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"That's why we're looking at acquisitions to add to it, and it will continue to help improve our mix on the margins line","sales,earnings,acquisitions",,
"I'll take that one, and a great question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Gross margins, we've been â€“ again continue to operate well","sales,earnings",,
I'll say there were two specific kind of headwinds that we faced this quarter,,,
"And to your point on APJC, I'll refer back to a year ago, we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities",,,
"Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smartcards to go with that, which they're basically for secure access and it was very, very high margin","sales,earnings",,
"So we had, if you go back a year ago, SP video in Asia was extremely strong because of that",,Positive,Confident
That program has dramatically slowed down,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And again, that pure margin just isn't there anymore, and you're seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP video and APJC","sales,earnings",,
"The other item that's a headwind for us this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs, our DRAM memory costs that we're paying",op_costs,,
It's a very tight supply right now and we're seeing dramatic increases there,,,
So that's hurting us quite a bit as well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But other than that, I'd say the color's in the same line",,,
Our pricing is in â€“ it's in the ranges that we've been the last six to eight quarters,,,
"I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4. A little worse in (37:06) last quarter, but we were very low last quarter",,,
So in the normal ranges,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But really it's those two specific things,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP video, that China program, in Q3 as well",,Positive,Confident
I'll start on the supplier component issue,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So yeah, those articles are out there",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We have had an issue from a supplier come out, and we did book a reserve for $125 million, you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release, to cover that",,,
"We always, and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this",,,
This is very proactive,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we're working with our customers to work through that",,,
So we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective,sales,,
"Sure, so yeah",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion and everything's growing in that space,sales,Positive,Confident
"I'd say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that, because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly",,,
And they're all growing huge double digits,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But I will also say my switching, my routing, as well as data center and we've done Cisco ONE bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements",,,
They've also been growing huge double digits as well,,,
"So at the end of the day, the year-over-year increase is across the board",,,
Everything is up massively to drive to that 51%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security and wireless, they are two-thirds I'd say of the balance, but the other pieces are rapidly -",,,
"Yeah, wireless being Meraki, yes",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Hopefully that gives you the color you're looking for,,,
Not as of right now,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Again, we're working very proactively with our customers and in terms of how quickly and where they want to do their replacement",,,
"So we're working very, very closely, but as of right now we have not seen and don't anticipate any massive revenue impact from this",sales,,
"Thank you, Marilyn, and, good afternoon, everyone",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Our results this quarter demonstrate the continued progress we're make on our strategic priorities,,,
"In Q1 we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue",sales,Positive,Confident
"The progress we've made resulted in all three of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1. Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale",sales,Positive,Confident
"Today, the network is becoming more pervasive and critical to business success as billions of new connections are added",,,
"We expect these new connections will become increasingly automated, intelligent and secure, delivering unprecedented insights and intelligence to our customers",,,
"Cisco's vision is to deliver highly secure intuitive technology across our portfolio that is designed to constantly learn, adapt and protect to drive business outcomes with greater speed and agility",,,
"This extends to the network, next generation data center architectures, advanced IoT applications end-to-end analytics and our Collaboration technologies",,,
Our vision is resonating with customers and partners around the world as we help them build more secure intelligent platforms for their digital businesses,,,
"Today, most of our customers are operating in complex, multi-cloud environments and Cisco is well positioned to provide them with networking capabilities, enterprise class security and support together with cloud scale, agility and economics",,,
Our new partnership with Google is a good example of this,,,
"Over the last few months our engineering teams have been working closely together to jointly develop a new hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable applications and services to be deployed, managed and secured across on-premise environments, as well as Google Cloud Platform, bringing the best of cloud to the enterprise",products_services,,
This partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web-scale providers,,,
We're also investing to develop and acquire new technologies to extend our Multicloud Portfolio,,,
"This includes ACI anywhere, which we announced this quarter and acquisitions such as CliQr, OpenDNS, Cloudlock, AppDynamics and Viptela",acquisitions,,
Now I'd like to cover some key business highlights in our new product reporting categories,products_services,,
"First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Our launch of The Network,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Intuitive,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
in June is an example of the investment and innovation we're driving in our core business,organic_expansion,,
"These new intent-based networking capabilities are providing customers' unparalleled insights and intelligence, together with highly-differentiated security and programmability",,,
"Our new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers in just over three months",,,
"We expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we're pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer",,,
"Additionally, we saw a good performance in our next-generation data center switching platforms as customers continue to shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures and embrace multi-cloud adoption",,,
We continue to advance our intent-based networking for data center and private cloud environments with the latest software release of ACI,,,
"Over 4,000 ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility with network automation, simplified management and improved security",,,
"Going forward, we see a tremendous opportunity to benefit from a shift in customer demand from stand-alone products to integrated platforms with our intent-based infrastructure portfolio providing unmatched benefits",products_services,,
Now turning to applications,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Applications are absolutely central to every digital business strategy,,,
"To maximize their effectiveness, companies require a highly-secure network that closely monitors applications and workload performance across a complex multi-cloud environment",,,
"Our acquisition of AppDynamics is core to our capability of providing end-to-end analytics, from the network to the data center to the application",acquisitions,,
"Within our Applications business, we are enabling new capabilities based on advanced AI and machine learning across our portfolio",,,
"An example of this is our acquisition of Perspica, providing deep machine learning driven analytics to further extend AppDynamics' leading capabilities in application intelligence",acquisitions,,
"Additionally, we announced our latest innovation on the Cisco Spark platform, Spark Assistant, which is the world's first enterprise-ready, AI-powered voice assistant to further enhance our customers' meeting experience",,,
Our intended acquisition of BroadSoft will enhance our subscription and cloud-based business,acquisitions,,
"BroadSoft has 19 million subscribers in the growing cloud voice and contact center space and will enable Cisco to offer an even broader portfolio of collaboration solutions to our customers, on-premise and in the cloud",,,
We expect this acquisition to accelerate the pace of innovation in our Collaboration business and we see many opportunities to extend the reach of the BroadSoft portfolio,acquisitions,,
Moving to Security,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"With an expanding threat landscape, cybersecurity is the number one priority for businesses worldwide and is at the heart of every company's digital strategy",,,
"In a multi-cloud world, as our customers' environments become increasingly distributed, security requirements only increase",,,
"At Cisco, security continues to be a strategic imperative and fundamental to everything we do",,,
"As customers adopt and advance intent-based networking, our end-to-end security is the foundation to keep our customers protected from advanced threats",,,
"This architecture, combined with the best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud, enables our customers to reduce the time to detection, as well as complexity and cost",op_costs,,
"As a result, we believe Cisco is delivering the most effective and comprehensive security solutions in the market",,,
"This differentiated strategy drove the 8% revenue growth in our Security portfolio, and we also saw continued momentum in our Security deferred revenue, with 42% growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities",,,
I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead,sales,Positive,Confident
"We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative portfolio of offerings in the industry, powered by intent-based capabilities and delivered through a range of consumption models providing more flexibility than ever before",,,
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials,,,
"Yes, Mark",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Thanks for the question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio",products_services,Positive,Confident
We're pleased with the early feedback,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I'll tell you that our sales teams, our partners and our customers are very excited about the architecture that we've announced",sales,,
It's still one quarter,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So we have to get a little more time under our belt but what I will tell you is that when we look back at a transition like the 3850 years and years ago, it's very much in line",,,
"And I think that as more customers have the opportunity to test the automation and programmability and all of the software features that they're testing right now, we would hope that the platform continues to accelerate",,,Uncertain
So one quarter down but we feel good about where we are,,,Uncertain
"Well, thanks, Steve",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So what I said in the script is that a vast majority of our customers that are buying these platforms are opting for the advanced and I would say that it's a vast majority,,,
We knew when we introduced a subscription on a switch that we needed to ensure that there was unique innovation that was available to our customers in order for them to see value in that,,,
We couldn't just simply shift the capabilities that they had gotten before in a perpetual model,,,
We needed to drive new innovation,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So the anchors that are in that advanced subscription are the overall automation capability, which really gets at the OpEx of running these networks",,,
And the second part is the encrypted traffic analytics where we can determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it,,,
And we think that those two are phenomenal incremental capabilities that our customers didn't have before and I think that's why we're seeing such a high attach rate,,,Uncertain
So we're very pleased with where we are on that as well,,,
"So, Vijay, thanks for the question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We've been talking about this for several calls now, about how we reengaged with the large web scale providers back right after I became CEO",,,
And these are long processes as they made major architectural decisions and they have franchises that you're trying to reenter,,,
"But if you look at â€“ whether it's the announcements we made with Microsoft a couple of quarters ago, the announcement we made with Google, you alluded to Alibaba, which there's a summary of that win on our website if you want to go see that",,,
"It's our first insertion there, and actually it was before the large sales day that they experienced I think last week",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And so we continue to make progress and we're continuing to execute on what I told you that we're executing on over the last year and a half, which is trying to go deeper",,,
I think the other thing that has become eminently clear is that these large web scale providers realize that it is going be a multi-cloud world and they definitely have come to the conclusion that the edge is going be mission critical for our customers going forward,,,Uncertain
"And as they think about that, we are very natural â€“ we're the very natural partner for them to partner with as the network is the only common denominator across all these cloud environments all the way out to the edge of our enterprise customer's network",,,Uncertain
So we're just continuing to execute against what we set out two years ago and we hope to continue to see success,,,
"And I think, Paul, from a perspective of the web scale, it's really just what I described",,,Uncertain
We're in discussions with all of them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We have made announcements with several of them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And we continue to execute against our strategy and it's â€“ â€“ these are large franchises,,,
There's two facets,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And if you remember on a call back two or three calls back, I said that we're now expanding our discussions into 360-degree relationship discussions",,,
"The Google announcement was reflective of that comment, because not only are we working on their infrastructure but we're also working significantly on this multi-cloud enablement, hybrid cloud enablement and helping bridge our customers, their premises-based solutions, their edge-based solutions, their cloud applications, their SaaS applications",,,
And so we're continuing to execute on that right now,,,
"Kelly, do you want to",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yes, Ittai, so thanks for your comments by the way",,,
"On the hyperconverged offer, our HyperFlex offer, I would tell you that it has continued to probably be at the high end of my expectations",,,
I'd say couple of quarters ago it began to exceed what I was expecting so I changed my expectations and it's â€“ but they're doing a great job,,Positive,Confident
The teams are doing well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think we know the use cases where it's very competitive and I think that it continues to â€“ they continue to operate at the high end of what I expected from them,,,Uncertain
So we're very pleased with that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On the question relative to SD-WAN, I think you nailed it right",,,Uncertain
Our customers â€“ and we've talked about this for a couple of calls â€“ our customers have been trying to assess what this SD-WAN architectural transition looks like,,,
"And I think that after we acquired Viptela, we have now â€“ at our sales meeting we provided tremendous clarity to our sales organization and our partner community at the Partner Summit about what our strategy is",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
We've now taken customers through the road maps of what they can expect and how to position the different alternatives that we have and how those portfolios are going to come together over the next 12 to 18 months,,,
So I think that it is a by-product of the SD-WAN discussion,,,Uncertain
"And I would expect that we'll start to see customers move somewhat this quarter and then in the second half of the year, I think our customers will continue to begin to deploy some of these solutions",,,Uncertain
"So, again, happy with where we are relative to the positioning of the different platforms",,Positive,Confident
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, Tal, thanks for the question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me break it down,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So the advanced subscription today is primarily being sold on the new Catalyst 9000, even though it's backwards compatible with a couple of years' worth of our â€“ I don't know, two, three years' worth of products that we've shipped in wireless and in routing, et cetera",products_services,,
But what the customers are doing right now is they're basically becoming accustomed to the platform,,,
"They're testing the platform before they make an investment on any sort of backwards compatibility, is what I would tell you",organic_expansion,,
I don't think we need to make any changes right now because the attach rate of the most advanced subscription offer is at the very high end of what I would have expected,,,Uncertain
So I think we're very pleased with where it is right now,,,Uncertain
"And assuming we execute on the value and the innovation that our customers continue to gain from that, then I think that we'll begin to see them then buy the subscriptions on some of their install base as well",,,Uncertain
"Thanks, Mitch",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So I think that the thing that is resonating with the customer is if you're looking at the environments that they're all beginning to operate in, they're operating in an environment where they have multiple SaaS providers, multiple cloud providers",,,Uncertain
They've got their private data centers with applications running,,,
They've got their branch networks,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
They've got now edge connectivity with IoT coming in,,,
"And so, the robustness of an architecture that they have to have that protects across the network, across the endpoint, across the cloud is really what I think is differentiating it",,,Uncertain
"And we've also â€“ we've been on a multiyear journey of selling software and subscriptions against the threat intelligence and the malware intelligence that we have, and I think that's what's continuing to pay off",,,Uncertain
"So I think it's resonating with our customers and it's an architecture that we continue to innovate on, we continue to expand on",,,Uncertain
"And, Kelly, any comments on the",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Kelly, do you want to take",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"James, just to clarify one point or just add to actually, when Kelly says 12% of our product revenue is coming from recurring offers, just to put that in perspective, when I became CEO it was 6%, so we've effectively doubled that","sales,products_services",,
"And I think that's certainly helpful, and just we're seeing positive feedback on the launch",,,Uncertain
"So, I'm sorry that was Simon",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
In the enterprise switching?,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, thanks for the question, Jeff",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think that if you look at some of the performance we saw around the world, to your point, in Europe and Asia we've talked about Huawei's activity over the last couple of quarters, I would say that our teams have been very focused on it",,,Uncertain
I think that the intuitive network [The Network,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
] launch that we did in June really changes the discussion,,,
"And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is up front cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a five-year period, it's probably 10X the cost of the upfront hardware",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
So going and helping our customers really reduce that is a value proposition that helps us change the discussion relative to the competition,competition,,
So they continue to be very tough but we think that competing on the price of the box upfront is something that we can shift over the next couple of years,,,Uncertain
"Yes, Erik, thanks for that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So at our Financial Analyst Conference this summer, we articulated a long range guide in line with what you just described",,,
We're going to have quarters that are going to vary from that but that's definitely our long-term objective,,,
"And I think our teams are focused now on what is it we need to do for the next wave of this architecture? Once we have this architecture built where we can actually defend and apply real-time defense against known threats, we can learn about a threat through malware and e-mail, and we can protect against it in the network, in the cloud, in the devices at the endpoint all at the same time",,,Uncertain
So the teams are working hard to continue to drive innovation there but also looking at what other elements can we fit into this architecture over time,,,
And I think that's how we think about the long-term guide,,,Uncertain
"And, Jim, just the market segment perspective that is probably pretty clear",,,
We saw service provider pretty much the same as it has been for some period of time,products_services,,
"Our largest enterprise customers, which the way we define it is really just is an organizational segment that we have",,,
"We did see â€“ we saw negative mid single digits there, which you saw in the slides",,,
"In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see",sales,Positive,Confident
Our enterprise customers what I would tell you is that they're some of the biggest customers who take the longest amount of time to evaluate new platforms and new capabilities like The Network,,,
as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we're actively in those discussions with the enterprise customers,,,
And our commercial customers tend to just move more quickly than others,,,
"And then finally, on the public sector side, which we didn't talk about a lot, I think the big call out there I would say is that two quarters ago we talked about the pressure in the federal business",,,Uncertain
Last quarter we said we saw it improving and what I would tell you is that in this quarter we saw the year-end it seemed fairly normal,,,
While they still have a lot of leadership roles that haven't been filled and we still have the impending December debt ceiling issue overall for this quarter we saw the federal business pretty much back to what we expected as we closed the quarter,debt,,
So that's probably the commentary I could provide on the market segments,,,
"Well, that's it, isn't it?",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'll wrap it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks, everyone again for joining us today",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I just want to wrap with a few points,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First off, we are committed to executing on this vision to deliver a highly secure intelligent platform for our customers' digital business",,,
And we are laser focused on five key elements of that strategy to enable our customers' success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"First, we are fundamentally reinventing networking with our intent-based networking platform",,,
"We intend to further accelerate our leadership here extending intuitive technologies across the broad portfolio that we have while increasing application, visibility and automation",,,
"Secondly, security is fundamental to everything we do",,,
"You can't build a next generation digital business without a comprehensive security strategy across endpoints, network and the cloud",,,
"Third, it is very clear that it's a multi-cloud world, and Cisco is in a unique position to help our customers navigate this by expanding our multi-cloud portfolio and extending our web scale partnerships with strategic cloud providers",,,
Our Google partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers,,,
"Fourth, we're unlocking the power of the data with advanced analytics such as our solutions AppDynamics, encrypted traffic analytics and Talos threat intelligence",,,
We're also embedding AI and machine learning technologies across the breadth of our portfolio,,,
"And lastly, we will continue to deliver a more enhanced customer and employee experience through our broad Collaboration portfolio including our intent to acquire BroadSoft",,,
"Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thank you, Mark, and welcome to everyone",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'm excited to join you today in my new role at Citrix,,,
"As you can see, the business results are strong",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As Mark shared, top line revenue is in line with our forecasts, growing 3% year-on-year, but that alone really doesn't tell the full story",sales,,
"When you look at bookings and deferred revenue, we saw a significant acceleration in our business last quarter, including 76 deals over $1 million of which nine were for Citrix Cloud",sales,,
We can directly see the model shift when measuring the percentage of product bookings in the quarter that came in as subscription-based versus perpetual,products_services,,
"In Q2, this mix of subscription doubled year-on-year to 30% of the product bookings mix, driving the increase in deferred revenue, which as Mark mentioned, over $1.7 billion, up more than 13% year-on-year","sales,products_services",,
"In fact, the total contract value of bookings for Workspace Services was up more than 10% from last year with an average contract duration approaching three years",products_services,,
"We're also beginning to see this move show up in recognized SaaS revenue which is growing quickly, up 27% year-on-year, and we expect to accelerate throughout the back half of this year",sales,,
"Up until now, we've been trying to gradually manage this move to a more subscription-based model, but the rapid shift in demand from customers is showing that we need to be much more aggressive and speed up this transition moving forward",,,
The faster-than-expected shift is a strong indicator of our customers' belief in our long-term vision,,Positive,Confident
They want their infrastructure to run in either a hybrid or a SaaS model,,,
Our holistic approach gives customers the confidence that they can transition to the cloud at their own pace with Citrix and have the future flexibility to access cloud-based innovations that their businesses are going to need,,,
The move to subscription is obviously impacting the P&L in the short term for both revenue and margin,"sales,earnings",,
"As we work on the plan to move faster, we're going to do so with a commitment to operational efficiency",op_risks,,
"We're recognizing that OpEx is up significantly over the last few quarters, as Mark mentioned, both from variable expenses as well as investments in multiple areas of the company","op_costs,organic_expansion",,
"Looking forward, our goal is to manage the business closely through this transition so that we can both accelerate our move to subscription while balancing op margin both over the medium and long term","sales,earnings",,
"We're currently working on a multiyear plan including capital, and we expect to share these details and metrics on the Q3 call",,,
Citrix has a mission that has remained largely unchanged for nearly 30 years and we have a strategy that is clearly resonating with our customers,,,
It's now our job to be more intentional about the transformation needed in all areas of the business to drive solid growth and profitability into the future,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Looking at our products, I believe we currently have the strongest product portfolio and roadmap that I've seen in my tenure with the company",products_services,Positive,Confident
"Our desktop and app business is accelerating because the cloud and hybrid approach gives customers the flexibility they want, along with the growing need for security-use cases",,,
"We're seeing this especially with large competitive wins worldwide, particularly in education and healthcare during Q2. For example, a large U.S",,,
"health system and a major Korean university chose Citrix to better manage their cloud transitions while maintaining the security and compliance needed, and alleviating growing concerns around ransomware and malware within their organizations",,,
"In the networking space, we're seeing our Enterprise segment bookings grow in the double digits because of our capacity investments, as well as our software-based architecture strategy",organic_expansion,,
Organizations are clearly going to evolve their networks to a more software-defined perimeter approach over time,,,
"And since NetScaler is a software platform, we're very well positioned to meet our customers' needs well into the future without forcing them to go through a complex and expensive hardware refresh cycle",,,
"For example, Masonite International, a large building products manufacturer, was facing an end of life on a competitor's hardware platform this quarter",products_services,,
"They weighed upgrading with that competitor with switching to Citrix's NetScaler, ultimately choosing NetScaler with the addition of XenApp citing both Citrix's product integration capabilities and the completeness of vision to help them well into the future as unmatched reasons for this switch",products_services,,
"Looking at our partnerships, our product alignment with Microsoft is driving real results",products_services,,
"This quarter we saw many large joint customer wins for Citrix Cloud with Microsoft Azure driven by the strength, usability and simplicity of our solution",,,
"Arizona State University, for example, which is currently undergoing a hybrid cloud effort as part of a new Cloud first IT initiative is just one large example",,,
"In addition to that, one of the world's largest advertising, marketing and communications agencies, as well as one of the world's largest professional software firms both chose Citrix Cloud on Azure in multimillion-dollar deals driven by cost, efficiency and security concerns",op_costs,,
A professional services firm needed an IT environment built from the ground up for one of its divisions to meet U.S,products_services,,
"government regulations, and they cited Citrix Cloud on Microsoft Azure as the single easiest and most secure way to mobilize their workforce and meet their regulatory compliance needs",,,
And the work that we're doing is extending to other partners as well,,,
"This quarter, we announced an expanded partnership with Google to bring Citrix Cloud's desktop and application delivery and NetScaler CPS to the Google Cloud Platform, and to better integrate ShareFile and the security and control that we can offer with the full G Suite of solutions",,,
"And just this week, we'll be announcing the availability of Citrix SD-WAN 9.3 with an extended partnership to make it available on the AWS marketplace",,,
This is just the start of the investments to offer customers choice and flexibility into how they manage their IT environments with any platform provider,organic_expansion,,
"From a competitive standpoint, we had more than 1,100 competitive wins in our core areas",,,
"For example, M&T Bank replaced a major competitor of XenMobile because of better user experience and features like single-touch desktop access and our ability to securely integrate with our existing NetScaler infrastructure",,,
"In fact, several customers also replaced networking competitors with NetScaler, including Telecom Italia, citing superior performance, usability, stability and overall scalability as the driving factors in these large deals",,,
"And overall we're also seeing several big desktop replacements when displacement transactions, including one of the large medical foundations, a major hospital system and a large services company, driven by the advanced performance and quality of our solutions and the unique Citrix-only capabilities like integration with ShareFile to deliver a complete workspace solution",products_services,,
"So to sum it all up, business is strong",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We recognize that our profitability is getting pressured by the cloud transition,earnings,,
"Going forward, we're going to manage both the transition and efficiencies in a balanced manner",,,
"We have, clearly, work to do, but you'll see our response over the next several quarters",,,
"Additionally, we're working hard to align the entire company towards a multiyear cloud transformation, and as I said, after Q3 of this year, we intend to share new metrics and our multiyear plan so everyone can better understand the rapid pace of our evolution, the demands we're seeing from our customers in our hybrid cloud vision",,,
Thank you very much,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And as always, we look forward to your questions",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The quickest way to answer that is just look at the mix from Q2. Just about 85% of the mix was coming from new customers or maybe existing customers with new use cases,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
The remaining 15% was coming from an installed base that was just doing a migration,,,
"So at this point in time, the vast majority is net new",,,
"It's the way we've designed it for this year, one of the reasons why it's impacting the top line as much as it has been",sales,,
"I mean, we haven't had any change in leadership across our R&D and innovation engine",,,
"In fact, it's stronger than it has been in many, many, many years now",,Positive,Confident
"We've got two great leaders running both product and engineering, and we've recently gone through a unification from an org model standpoint to bring together all of our product and engineering efforts",products_services,Positive,Confident
"And the driver there is really just to allow us to move faster, to deliver integrated solutions both on-prem and the cloud, and I feel really good about our roadmap",,,Uncertain
We're releasing a number of new capabilities,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Just released like, for example, a NetScaler software web gateway, which is a web security solution with user behavior analytics built into it",,,
"It's an extension of really what we're doing across the broader NetScaler platform, leverages mass and various other web services like threat intelligence, et cetera",products_services,,
So we're working hard across all those fronts and I think you should expect to see more innovation coming from us as you go forward,,,Uncertain
"Overall, I think it's going quite well",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean it's just to remind everyone, we announced a voluntary migration in the first half of the year",,,
We had a couple of promotions going,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In the second period, roughly 40% of customers that were renewing chose to renew on CSS, versus their option to renew on subscription advantage",,,
"The uptick in price we saw on an ASP basis was about 19%, so it's moving exactly as we expect",,,
The mandatory migration starts right now in the beginning of Q3. So this is the part where we're being just a little bit cautious to make sure that we understand any potential impact to renewal rates or ASPs,,,
"But as of right now, we haven't seen any degradation",,,
We feel very good about it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Our challenge is just make sure that we're out and educating customers along the way,,,
"So feel really good, good progress and we'll see over the back half of the year",,,Uncertain
"Sure, Kash",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First off, thank you",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I appreciate the support,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Second, in terms of â€“ you had a number of questions in there, and I'd probably bucket all those in the context of our multiyear plan",,,
"I mean, the leadership team right now is working aggressively to lay out what is effectively a 2020 plan",,,
"And within that, we're looking at the pace at which we want to shift to a subscription-based model, both in a hybrid fashion and in pure SaaS",,,
"We're looking at where we can (19:43) accelerates margin expansion over that three-year timeframe, and as I mentioned earlier, we're looking at capital in the context of that as well","sales,earnings",,
So a lot of work to do,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're doing that over the course of the next three months,,,
We'll talk about it on the quarter,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We see a lot of opportunities,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We see opportunities to not only run the business more efficiently but to actually deliver an acceleration of customer value by migrating them to the cloud,,,
"If you think about some of the transitions we've already started making in the last few months around reorganizing the engineering team, the product teams and all these others",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"And as I said to Rob's question, that's going to accelerate our ability to innovate and deliver tightly integrated solutions on a faster time scale",,,
And that's important because frankly that's what customers are looking for right now,,,
So I'd say stay tuned,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Give us three months to finish out this plan,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Overall, we're excited about where we can go and we think there's opportunities both to accelerate revenue and deliver leverage expansion over the next three years","sales,products_services",Neutral,Uncertain
"Kash, let us do the work, and then come back with some real specifics",,,
"But what I will say around that is you look at the last three quarters, as a percent of product mix, we've gone from 10% to 20% to 30%, and that's a reflection of customer demand, it's a reflection of making it comp neutral, and it's a reflection of really where we're going",products_services,,
"I will say for the balance of this year, we'll probably settle out somewhere around this 30%, 35% of the mix for the back half",sales,,
"And as we go into next year, we're going to be much more programmatic in terms of how we're driving alignment with both our field-facing teams as well as our partner network, how we're aligning the offers and we're aligning incentives",,,
"But in terms of the output, we're still working on it, so we'll come back in a few months and just lay out metrics, as well as a three-year expectation for revenue and margin and EPS at the same time","sales,earnings",,
"In terms of top line, like I said just a second ago, we're assume about a third of the mix is going to be coming via subscription on a go-forward basis, that's what it looks like in Q3 and in Q4 as well",sales,,
We're working hard on expenses right now,op_costs,,
We were running hot in the first half of the year,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Some of that's variable expense because as we're migrating to the cloud, bookings are running ahead of plan but we're paying all the variable comp and commissions upfront and recognizing the revenue over an extended period","sales,op_costs",,
"There's also been a number of investments in other parts of the business, and the leadership team is working on where do we prioritize and where do we focus on the back half of the year",organic_expansion,,
"So again, I'd say stay tuned",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The core takeaway is that business has been very strong, but the subscription mix is moving faster than we anticipated, more than double the pace that we were expecting a year ago",sales,Positive,Confident
So that's going to impact the P&L in the short term,,,
"Sure, Michael",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, we didn't get into a whole lot of details on the prepared remarks, but when you look at networking in total, there's a couple of things that I would point out",,,
"First, in the aggregate, there's a little bit of a headwind, about a $10 million headwind from some portfolio rationalization we did a year ago",,,
That was the last big quarter for ByteMobile and so that one is effectively zero right now so we got a little bit of a headwind there,,,
"In terms of the overall business, I mean, we did make a pass at the investments last year across what is largely enterprise accounts",organic_expansion,,
The fastest-growing part of the networking business has been in pure play,,,
"So if you think about our kind of three main markets, service providers attached to other Citrix solutions and what I would call pure-play ADC, the pure play was up strong double digits in the quarter so we're actually being able to engage and win in a much greater number of competitive transactions",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
And part of the reason there is just simply what we've said for the last several quarters,,,
We've got a software-based platform that allows customers to have much more flexibility,,,
We're not relying on a rip-and-replace hardware cycle for growth at this point in time,sales,Positive,Confident
"We've got a number of different innovations that we've brought forward like MAS, our Management Analytics System, which provides a nice competitive differentiator",,,
"We've created pooled-capacity licensing so customers can share capacity across their cloud and prem models, and a number of other innovations is allowing us to grow pretty aggressively",,,
"So that's what we're doing so that's the primary strategy, expand the base and drive share, and we've been successful over the last couple of quarters doing that",,,
"Mark, it's an imperfect number so that's the caveat",,,
"If you were to look at all things that were delivered via subscription and you were to change that to a perpetual license, it's probably approaching $100 million for the year",,,
But I want to put the caveat on that that there will always be some level of subscription,,,
"So it's a little bit apples and oranges, but that's an approximate number the way to think about it",,,Uncertain
Best way to measure the business in the short-term is look at the other metrics,,,
"Not just reported revenue but the fact that deferred revenue was up 13%, roughly 10% current, 20% long-term",sales,,
Billings growth was 8.5%,sales,Positive,Confident
We did have double-digit bookings growth across all three of our main businesses so the underlying trends have been positive,sales,Positive,Confident
It does tend to be more back-end loaded,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but roughly it would be 60%, maybe as much as 65% of the renewal pool would come up in the Q3, Q4 timeframe",,Neutral,Uncertain
"I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about, Kirk",,,
"But, overall, I'd say if you look at the field organization, and the big takeaway is that we're executing now internationally whereas we had been driving a lot of the growth domestically over the last couple of years",sales,Positive,Confident
"As we've talked about, a lot of work went into the U.S",,,
"back in the 2013, 2014, 2015 timeframe",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We started that work later in the international markets and now they're delivering significant growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"EMEA was up mid-singles, APJ had the second double-digit quarter in a row, and those teams are really coming together and starting to jell",,,
"I'd say in terms of the actual focus from the teams, we've made it comp neutral in terms of selling subscriptions versus perpetual license for the most part, and so we're not really trying to drive one or the other",,,
"Obviously, as we go through a more longer term transition, we'll be thinking about that in more ACD terms versus TCD",,,Uncertain
"But that's a transformation that's 2018, not 2017.",,,
"No, it's the latter, Kirk",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's not just the mix shift,sales,,
"I mean, we're running ahead on our original bookings plan and we've also taken some discretionary expenses as well",op_costs,,
So we have the ability to moderate expense growth and do that in a way that expense growth looks more close to revenue growth,"sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"Two things, in terms of the top line, it's a reasonably seasonal ramp for the enterprise business",sales,,
I think the thing that's masked that for a lot of people as they looked historically is how much was coming off of SaaS from the GoTo properties,,,Uncertain
"Besides that, we're just looking at things coming off the balance sheet plus the current bookings forecast",,,
We are building up more and more off the balance sheet so that will provide a cushion over time as well,,,
The place where you're going to see that hit the P&L is most directly through the SaaS line,,,
"That number has started to accelerate over the last couple of quarters and I would expect that as we go into the back half of the year, we'll exit north of 40% growth in SaaS revenue for Q4 as well",sales,Positive,Confident
So that's a place you'll start to see that come back in,,,
"In terms of OpEx, I don't want to get into any details",,,
"Like I said, we're looking at prioritization and where we're going to drive spending in the back half",,,
"Yeah, unit growth was strong",sales,Positive,Confident
It was low double-digit unit growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"Yeah, Josh, I can't talk to the individual one-offs",,,
"I mean, there's always situations where every large deal as you'd imagine is highly competitive",,,
We do tend to be the higher priced competitor,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We don't lead on price, historically, so I'd have to understand more detail to give you a specific answer",,,
"But I looked at ASPs coming out of the quarter, and for the most part, ASPs are unchanged as to where they were a year ago",,,
"So in the aggregate, not a big shift",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"At a micro level, yes, it's a hypercompetitive environment right now",,,
"I mean, there is almost never a transaction over a couple hundred thousand dollars that isn't a head-to-head bake off with some other competitor",,,
We are not going to win on price,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's not a long-term strategy,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're going to win on integrations and features and performance,,,
"We will get aggressive on price if we have to in some circumstances like everyone will, but that's certainly not our strategy",,,
"Yeah, I mean, the Operations and Capital Committee, we created another committee on the board to help management as we accelerate some of our multiyear planning",op_risks,,
"The focus is going to be around looking at our cloud transformation and helping us test a lot of those assumptions, operations in the P&L as it relates to margins and other","sales,earnings,op_risks",,
"We'll work with them on capital planning, and we'll work with them on helping vet M&A ideas",acquisitions,,
So just to work collaboratively with the leadership team,,,
"I wouldn't anticipate that you're going to have any large announcements from this, but it's just in the context of us transforming the business and doing it as quickly as we can",,,
"Well, thank you again for joining us today",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We hope that everyone is excited as we are for the next great chapter in Citrix's transformation,,Positive,Confident
I'd say we're moving quickly,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're driving customer value, and we're really looking forward to sharing the details of our multiyear plan with you at the end of this quarter",,,
Thanks again,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Talk to you in three months,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks, Frank",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Like other members of our leadership team, I spend much of my time with our strategic clients",,,
"And I listen for new ways to add value to their businesses, including how to help speed their transformation journey",,,
"Our clients of course pay close attention to the rising expectations of their customers and the competitive moves of their peers, so they know how fast things are changing and how easy it is to be left behind if their business, operating, and technology models are not digital through and through",,,
We're responding by investing in the build-out of repeatable industry-specific solutions that we can deploy across our practices,,,
These platforms solve pressing problems and deliver measurable results,,,
"Frank talked about clients needing to digitize their entire enterprises, so let's look at a few examples of how they're deploying digital at scale",,,
Many consumer product companies today are running to catch up to their retailers' new expectations for engaging customers,products_services,,
Retailers expect relevant product suggestions and self-service channels as well as speed and convenience when placing orders with their suppliers,products_services,,
"In response, Cognizant has developed a next-gen sales platform that enables businesses to acquire and retain more customers and sell more product","sales,products_services",,
"Next-gen sales is built on our Onvida SaaS platform, which is a cloud-based and omni-channel",sales,,
"You may recall that Onvida also serves as the foundation for the physician and patient communication network of LifeBridge Health, a client I talked about last quarter",,,
"To create next-gen sales, we have integrated digital commerce, email marketing, account acquisition, and advanced analytics in one platform","sales,acquisitions",,
Consider the impact of this platform on a large consumer products client,products_services,,
"This organization needed to replace its traditional phone-based sales operation with a digital ordering and service platform, a true digital commerce and marketing portal","sales,products_services,op_risks",,
They also wanted to become more effective at cross-selling and upselling products by applying advanced analytics,products_services,,
"In just a few quarters, we ramped from inception to production",products_services,,
We are now in the process of onboarding their thousands of B2B customers as we move more than 25% of their phone transactions to digital channels,,,
Among the benefits they will see are: a significant uplift in revenue; a double-digit reduction in operating costs; and a far more compelling customer experience,"sales,op_costs",,
"Many companies face similar challenges and need cloud-based digital commerce solutions, so we see plenty of market opportunity for our next-gen sales platform",sales,,
Another area where operating models need to be modernized and automated is workflows,,,
"To bring intelligence to these workflows, we've developed and are deploying our proprietary digital automation fabric",,,
"This fabric combines image recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and process automation",,,
Here are two examples of clients applying our advanced framework,,,
"For a leading mortgage information service provider, we've worked to redesign the workflows of their loan origination, servicing, and support functions",products_services,,
"The result, our implementation reduces staff by a third and can pass (14:55) more than 200 million pages a year with data accuracy that exceeds 99%",,,
"And for a global property and casualty insurer, our deployment has substantially reduced unnecessary claims and saved tens of millions of dollars",,,
We continue to expand this framework to other industry solutions,,,
Now I want to turn to the financial performance of our business segments and geographies,,,
Let's start with banking and financial services,products_services,,
"Second quarter revenues were up 4.1% year over year, driven mostly by our growth in insurance",sales,Positive,Confident
"In insurance, we're seeing broad-based growth across clients and strong demand for multi-service line managed service deals",products_services,Positive,Confident
"The overall performance of our banking clients has improved from the first quarter, but we still see large money center banks taking a conservative approach to their spending and continuing to focus on optimizing their cost structures",op_costs,,
This is being partly offset by continued strong growth in our mid-tier accounts,sales,Positive,Confident
"In healthcare, our second quarter revenues were up 9.5% year over year, driven by both our life science and payer clients",sales,,
"Broadly, we've seen a healthy pickup in demand across our payer clients",,,
This includes pent-up demand from those healthcare payers involved in M&A activity last year,acquisitions,,
The healthcare industry continues to shift from fee-for-service to value-based care models,products_services,,
"In response, healthcare organizations seek new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiency and lowering medical costs","op_costs,op_risks",,
These competitive pressures persist despite continued uncertainty about the ACA's future,,,
"We've invested heavily in our healthcare practice, creating a differentiated offering that has positioned us well to meet evolving client demand",,,
And we're actively helping many of our clients manage through this transition,,,
"Let's turn to our other business segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology",products_services,,
Today they make up over a third of our total company's revenue and are meaningful contributors to our growth and our portfolio diversification,sales,Positive,Confident
Products and Resources grew 13.2% year over year as a result of continued strong performance with our manufacturing and logistics clients,products_services,Positive,Confident
"As these clients sensor-enable their products, they're embracing enterprise digital transformation",products_services,,
"To harness the power of their connected products, we must rearchitect and transform their supporting business processes as well as simplify and modernize their technology models",products_services,,
That's how they'll create new digital products and drive new revenue streams,"sales,products_services",,
"Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 16.8% year over year",sales,Positive,Confident
Our clients in CMT are focused on creating a differentiated experience that delivers personalized content to their customers,,,
"Doing so requires each client to efficiently and effectively manage content, from acquisition through targeted distribution and analytics",acquisitions,,
We're responding with a repeatable digital content operations solution,op_risks,,
"It uses human intervention, machine learning, and digital platforms to ensure the right content is viewed by the right person at the right time and place",,,
Now let's look at our performance in emerging geographies,,,
Europe was up 5.7% year over year after a 6.1% negative currency impact,,,
"This was driven by strength on the continent in key markets such as France and the Netherlands and by strategic investments made in the second half of 2016. By the way, earlier this month we opened our new London Digital Business Collaboratory",organic_expansion,,
This co-lab combines human-centric design with digital technologies to enable clients to deliver engaging new experiences for their customers,,,
"To close out our geographic discussion, we had continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 21.2% year over year",sales,Positive,Confident
This growth was driven by key Asia-Pacific markets such as India and Australia,sales,Positive,Confident
"And just as we have done in continental Europe, we're building a strong local presence and investing both organically and inorganically in these emerging markets",organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
"In recent calls, we've talked about Cognizant's evolving workforce and delivery",,,
I'd like to add a few points to this discussion,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The engines of our digital practice areas are our talented and deeply skilled professionals,,,
"To ensure they stay on digital's cutting edge, we're investing tens of millions of dollars this year to continuously deepen and broaden their skills in areas such as analytics, artificial intelligence, data science, and digital security",,,
Cognizant is also building skills and capabilities in local communities where we operate around the world,,,
One way is by partnering with educational institutions to establish and fund retraining programs in high-demand digital technologies,,,
"For example, we partner with Per Scholas, a national organization to create a job training program in the south Bronx",,,
"It's designed to help New Yorkers access career opportunities in tech, and we plan to hire at least 350 of the program's initial graduates for our client sites in New York's five boroughs",,,
"We've also been developing similar training programs in Des Moines, Tampa, Phoenix, and Charlotte as well as internationally",,,
"For example, in Singapore we're partnering with educational institutions to provide the local community with STEM-related training",,,
"And in Switzerland, we run an apprentice program that trains students in application development and testing",,,
"In short, our company runs on talent, and we remain committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent in the world",,,
"To wrap up, we're driving digital scale by building repeatable industry-specific solutions that enable clients to add significantly more value to their businesses",,,
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to cover our financial performance,,,
"Hey, Brian, this is Raj",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Look, I think when you look at healthcare, we've invested very heavily on our healthcare practice, and it's really created a differentiated offering which has positioned us well",,,Uncertain
"And if you look at the entire practice, with what's happening with the healthcare ecosystems, with the providers, the payers, and the pharma, with all the collaboration that's going on there, and these are all big practices for us, so I think that we're positioned very well in healthcare",,,Uncertain
"And in addition to that, we've talked about last year we had a couple large M&A transactions, and obviously with those going away, you see a lot of the pent-up demand",acquisitions,,
So there's still some uncertainty with what happens with the ACA,,,
"But overall, I think this year and going into next year with the position we are, we're well positioned",,,Uncertain
"Regarding some of the BPO, we haven't seen any impact on that at all",,,
"Hi, Jim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
This is Raj,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So look, I think the overall financial services, I think if we look at the entire practice, obviously insurance continued doing well",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Where the challenge is, is a little bit on the banking side",,,
"And as we talked about, regional banks are healthy, strong growth",sales,Positive,Confident
Where we're challenged is on a couple of the large money-center banks,,,
The good news here is obviously we're in a better position than I think we were at this time last year with them,,,Uncertain
"But as we look out, they're still very much focused on the cost side and optimizing that, but we are, obviously, engaged with many of them on digital-type engagements",op_costs,,
"Now as these projects become larger scale enterprise initiatives, I think we're well positioned to benefit from that",,,Uncertain
"But right now, that's our focus area right now in terms of continuing to invest and continuing to be well positioned for those large enterprise transformations",,,
"Moshe, the large money central banks obviously have both a European and U.S",,,
So I think you're seeing softness there because of the discretionary work not kicking in as fast as we would like it,,,Uncertain
"Now again, like I said, we're engaged in a lot of the digital initial work with those banks",,,
"And as these banks continue to get healthier, I would expect that you would start seeing some more of the enterprise transformation initiatives that we're expecting",,,
And I think we're well positioned,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"If you look at it from the business to the operations to the technology layers, I think there are very few companies that can help these banks",,,Uncertain
"And so that's obviously areas that we're investing in, and we're hopeful for future growth as they get healthier",sales,Positive,Confident
"I have nothing to add to that, Joe",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We could say that as we continue the process of building out regional centers in the U.S,,,
"as opposed to our historical model where folks have been more onsite in our client locations, I think that that will help drive utilization actually higher, because when we have people in a physical location, our ability to redeploy them across clients and so on and so forth, the project then becomes higher",,,Uncertain
Now that's a longer-term trend,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Our journey of building out regional centers is well underway, but we have some ways to go on that",,,
"So I think as regional centers become a greater portion of our overall onsite workforce, I think that will be a contributor to being able to take onsite utilization up higher",,,Uncertain
"And I think, operator, we have time for one more question",,,Uncertain
"Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today",,,
Cognizant delivered solid third quarter results,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Q3 revenue was $3.77 billion, which is at the high end of our guided range and up 9.1% year-over-year",sales,,
Three of our four business segments were strong contributors to our performance,,Positive,Confident
"Healthcare, product and resources and communications and media and technology averaged double digit growth rates",products_services,Positive,Confident
Our third quarter digital related revenue grew well above company average,sales,Positive,Confident
"And to further enhance our digital capabilities, we recently announced two acquisitions",acquisitions,,
"Netcentric, a leading independent Adobe partner in Europe and a leading provider of digital experience and marketing solutions for some of the world's most recognized brands",,,
"And Zone, a UK based leading independent full service digital agency that specializes in interactive digital strategy, technology and content creation",products_services,,
These acquisitions will broaden our portfolio of digital services and solutions,"products_services,acquisitions",,
"To continue with our financial results, non-GAAP EPS quarter for the quarter was $0.98 and our non-GAAP operating margin was 20%","sales,earnings",,
"For 2017, we delivered three consecutive quarters of strong execution at the top and bottom lines",earnings,Positive,Confident
This consistent performance underscores the soundness of our strategy and investments and the continuing strong demand for our portfolio of services,"products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Turning to guidance, we are again raising the low end of our revenue guidance range and expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.78 billion and $14.84 billion",sales,,
And we expect our full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 19.6%,"sales,earnings",,
"Now, we're in the business to help our clients adapt, compete and grow in the face of continual shifts and disruptions within their markets",,,
"Therefore, we've systematically built out significant capabilities to enable clients to transition from the physical to the digital world",,,
Today making that shift has become mandatory for them,,,
"Most clients now know they must become digital enterprises themselves or more precisely, the right mix of physical and digital",sales,,
"So we work with them to transform their business, operating and technology models simultaneously",,,
This three layer transformation is what we mean when we talk about digital at scale,,,
"In prior calls, we've discussed how we enabled this transformation, applying our deep industry knowledge, innovation, advanced technologies and consulting expertise",,,
"More recently, we've also been emphasizing our client co-innovation centers and our platform based software and solutions",,,
The result of developing and integrating all these capabilities and intellectual property is that we are turning Cognizant into a different kind of company that's envisioning and building the digital economy,,,
"Increasingly, we see ourselves as a leading firm that develops repeatable solutions by infusing software and services to deliver business outcomes that make a real difference to clients",products_services,,
"And this morning, I'd like to highlight how this new Cognizant is resonating with clients and winning in digital",,,
"The best place to begin is with a few client examples of digital at scale, delivering a competitive upside for Cognizant",,,
"For a US car company that's preparing for a future of ride sharing and driverless cars, a team of consultants, developers and social scientists from Cognizant and ReD associates help to reimagine the relationship between driver and automaker",,,
And then they jointly develop a marketplace that offers mobility services to help drivers move around more easily and access services remotely from vehicle diagnostics to smart parking reservations,products_services,,
"For a leading financial institution facing slowing growth in a major business, Cognizant developed an artificial intelligence enabled robotic investment advisor that would appeal to a new market of approximately 90 million millennials and that will enable the firm to achieve its goal of doubling retail assets under management by 2020. To envision and build this digital solution, we brought a cross-functional team from the client together with Cognizant digital business designers, strategists, technologists and financial services experts","products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,NIL
And we also helped a leading life sciences company bring to market new drugs with proven therapeutic benefits for smaller patient populations,,,
"We assembled a team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and technology and design consultants to drive efficiencies in the clinical development process and apply digital marketing techniques",,,
"As a result, the client was able to achieve the goal of bringing new therapies to even relatively small patient populations",,,
"Absent this new approach, these drugs might not have been economical to develop and market",,,
The upside for Cognizant is that most of the world's companies are now dealing with these digital at scale challenges in one form or another,,,
"And therefore, we can keep combining our services and software in new ways to create repeatable solutions for a wide variety of clients",products_services,,
"Now, enterprise transformation is such a demanding work that we make sure that all our services and solutions are organized from the client's perspective, which is why last year we established Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant Digital systems and technology","products_services,op_risks",,
"These three practice areas, which run across our business segment, mirror our client needs and the parts of their enterprises they need to transform",,,
And Raj will talk about how our digital practices are progressing in solving client's current and emerging challenges,,,
"Within these practices, our value to clients hinges of course on the depth, breadth and currency of our knowledge",,,
"So we've been aggressively building high-end digital skills in areas such as data science, design thinking, cyber security, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and automation",,,Uncertain
But strong digital skills alone are not enough,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, we combine these skills with our industry expertise to speak the language and understand the core processes and technologies of every industry we specialize it",,,
And we draw on this knowledge to build specialized software platforms and industry specific solutions to quickly create new value for clients,,,
You can see all of this come together for example in the way we've invested to extend our leadership as a fully integrated digital healthcare technology and operations provider,op_risks,,
"We've made major health care investments, beginning with the TriZetto healthcare administration platform, a leading software platform used by payers and providers",organic_expansion,,
"Earlier this year, we moved our TriZetto products to the Microsoft Azure Cloud and launched our healthcare cloud solution, a SaaS platform for healthcare payers of any size",products_services,,
"And having completed the TMG Health acquisition in August, we've now combined TriZetto with the business process services of TMG","products_services,acquisitions",,
TMG Health has further strengthened our scalable business process as a service or BPAAS solution for the government and public health program markets,products_services,,
"These investments along with our market leading footprint in the commercial space establish Cognizant as the top solution provider of enhanced government processed platforms, digital solutions and services for commercial and government managed healthcare programs in the US","products_services,organic_expansion",,
"Since TriZetto, we have invested in many other platforms in areas such as digital content operations, sales transformation, mortgage servicing and patient safety","sales,op_risks",,
"All of these technologies and platforms provide the benefit of scale, enabling Cognizant to develop repeatable offerings that can be used by multiple clients across multiple markets",,,
"While digital at scale is a heavy lift, Cognizant has the resume to execute this transformation successfully",,,
It starts with a high level of client trust that encourages and enables the successful co-innovation of solutions with clients,,,
"Once we've established for the future, we know how to design, prototype and scale digital experiences to reshape clients, products and business models",products_services,,
But building digital experiences for the front end of a client's business is not enough,,,
"We have the deep knowledge to help clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their core business processes and build software platform for specific processes and industries",,,

These acquisitions in a sense will allow us to put a front end on a lot of that work that we're doing and take that to a client in a more integrated and holistic way,acquisitions,,

We'll execute on the revenue synergy by bringing them - largely by bringing them into our clients,sales,,
We think there maybe some opportunity to cross-sell our traditional services into their clients and we'll continue to execute on that going forward,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Yeah, I think what I was referring to when I talked about repeatable is the sort of the solution packages and solution offerings that we're creating which we've been talking to you about in the past things like our BPaaS offerings and so on and so forth",,,Uncertain
"By combining sort of our services and software capabilities increasingly together, we're creating these - think of them as solution offerings capabilities that we take to the market",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
We've always as a company tracked repeat business from our existing clients,,,
"And I think that's where you'll really start - where you really see it continue to play out is repeat business from our existing clients because that's going to be the metric that we focus on is to say, are we continuing to be relevant to our existing clients",,,Uncertain
"And to be relevant to our existing clients, we've got to continue to innovate, we've got to continue to find new sources of value and that shows up in repeat business because every year or every period, our clients are assessing the work we're doing for them and they're choosing to give us new work based on the relevance of that work",,,

"Specifically for the first quarter, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-teens over last year's first quarter",,,
"This is down mid-single digits sequentially, driven by two fewer production days in the quarter and a reduction in panel maker capacity",products_services,Negative,NIL
"As context, late in Q4, Korean panel makers began to take down some lines, to convert the flexible OLED manufacturing for smart phones",,,
"New fabs are coming online over the course of 2017. Therefore, panel capacity will increase throughout the year",,,
"When one panel maker reduces production in one fab, other panel makers will need to produce more to meet retail demand",products_services,,
"We expect to maintain our worldwide share position, due to our broad and diversified customer base",,,
"We believe the full-year 2017 glass price declines will be more moderate than 2016. In fact, we may see the smallest declines in the last five years, as the profitability of our competitors remains low and supply/demand remains in balance",earnings,Negative,NIL

Recall from our strategy and capital allocation framework that we plan on investing $10 billion from 2016 to 2019 in growth and sustained leadership which included capital spending,sales,Positive,Confident
We said the pace of CapEx would be dependent on customer demand,organic_expansion,,
We anticipate investing a total of about $1.5 billion in 2017 which is up from 2016. This is driven by expansions related to four growth opportunities in our market access platforms,sales,Positive,Confident
"First, to support the double-digit growth of optical communications",sales,Positive,Confident

"Our repurchase activity included $2.5 billion spent on repurchases, to offset the EPS impact from the loss of the silicone's equity earnings from Dow Corning",earnings,,
"In 2017, as we did in 2016, we planned to continue repurchasing opportunistically, reflecting our view that Corning remains undervalued",,,
"For your modeling purposes, we anticipate spending approximately $2 billion over the course of the year for repurchases, or roughly what we spent in 2016, excluding the spending to offset the loss of the silicone's equity earnings",earnings,,
"Of course, the timing and amount of repurchase activities always depends on a variety of factors",,,
"In addition, we expect the Board to approve an increase of at least 10% per share in the annual dividend rate, in line with the framework",,,

Let me start on the optical question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We definitely had good growth in the fourth quarter,sales,Positive,Confident
It was higher than what we expected,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We did see the data center demand pick up in the fourth quarter,,,
It was higher than Q3 and it was also higher than last year,,,
"I think what's important to remember about data center demand is it will be lumpy, because of the project nature of the business",,,Uncertain
"But over time, we definitely expect this to be a strong driver of growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"And as we look out into next year, for our full year, we think our growth will be in the mid-teens",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"A lot of that, of course, driven by fiber of the home and carriers",,,
"But we do expect some growth in the hyperscale data -- enterprise in general, including hyperscale data centers",sales,Positive,Confident
"Now, for the first quarter, we said the growth would be greater than 25%",sales,Positive,Confident
"I think you can think about that, roughly half of that coming from the issues we had last year and half of it being the strong market that we have",,Positive,Uncertain
"Because overall, we think the market in the mid-teens gives you a sense that -- our growth in the mid-teens gives you the sense that the market, we expect to grow greater than 10%",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
I think that right now fiber supply is very tight,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Why don't I start with the telecom question, Rod",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think from an overall standpoint, we did see the growth in the fourth quarter and that was on a year-over-year basis, also versus Q3. But I think one thing that we learned in the process of talking about hyperscale growth is, because of the lumpy nature of it and the timing",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"It just doesn't make sense to think about it on a quarter in, quarter out basis",,,Uncertain
I think it's more important to think about it on an annual basis and it's part of our mid-teens or low teens growth that we expect in 2017.,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And then, Rod, on your last question on IT and screen sizes, I think at the end of the day, we don't expect it to have a big impact on the market",,,Uncertain
"We agree, I think, IT is stronger than it has been over the last couple of years",,Positive,Uncertain
"But we still think that, you know, the units themselves, relatively flat, screen size relatively flat",,,Uncertain
So we just don't see it as a big contributor,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Of course, we could be wrong about that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It may be a little bit of a positive contributor, but I think we would still end up in that range of mid-single digits in terms of the glass market",,,Uncertain
"Clearly, Gorilla Glass 5 adoption was strong in the fourth quarter",,Positive,Confident
"I'm not going to give you the percentage of what it was, but it was strong in the fourth quarter and we expect it to continue to accelerate as we go into 2017 and that's positive, both in terms of the volume itself and of the premium price",,Positive,Confident
And that premium price clearly had a positive impact on our profitability in Q4. And it will continue to have an impact on our profitability in 2017.,earnings,Positive,Confident
Sure,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think on the overall growth standpoint, it's always hard for us to know exactly the impact of the software implementation issue that we had",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"But I think if you were to adjust for that, you would still see growth in the double digits",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
And that same applies to acquisitions,acquisitions,,
The bottom line here is that we think that our position in this market and where we play in this market and the part of the market that is most important to us is growing very rapidly and we think it's seen a double-digit growth,"sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"In terms to fiber-to-the-home, clearly North America is a place where we see lots of fiber to the home growth",sales,Positive,Confident
The payment was with a customer and I'm not going to disclose what development work we were doing with that customer,,,
And I'm also not going to disclose how much it is,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But I think, you think relative to what your expectations were and the difference that explains most of it",,,Uncertain
So the answer to your second question is correct,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
That is the way that we expect it to play out,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In terms of price declines and the amount of volume we have under contract, usually as we enter into the year, we have a high percentage under contract",,,
"So 90%, I think, was important for everybody to remember, that's the way this business works",,,Uncertain
"And then relative to price declines more moderate, somewhere in the 10% range is how that would work out",,,
"I think that when we entered into our exchange contracts originally in 2014, we said they would be for three years and that we would stay at a constant rate of 99%",,,Uncertain
"We have hedged about 70% of our exposure from 2016 to 2022 at about a $1.06 rate, but we're not ready to talk about the constant rate for 2018 yet, in part because we're looking at either other opportunities for us to hedge and we're also looking at different ways that we might hedge, as opposed to the FX contracts that we're using today",,,
"So I think when we made the FX rate change previously, we did it towards the end of the year",,,Uncertain
"And I think that's probably the timing when you would expect us to talk about it again, or maybe even at the beginning of 2018.",,,Uncertain

"In mid-November, we announced the second phase of the iSeries product range of appliances known internally as the Shuttle series",products_services,,
The initial customer reaction to the announcement has been excellent,,,
And sales in Q1 have exceeded our expectations,sales,,
Initial sales of the new iSeries products are tracking slightly above the trends we have seen in previous product refresh scenarios and we believe this bodes well for fiscal 2017. Last quarter we talked about several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with service providers and the enterprise customers,"sales,products_services",,
"We gave examples of new opportunities including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic and the need to intercept, inspect and orchestrate encrypted traffic at speeds and volumes never before required",,,
"We also spoke about customers emerging desires to have consistent security policies across traditional on-premise data centers as well as private and public clouds, as the movement of application workloads to cloud architecture accelerates",,,
"We experienced many project wins last quarter, which reinforced our view of these expanding opportunities",,,
"For example, a Fortune 100 insurance company leveraged a new F5 iSeries 5000 platform to deploy the next-generation private cloud infrastructure",products_services,,
"This implementation allowed them to instantly orchestrate, provision and dismantle ADC resources and concert with our existing Cisco infrastructure",,,
This customer also deployed F5â€™s ASM product ensuring WAF functionality was available to on-premise applications as well as a private cloud data center assets,products_services,,
A Fortune 500 discount retailer with a large online and mobile clientele required an improved security perimeter for its online web presence,,,
"They also required a solution to deal with the onslaught of encrypted ECC traffic triggered by the recent adoption of this encryption method by companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft",,,
This customer deployed six VIPRION chassis in combination with a Silverline deployment and this was anti-DDoS an encrypted traffic management solution,,,
"In a 5 million plus transaction, a large Asia Pacific Telco operator initiated a 5 year program to virtualize 100% of its IP transport network and chose F5 as its primary ADC provider",,,
This deployment leveraged many cloud-based orchestration and automation technologies including OpenStack and KVM,products_services,,
"The solution consisted of F5 virtualization software licenses as well as our carrier-class firewall, our WAF and access management software modules",,,
We will be demonstrating this solution as well as many others at Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona,,,
We are continuing to experience momentum in our customersâ€™ effort to lift and shift from traditional on-premises to private and public cloud environment,,,
"This past quarter one of our long-time North American customers, a leading learning management system provider began such a transformation",,,
"Working together with AWS, F5 crafted a dynamic and secure traffic management solution utilizing F5â€™s WAF and firewall capabilities in the AWS computing environment",,,
"This enabled our customer to easily repurpose many of their legacy data center applications to the public cloud without compromising the mature security capabilities they enjoy with F5. In recent quarters, we have seen growing interest in our Internet of Things capabilities and have enjoyed successes with several Fortune 500 customers",,,
"In Q1, one of the largest global manufacturers of home appliances invested in F5â€™s VIPRION platform to help facilitate machine-to-machine communications within their massive base of install products",products_services,,
The F5 solution leveraged a full stack of traffic management and security offerings including dynamic service chains and a highly scalable SSL deployment,products_services,,
"F5â€™s leadership and scalability, programmability and diverse protocol support is ideal for managing complex IoT requirements",,,
"From a product roadmap perspective, you should expect to see F5 continue to introduce several exciting new products through fiscal 2017. Today we announced the addition of several new offerings to our security portfolio",products_services,,
"The new Herculon product family with purpose-built hardware and the simplified user experience, lets security administrators quickly deploy solutions that overcome specific application security obstacles and threats",products_services,,
Herculon products provide improved visibility and control over application behavior and solve difficult industry challenges in a straightforward easy-to-deploy manner,products_services,,
The first two offers available in the Herculon portfolio are the Herculon SSL Orchestrator and the Herculon DDoS defender,,,
The Herculon SSL Orchestrator provides improved insight for customers experiencing growth in the volume of encrypted application data,sales,Positive,Confident
Today most web traffic is now encrypted and attempts to address application security using traditional methods alone are both inadequate and costly,op_costs,,
"The Herculon SSL Orchestrator provides leading cryptographic capabilities contacts aware dynamic chaining, service chaining and native third-party integrations",products_services,,
Herculon SSL Orchestrator can significantly increase performance while significantly decreasing infrastructure costs by eliminating the need for redundant encryption and decryption capabilities,op_costs,,
The Herculon DDoS Hybrid Defender offers customers an unparalleled multilayered defense against volumetric and pervasive DDoS attacks,,,
This is accomplished by developing high performance hardware on-site and enriching its capabilities with intelligence gathered from our cloud-based Silverline scrubbing centers,,,
This hybrid approach improves time to mitigation in scenarios where website and application availability are crucial to customer interactions,,,
"The product provides comprehensive DDoS coverage through behavioral analytics, subsecond attack mitigation, and visibility into sophisticated application-layer attack",products_services,,
Also announced today is our Silverline WAF Express service as more and more of our customers prefer a web application security as a service approach to attack mitigation,products_services,,
We are introducing a preconfigured offering that leverages our cloud-based Silverline platform,products_services,,
By their very nature WAF deployments can be complicated,,,
"With WAF Express customers can protect applications with a point-and-click simplicity, while our security operation center experts monitor, analyze and mitigate attacks as they occur",op_risks,,
We also announced today that we have added security and incident response team services for all F5 customers to help them more quickly identify and neutralize threats and to help protect their critical business operations,"products_services,op_risks",,
"We plan to ship TMOS 13.0, known internally as the Daytona release, in this current quarter",,,
"Daytona is a major release with a host of new functionality, including our high-performance 40-gig virtualization; a sophisticated but easy to install iApp for our SSL Orchestrator; VCMP support for the 100-gig blade, which should extend the 100-gig blade solutions to enterprise customers; and IoT/MQTT protocol support",,,
We also plan to deliver our unique application connector solution in Q2. Our application connector enables customer applications to seamlessly access multiple public cloud infrastructures directly from private clouds in on-premise and/or co-lo data centers,,,
This provides a truly flexible and elastic hybrid cloud solution to our customers,,,
"Finally, we are planning to deliver the first release of our container micro services based solution, internally known as Project Velcro",products_services,,
"Velcro includes two products that work together, the container connector and the application services process",products_services,,
We have been beta testing Velcro in several micro services environments and we are excited by early indications that it will enable an entirely new category of F5 solutions with our new application services process,products_services,,
We believe this product will play a pivotal role in accelerating our customersâ€™ ability to adopt emerging mode two and container-based architectures in both private and public cloud environments,products_services,,
"As far as the fiscal Q2 outlook is concerned, Andy outlined our guidance for the current quarter",,,
We have made good progress in all our key strategic initiatives,,,
"The vast array of new products delivered in the second half of fiscal 2016, combined with the exciting roadmap of additional products planned for this quarter, should drive solid business for F5 during the year",products_services,,
"I believe we are poised to see increased growth in year-over-year product revenue in Q2 and we have every opportunity to build in that momentum for the second half of fiscal 2017. In conclusion, Iâ€™d like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners, and customers for their support last quarter, and with that weâ€™ll now hand the call over for Q&A","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident

But the process is actually progressing really well,,,
"Obviously weâ€™ll let you know ASAP when we get something to an own, but meanwhile my focus by a mile is focusing on the business and delivering another quarter, this quarter, another good quarter",,,

I think itâ€™s more of an additional market type opportunity,,,Uncertain
On budget â€“ budget flush is always a tough one to actually measure,,,
"I did mention that we saw a little bit of a lull, which could have been linked to the iSeries announcement, and then we saw a strong close at the quarter and some of that can be budget flush, but I wouldnâ€™t say it was â€“ it wasnâ€™t incredibly significant",,Positive,Confident

"In fact, I talked about double-digit growth, so we felt very, very good about that",sales,Positive,Confident
We expect iSeries definitely to give us more attach rate; the performance is designed to do that,,,
"Weâ€™ve taken a number of restrictions, especially towards the bottom end of the product line that should help out as well, so generally we would expect that to be the case",products_services,,
"Yes, I mean, we have become more and more positive, Paul, over the last year in particular in terms of the opportunity of the public cloud",,,
"I mean, one of the things that has been becoming very obvious, too, is when our customers â€“ remember, we have a very, very large Fortune 500 customer base â€“ when our customers are doing lifts and shifts to the public cloud, whether Azure, whether itâ€™s Amazon, et cetera, that almost 100% of the time our products are going with that and that product being, it could be classic TMOS with programmability and iRules already included",products_services,Neutral,NIL
It could be additional products like the WAF for protection or firewall or access policy management,products_services,,

So weâ€™re working in the field with the AWS folks in the field; weâ€™re doing the same with Microsoft,,,
"Weâ€™re viewing it as an opportunity, and in fact, I highlighted it as one of the three emerging opportunities thatâ€¦",,,
"And also remember the studies weâ€™ve done in terms of hybrid clouds, I mean, hybrid clouds is all over the place from the customer perspective",,,
I canâ€™t remember the exact percentage; I think it was in the 80 â€“ but itâ€™s a very high percentage of the responses we got where the large customers that we sell to are going into hybrid cloud environment,,,Uncertain
"That gives us a massive opportunity, A, to make it happen and, B, to take advantage of it as we take our security and our mature products and make sure they are on the public side of that",products_services,,

"So, first of all, let me comment on the pause and then I'll come back to your comment on marginalization","sales,earnings",,
"No, we are definitely seeing that some deals are getting pushed out as some of our customers think through their architectures",,,Uncertain
"And we have customers across the spectrum, so we have a number of customers who 9 or 12 months ago would have said, hey, we're moving everything to the cloud, and it created a significant pause in the their spend",,,
"And they've now made that decision, they've moved to the cloud and come back and their spend is actually healthier with us than it was prior to them going through the cycle",,,
"We have a number of customers and we're seeing more of them that are now going through the cycle and, as a result of that, are pushing decisions because they're revisiting their architecture decisions",,,
"In a number of cases, these are not deals that we're losing",,,
"We have visibility into these deals, we're not losing them, but they're being pushed out",,,
And that's why we're using this term that we're seeing a pause,,,
"As it relates to marginalization, to your point around do we feel F5 is being marginalized, I don't think so","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
And I think you have to parse the market a little bit,,,Uncertain
"For the customers that we have typically served and, typically, those customers have large and complex workloads, when they're moving to either private cloud environment or a combination of private cloud and public cloud, we are involved in the conversation, and we feel we have a very strong win rate and we have relevant offerings to support them",,Positive,Uncertain
So I don't feel that there's any marginalization going on with our existing customer base,"sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"There are, however, a number of applications that are being basically bought in the cloud, but created directly in the cloud that are perhaps typically less complex workloads than we have served",,,
"These are, for us, significantly new opportunities, as the world goes more digital, more and more applications",,,
"And I would say, yes, in that environment, we are not yet participating to the degree that, eventually, I would like us to participate, but that's essentially an opportunity for us to extend our addressable market that we are going to look at how we can execute against that",,,
"Brian, we're not guiding for next year",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But I would say we're pretty confident we will see product revenue growth in 2018.,"sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
"Thank you, Jim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I think there are two effects in Europe from what we're seeing",,,Uncertain
One is a bit of the uncertainty that the regulatory environment is creating,,,
"There are things like regulation around data protection and all the regulatory, specifically, in the finance vertical, that is causing folks to think about location of data centers, what their hybrid cloud environments are going to look like, et cetera",,,Uncertain
"That's the macro environment and we don't control that or how a real prediction into that other than we know that a lot of this regulation should be settled in the early parts of 2018. There are also some things that we believe have more to do with the execution of F5, so the more internal",,,
"And on those aspects, yes, we are taking actions",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We believe that, in some cases, we have probably too many people in some geographies where there's not enough opportunity and not enough people and geographies where we see growth opportunity",sales,Positive,Confident
So we are realigning our resources against the best geographies and verticals,,,
"I think as I said on the last call, because it's Europe, this typically takes a significant amount of time",,,Uncertain
It's not â€“ it doesn't happen overnight,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And we're also making sure that we're enabling our teams in Europe, both enabling and training our teams in Europe for the new opportunities that we're seeing around hybrid cloud environments, for an example",,,
"So, there are some things we're doing internally that we believe will help and contribute",,,
"And then the macro environment, we think, for the next six to nine months, we don't expect a significant improvement in the macro",,,Uncertain
"We have a pretty strong process that goes bottoms-up against pretty much every geography and vertical, and we continue to be thorough about it",,Positive,Confident
We're being a bit more cautious about EMEA this quarter,,,
"We're not expecting, as I said, any improvement in the region, and so we've factored that into our guidance",,,
But the process has been quite thorough as it had been from prior quarters,,,
"The other area that I would flag is in the federal space, there's a bit of timing uncertainty linked to the delay in the budget approval here in the U.S",,,

Our non-U.S,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"federal number isn't very large, so there'll be an element of ebbs and flows quarter-on-quarter",,,
"But, specifically, this quarter, I think that was a factor",,,Uncertain
"Rod, yeah, just a correction, what I said was that we were three quarters into the cycle not three quarters of the way through",,,
And it's typically eight quarters â€“ six to eight quarter cycle,,,
So we haven't reached the midpoint of the cycle yet,,,
We've just actually crossed the point where iSeries this quarter represented more than 50% of our appliance sales,sales,,
"In the past, we've typically seen that acceleration when we're closer to the 80% mark of our total appliance sales",sales,,
"So, to be clear, we think it's an eight-quarter cycle and we're about three quarters into it",,,Uncertain
I think if you look at how this cycle is tracking and we track that fairly closely in terms of what percentage of our total sales are with the new platform,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"It's tracking very, very closely to what we saw in the prior cycle",,,
So it looks to be taking the same shape,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"There are some differences in the â€“ obviously, in the environment",,,
"Last time we did a refresh, ACE replacement actually happened â€“ the Cisco ACE replacement happened in the similar timeframe and so that gave us an additional boost",,,

But in terms of how the cycle is tracking relative to what we've done in the past is very similar,,,
"And the other thing, Troy, is you're looking at an aggregate number",,,
"You heard me talk about Europe, and I said we're realigning resources against opportunities",,,
"When we talk about the evolution of our offering towards subscription, virtual environment, et cetera, again, that requires some alignment of resources towards these opportunities",,,

"On the first question, yes, actually, we are seeing a higher demand for best bundle than we would have in prior cycles, and that's largely because securities is important and increasingly important",,,
"One of the things that the cloud does is it dissolve the perimeter, and our solutions for security are application centric; they're not perimeter-based solution",,,
And that's actually one of the reasons we're doing well with security and seeing more and more opportunities,,,

And part of the resource shift that we talk about really relates to how we accelerate our execution organically against these opportunities,organic_expansion,,

"No, it makes sense",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I understand the question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, the reason we're saying it's tracking after prior cycle is really a key metric for iSeries is the adoption of the product in the customer base as in do our customers see good reasons to adopt this new platform and refresh their environment? And the best way for us to measure that is to look at the percentage of our total appliance sales that come from this new platform","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
"And when you look at that percentage quarter-on-quarter, we're tracking pretty much exactly with prior quarters",,,
"Now, to your second question, which was",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thank you, Andy",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"That's largely because, in the past, that has been the point at which customers have made the initial deployments of this new platform, they've done the necessary software upgrades and test and proof-of-concept, they're a bit unfamiliar with the platform and they get into the mode of more repeat purchases and that's where we typically see an acceleration",,,
That's what we have seen in the past and that's why we've looked at that 80% marker as a good indicator of the point in the cycle where we see this,,,
"As I said, again, the environment is different now than it was in the past, but if you look at these metrics we're tracking",,,
"The only thing, Jeff, that I would add is, whilst we look at the refresh cycle as a growth opportunity for F5, I think we also want to be clear that that is not solely what we see as the medium to long term growth driver for the company",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And I want to be very, very clear with that, that we see the number of applications being deployed in private and public cloud and specifically in virtual ADC market, we see that as a growth market",sales,Positive,Confident
"And a big priority for us is to make our solutions easy to consume, remove any friction there is in consuming our solutions in different environments because we believe that is going to open additional opportunities for us, specifically, in the virtual ADC space",,,
And that I see as a growth driver for the company,sales,Positive,Confident
The other important growth driver is application-centric security,sales,Positive,Confident
It is a bigger issue,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're seeing more and more attach rates to our solutions,,,
We're seeing more security stand-alone opportunities,,,
We have best-in-class web application firewall capabilities,,,
We're seeing strong demand for that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And we think, with the cloud, there's going to be even more of a need for application-centric security",,,Uncertain

We're more of an application security player,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And one of the benefits that that gives us is we have the ability to see data in the line of the application of between the user and the application,,,
"And because of the capabilities in BIG-IP in terms of scale and throughput, we also have an ability to analyze the in-line data in real-time",,,

"We are pleased with the execution in the first half of the year, which allows us to increase our full-year EPS guidance, even with the divestitures",,,
"We continue to focus on consistently improving cash flow generation, deleveraging our balance sheet, investing for growth, and returning cash to shareholders",sales,Positive,Confident
That concludes our prepared remarks,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Morning, David",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'll start and let Gary add some color,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"With regard to the leverage itself, we had talked about being in the 2.6, 2.7 range by the end of 2017, targeting getting back to around 2.5 times",debt,,
"That said, based on the refinancing activity we've done, we'll repay all our pre-payable or maturing debt by the fourth quarter, so we'll have some excess cash then",debt,,
"We certainly anticipate having some excess cash flow, significant excess cash flow, in 2018 that we could apply across a number of different ways, but we wanted to make sure we had some flexibility to do share repurchase",,,
"I think we're always looking to add strategic capabilities and expand our market capabilities, but we always do that in a disciplined way, looking at financial strategic value and relative valuation",,,Uncertain
"Right now, we think on a relative basis, we're a very good buy",,,Uncertain
So we wanted to make sure we had access to buy some of our shares back,,,
"Thanks, Dave",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, I'll hit your FX first",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As you know, our organic calculation excludes FX and it excludes the impact of acquisitions or divestitures","organic_expansion,acquisitions",,
"With regard to FX, you're right",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We had a very minor impact in the second quarter,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And right now, based on FX rates, we are modeling a very insignificant impact for the full year",,,
Neither one of those would impact organic growth in the way we calculate it,"sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"With regard to Capco, we are removing Capco from the organic base and the consulting businesses from the organic base, so they would be out of the number",organic_expansion,,
"But the 4% to 5%, again, removes any divestitures and removes any FX",,,
"Darrin, with regard to your first one, we've done some calcs, and we tried to give some color in the prepared remarks around what organic growth would look without the consulting business","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"We haven't pulled out what the impact of, specifically, of the risk-based project and some of the compares are, particularly on the EMV, because that's just ordinary business, difficult compares, and we've got to grow through it",op_risks,Negative,NIL
"But it'll certainly help both IFS and, we believe, GFS for full year in terms of organic growth","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Probably, more importantly, it helps both their margin profiles","sales,earnings",,
"IFS would be up to about a 40% margin with it and GFS would be in the 34%-type, which is a significant improvement from a few years ago from a structural improvement","sales,earnings",,
So it'll definitely help organic revenue growth,"sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"It'll help margins, but we haven't specifically carved out all the moving pieces there that you just mentioned","sales,earnings",,
"Well, we certainly think once you move compares out, the original guides that we had, which was around 3% to 6% on IFS and 3% to 8% on GFS, still hold together",,,Uncertain
"You certainly should see some improvement in acceleration in the back half of the year, particularly in the strategic segments",,,
"As you know, we were looking at about a 1 point consolidated headwind from Corporate and Other, but feel very good about the strategic segments, about the growth rates we outline, and about where they can go long-term in those sustained rates we mentioned back in May of 2016.",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Yeah, I think you've seen us do exactly that in the past",,,Uncertain
We feel very comfortable at an aggregate 2.5 times leverage,,,Uncertain
"That says we grow, right? You could even take on some debt to continue to keep that leverage at that level",debt,,
But you've seen us default to share buyback versus trying to just reduce debt lower than that,debt,,
"So you've seen us do that a number of years, then we did the SunGard acquisition",acquisitions,,
"We're getting our debt and our balance sheet back to where it needs to be, and you could certainly see us moving back into that from a default position while continuing to look at continued (32:29) opportunities",debt,,
"Thanks, Darrin",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks, Brett",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, I think it is just working capital movements",,,Uncertain
You've seen some timing around cash tax payments and some of the divestiture activity that we've had,,,
Q2 is always our lowest cash flow generation item over the last four or five years,,,
"So what we try to do is not look as much on the quarter-by-quarter cash flow generation, but look at what the total year's going to do",,,
"Through the first six months, we're at 102% and I think again we're going to be at 105% to 115%",,,Uncertain
"Some of that comes through heavier cash flow at the end of the year, with renewals and license maintenance that we've always seen in the past",,,
"So feel good about it, have good visibility into it, Brett, so",,,Uncertain
"I would tell you we feel very good about what we've laid out to the market, continue to take a conservative stance on the guide to make sure we are delivering our expectations, if not exceeding those expectations",,,Uncertain
"So it seems like every time I put a guide together, some of the broader groups tend to get a little higher than I do in terms of picking a midpoint",,,
"But that said, I feel very good about where we're at, what we've guided to and have continued to keep a conservative stance on it",,,Uncertain
Those are the two biggest chunks,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We had a convergency in Q3 of last year that we called out last year,,,
"I want to say it was around $15 million, but that's outlined in our view this year, but those are the big chunks, Brett",,,
"Thanks, George",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I'll answer your second question first with regard to it not being $0.04, only being $0.01 to $0.02. The new owners put a little bit more leverage on there in terms of what we would do, and they'll continue to invest heavier as they try to grow that top line within the consulting business",sales,,
So you're not going to see the same amount of net income that will ultimately pick up our 40% share,,,
That's the biggest delta between just picking up 40% of what we operated it at from a margin profile,"sales,earnings",,
The second would be around the discussion point around the revenue growth profile and what it looks like,sales,Positive,Confident
"So, ultimately, we think it'll flow",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It'll flow like that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, I think the tax rate itself, I think this is probably about where it needs to be, George",,,Uncertain
"We had a bit of a catch-up in Q2, which is around a higher stock-based comp, higher international profits",earnings,,
I'll caveat that with as we continue to see margin expansion outside the U.S,"sales,earnings",,
"in those lowers rate jurisdictions, we'll continue to see a lower relative tax rate than maybe some others in the business",,Neutral,Uncertain
But 30% to 31% is a pretty low effective tax rate,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
That's really the only thing in the third quarter of last year,,,
"What you've got to think about is between the consulting sale and the PS&E sale earlier this year, that's about $0.07 that was in last years' that won't be in this years'",,,Uncertain
"That's partially offset by about $0.02 of debt refi, so you've got about a $0.05 delta just through divestitures this year and the timing associated with those divestitures",debt,,
That's the biggest issue,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As you did mention, last year, we had about $0.03 in the quarter related to a conversion fee in the GFS group",,,
Thank you,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, on that, if you go back prior to the SunGard acquisition, we were in the low 20s in terms of margin profile there","sales,earnings,acquisitions",,
"We had outlined that we anticipated our international business continue to grow and gain scale and we would expand margins through that, over time, anyway","sales,earnings",,
You couple that with SunGard and the consulting exit clearly is driving incremental heavier margins,"sales,earnings",,
But I would tell you we probably got 300 to 400 basis points of underlying margin improvement before you added synergies and before you got the impact from the SunGard sale,"sales,earnings",,
"As Gary mentioned, that group is up about 1,100 basis points from that timeframe, and that is a blend between synergies, the absence of consulting longer-term, and then just ongoing scale in the existing businesses that we had, even pre-SunGard",,,
"Well, I think part of it would be around the structural improvement we've talked about",,,Uncertain
We're going to see some margin improvement because the consulting business has lower incremental margins,"sales,earnings",,
"With the removal of that, I would anticipate seeing better margin","sales,earnings",,
"And ultimately, that drives better cash flows",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So we're not updating our guide around that, feel good about the 105% to 115%, but certainly anticipate EBITDA margins to continue to improve","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"And if we do what we need to, that should improve cash flows as well Unknown Speaker And, Chris, it's Bill",,,
"(50:58) The operating teams have done a very nice job of getting very focused to help lower the DSO as well, right? So we continue to want to make sure that we're collecting our cash and as timely as possible",,,
So I don't know that that's a different aggressive stance,,,
"I just think, to Woody's point, as you see the transformation that's occurred and the continued execution on our IP-led businesses, you're naturally seeing our DSO come down",,,Uncertain
"You're seeing our free cash flow conversion trend up, and so we feel good about it",,,Uncertain
It's probably in the $0.05 range,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As you saw, the second quarter true-up was about a $0.03 benefit, so we're actually seeing that slightly lower in the back half, so about $0.05 is a good estimate there",,,
"Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call this afternoon",,,
"Upfront here, I'll plan to cover two subjects",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First, I'll comment on our Q2 results and rest of year outlook, and second, I'll provide an update on some recent developments",,,
"So, on to the quarter",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We reported very good Q2 results, generally consistent with our internal expectations",,,
"We reported revenue of $541 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $199 million, up 26%",sales,,
That's back-to-back quarters of profit growth above 25%,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
The macro overall was a nonfactor in our Q2 earnings,earnings,Neutral,NIL
"Fuel price and fuel spreads were a bit favorable, but FX interest rates and our tax rate were unfavorable versus the prior year",,,
"So, again, overall neutral macro against profits",earnings,,
"Organic growth 9%, in Q2 with Fuel Card revenue growth of 8%","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
revenue growth in our other four major product lines was double-digit; that excludes our All Other category,"sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
Same-store sales finally strengthened in Q2 to plus 1%,sales,,
We had particular strength in lodging and corporate payments,,,
"Q2 sales grew 7% versus prior year, with two of our smaller international markets, Mexico and Russia, grew sales a 100% versus last year",sales,Positive,Confident
"Q2 cash flow expanded to $125 million, up 40% versus last year and up $70 million sequentially versus Q1 2017. Q2 global customer revenue retention was 91.5%, that's nine consecutive quarters of 90%-plus retention",sales,,
"So in terms of drivers for Q2, basically three things",,,
"One, STP made a big contribution, we didn't own that last year",,,
"It grew 14% on a pro forma basis, again 9% organic growth, about $40 million flowed through into earnings","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"And lastly, we had about 1 million fewer shares outstanding",,,
I do want to point out that a few things did not go as well as we planned in Q2. The Comdata MasterCard portfolio that we converted in Q1 suffered some one-time losses in Q2 due to a bumpy IT conversion,earnings,,
"Fortunately, the U.S",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"MasterCard portfolio that we didn't convert to a new platform continued to grow quite well, up 34% in the quarter",,,
"So the one we converted, not so good; the ones that we didn't convert still growing nicely",,,
"Our Comdata trucking money movement products, eCash and Comchek, quite soft in the quarter",products_services,,
"We're moving to replace both of those with new, fresher versions",,,
And STP was just a bit delayed in some of its pricing actions as we chose to test our way in a bit more slowly,,,
"But look, all in all a good solid quarter, good profit growth, and really kind of a good first half of 2017. Okay, let me transition over to the outlook for the rest of the year","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Starting with the macro, so basically outlooking a neutral macro for the second half; FX will be better, interest rates will be worse, but on an overall basis neutral for rest of the year",,,
Operating performance should be quite similar to Q2. Things that are going well will continue to go well,,,
"The couple of soft spots, the Comdata MasterCard portfolio that we converted and the Comdata money movement products probably soft still for the second half",products_services,,
"But expected acceleration in our corporate payments business, they brought on a lot of new business that will get implemented in the second half that's been previously sold",,,
"And STP will gain on some of the pricing initiatives and some of the new channels, new sales channel initiatives in the second half",sales,,
"Speedway should be fully ramped by September heading into Q4, and we continue to roll out these PAC Pride extended network cards",,,
So this set of positives should absorb a couple of the weaker spots that we mentioned,,,
"And then finally, we're expecting a rebalancing of our portfolio here in the second half, replacing our telematics business, NexTraq, with our international payments business, Cambridge",,,
So obviously that trade should result in faster revenue growth next year,sales,Positive,Confident
So these expectations result in the following 2017 guidance adjustment,,,
We'll raise full-year 2017 cash EPS guidance $0.03 from $8.31 to $8.34 at the midpoint,,,
"So that reflects the $0.03 beat here in Q2, effectively leaving our rest of year guidance unchanged",,,
"This guidance assumes the portfolio rebalancing I mentioned, NexTraq out, Cambridge in; that will be about $0.03 unfavorable in the second half, but that will be offset by the ASR, which will be $0.03 favorable in the second half",,,
"Our second half organic growth overall should pencil out at around 8% or 9%, with slower fuel card growth in the second half, again due to that bumpy MasterCard conversion","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Okay, let me shift gears and talk about some recent developments",,,
"So first up on the capital allocation front, we announced we just refinanced our term debt facility, increasing our liquidity and extending our maturity, so we raised another $700 million in term debt â€“ favorable rates, the term A and revolver staying put at L175, the term B rate improving 25 bps to L plus 200, term A revolver maturity extended five years and the B seven years",debt,,
And that raise was oversubscribed,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We also completed our telematics NexTraq sale to Michelin for $320 million in July, so we now have that cash",,,
"So basically this new raise and sale gives us the available liquidity to close and fund Cambridge, fund a $250 million ASR, potentially do more open-market share buybacks or acquisitions going forward",acquisitions,,
And looks like it will leave our pro forma leverage ratio at year-end at under three times our target,debt,,
"On the partner relationship front, some good progress this quarter",,,
We're delighted to announce that Uber has extended their relationship with us,,,
"So, happy to continue to grow that program with them",,Positive,Confident
"Speedway, we progressed the implementation quite nicely, now 75% complete, expected to finish in September",,,
"That will lift revenues in Q4 and into next year, so that conversion going well",sales,,
"And we've also gotten closer to some decisions on some new international partner opportunities, so hopeful that a couple of things there will come to conclusion",,,
"On the acquisition front, Cambridge, expect to close Cambridge by September 1. We've now received regulatory clearance",acquisitions,,
We've received approvals and waivers/or for all the necessary state money transmitter licenses,,,
We finalized our Year One transformation integration plan and appointed one of our executives to lead the transformation effort,,,
"Cambridge is out looking 20% plus revenue growth in calendar 2017. You may have seen the SVS announcement, we have decided mutually with First Data to terminate our gift card JV",sales,Positive,Confident
"The, challenge timeline and cost associated with the regulatory process is what led us to reconsider the decision and move forward independently, retaining SVS",op_costs,,
We're in the process now of reworking our growth plan for SVS and we'll revert with those thoughts and ideas later this year,sales,Positive,Confident
"STP, hard to believe, but coming up on our one-year anniversary of that acquisition, business performing well",acquisitions,,
"Low teens revenue growth in the first half, many of our transformational initiatives now taking hold, some pricing, lower credit losses, traction on some new sales channels, and testing of a new revamped IT system","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"So, quite pleased so far with STP and its prospects",,,
"In terms of pipeline, we are still active, working some new potential acquisitions, specifically a couple attractive tuck-ins, so we'll keep you posted as we get closer there",acquisitions,,
"Let me give you an update on system conversion or migrations, we've worked on three IT conversions in the first half of 2017. Two have gone well or very well, and one has gone not so well",,,
"So on the good news front, we did convert our Comdata processing mainframe infrastructure from running in the Comdata office building to running on the IBM Cloud",,,
"This is good, it's â€“ it helps in terms of processing speeds, it'll lower our IT costs going forward and it gives us better disaster recovery if we should ever need it",op_costs,Positive,Confident
"Second conversion, I mentioned earlier Speedway, we've converted 75% of that portfolio to FleetCor systems",,,
"The conversion has gone well, quite well, and again, expect to wrap that up in Q3. On the not so good front, we converted a portion, one of our direct MasterCard portfolios off of the Comdata mainframe in Q1. We had problems converting the history or client balances",,,
"That led to several weeks of delays in billing, some errors in billing, unfortunately long wait times in customer service",products_services,,
"And as a result, we've seen a number of clients leave the program in Q2 because of those bumpy IT issues",,,
"Fortunately, we've now corrected those conversion issues, the service is running normally again, and client attrition seems to have plateaued, so we're back at trying to rebuild that portfolio",products_services,,
"So, look, in conclusion again a good Q2, good growth, 26% profit growth, back-to-back quarters of 25%-plus profit growth","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Basically, a neutral macro environment here in Q2 and previously in Q1. And overall, we're outlooking basically a neutral environment rest of the year, so glad to be off that subject",,,
"Our second half outlook is up sequentially, expecting 20% profit growth for full-year 2017. We're rebalancing the portfolio to faster growth businesses; NexTraq out, Cambridge in; we're strengthening our capital base, returning capital to shareholders, still increasing our liquidity and still maintaining a less-than-three-times leverage ratio","sales,earnings,debt",Positive,Confident
"Still on the hunt for some new partner deals, and have extended our relationship with Uber, and we feel like we're past the distractions of the first half and getting back to work, back to business",,,Uncertain
"So net-net we feel pretty well positioned to finish the rest of 2017 strong and take some of that momentum into 2018. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric",,Positive,Uncertain
Eric?,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, Ramsey",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So kind of first half, I think I said low teens, I think the second half will be closer to high teens to 20%, and I'd say we would stay at that level probably at least the first six months of next year, and then probably mid-to-high-teens",,,Uncertain
"So the short answer is, it's just more term",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"They're happy, we're happy, so they added more term to the existing deal",,Positive,Confident
"We're still trying to figure out how to take the program internationally, so that's still a work in process",,,
Thanks,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Hey, David",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Which is the direct, you're saying direct MasterCard?",,,
"Yeah, I don't have it handy",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think what we quoted is our collective set of U.S,,,Uncertain
MasterCard products,products_services,,
"I think it was a combo of the one we converted, which went a bit into the ditch, and the ones we didn't grew 34%",,,Uncertain
"I think the combination of all of those was plus 17%, the happy stuff that didn't convert and the sad stuff that converted, I think the consolidated number was 17%",,Positive,Confident
"Well again, I would say, per my comments, likely down, right? I tried to be as transparent as possible that we took a bit of a divot in this conversion",,,
"We did the conversion and it took a while to get a read on it, and basically the read of what we converted was not great",,,
"So we'll see obviously more of that as we go into kind of Q3 and Q4. So that particular portfolio will probably be flat over the next couple of quarters, and the other five or six MasterCard portfolios we would expect will continue growing at a pretty â€“ at a 20-percent-plus rate",,,
"So that's â€“ so I'd say, it's still unclear David, what the shape of that particular file that we converted, but we forecasted it to be kind of flat, the next couple of quarters",,,
"Again, as you know, it's across of a lot of places, but I'd say the Brazil thing got better, the employment piece â€“ at least the line of business we're in, the transport piece, got significantly better",,,
"The lodging piece, which I think we had on our to-do sheet (39:13) a year or so ago is in the rear-view mirror, those things are now back to positive",,,Uncertain
"The corporate payments business was quite healthy, the base",,,
"So I think it's, again, when we did this consolidated number",,,Uncertain
I think it was a point or point and half negative,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It's four or five pieces, David, moving in the right direction that brings kind of the total from minus one to plus one",,,
So it's not one thing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's literally probably four or five things that went a bit our way this quarter,,,
"When you say the large, clarify the question that â€“ when you say the large?",,,
"Let me look; I've got the sales number, I think, handy here",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"I don't have the revenue number, but I do have the sales number handy",sales,,
"sales were up about 20% combined, for the old Comdata business, fleet business, over the prior year",sales,,
"That's up 100% basically over two years ago, when we started the expansion of people",organic_expansion,,
"So that productivity is obviously getting healthy now, and obviously way up from when we bought the thing",products_services,,
"But we have completed them, David, they are complete",,,
"And I think we reiterated what we said before, that our view, management's view is we are in compliance with every law that regulates our business",,,Uncertain
Always a pleasure,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"2% to 3%, Ashish, in Q2.",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And the fuel card would have been 11% instead of 8%,,,
"So when we gave you 10% for calendar 2017, we didn't expect to have an IT divot, and it started in the second quarter, so",,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It's been a long saga for you guys as well, so I'd say that we obviously considered some other alternatives right, prior to entering into the deal with First Data, and B, we've gotten a bit smarter, we've now owned it, whatever, two-plus years",,,
So we're going to go back â€“ the guy running that's a very good guy,,,
"We're going to go back basically and dust off some of the other options and dust off his three-year growth plan, which we reviewed a bit ago, and come back to you guys, probably next call, with some clearer view of what we're going to do",sales,Positive,Confident
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, the business is performing great, sales in that line of business were up 35% in the quarter, and I think we told you they were up 50% the prior year, over the first year",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, the sales are good, and that conversion time is about 12 months to 18 months, so it's relatively easy for us to plan what the second half of next year is going to look like, because we fundamentally have sold virtually all the business as of today that will hit revenue in the second half and in 2018. And so, again, that business is trending, I think, 14% â€“ 13%, 14%, 15% this quarter, it'll step-up a bit, so it's great",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And then obviously on top of that we have the Cambridge thing that we expect to close this month, and that gives us some great cross-sale opportunity, some ripe accounts to deliver those same domestic AB (45:25) products into",products_services,Positive,Confident
So we've grown to like that business a lot,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I'd say, Bob, the goal is still in fact, in our forecast, it's either high teens or actually hitting 20% as we exit",,,
"So to your point, we're resegmenting the higher value people, and then we've got some different sales channels that will also bring in some higher value people, and then we've got a longer range plan where some of those new toll roads are expected to come on line",sales,,
"And so the business is fighting just a general malaise in the economy, and particularly in the trucking sector, which is a big part of the transaction",,,
"So that's one of the places that same-store sales are still quite soft, which is bringing the tran count down",sales,Negative,NIL
"But again, we don't â€“ today the company doesn't get paid very much from that group, so it's not as big an impact on revenue",sales,Negative,NIL
"But I'd say that we're well along on a bunch of these plans, the repricing plans, the new sales channel, the IT stuff to enable some of it, the toll road thing is legislated, so I'd say our confidence is still quite high that that's close to 20% business in the mid-term",sales,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Our â€“ we keep track of both credit losses in total and fraud as a piece of our credit losses, and fraud has declined 2016 over 2015, and this year year-to-date versus the per year",earnings,Negative,NIL
So our fraud is down,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But we've gone crazy, Bob, in terms of what we call dragnet authorization, controls basically to find, identify and shut off fraudulent stuff, because we had our own share of problems four and five years ago",,,
"So I'd say that we've worked that pretty hard, and year-to-date, I think our total fraud losses are in the $4 million, $5 million range, so it seems pretty low",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
"Oh, year-to-date â€“ annualized, call it $5 million",,,
"You can only work on so many things, so that's one we worked on, yes",,,
I have it â€“ I have it here in front of me,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, $5 million to $10 million favorable in the second half",,,
"Hey, Tien-Tsin",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I'd say in our forecast, we reported 7% global sales growth over the prior year",sales,Positive,Confident
"I would say 10% to 12% would be the number if we hadn't gotten distracted, right, calling customers back for this thing",,,
"So I would assume that that will rebound, will be double-digit growth of sales in the second half",sales,Positive,Confident
"And we haven't done all the math yet, there will be some flow-through from this one-time attrition, so one portfolio, which I think, Eric, was 3% to 4% of the global company was the file we converted? So, anyway whatever that one-time loss is, we'll see some of that trickle into Q3 and Q4, that 91.5%",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
"But again, that's in our â€“ kind of in the numbers, which I don't want to make this a depressing call talking about IT, but just to remind everybody, it clearly suggests rest of world, rest of three quarters, doing good to be able to continue to kind of beat what we set out and beat the profit number",earnings,Positive,Confident
It means kind of all the things we didn't convert are doing well,,,
"Well, Jim, always â€“ I've been wrong enough on this that it's hard to handicap again, but the update I try to provide is that the timeline to a decision that gets reported back to us has narrowed considerably",,,

"Starting with our guidance for Q1 2017. If you recall, we had an unusually strong first quarter in 2016 with 81% year-on-year growth in adjusted EPS, driven by a combination of very strong growth in Events and Consulting as well as a few non-recurring below the line benefits, such as lower stock-based compensation expense that we do not expect to repeat in Q1 2017. We expect that Q1 will be our lightest quarter of the year from both a total company and Events revenue perspective","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"Just to double click on Events, we expect Q1 2017 revenues to be proportionally similar to Q1 2016. For Consulting, we expect to see a modest year-on-year decline in revenues, when compared to the unusually strong 11% year-on-year growth from Q1 2016. Completing the primary drivers of our Q1 EPS, we expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, and 27% on a normalized basis",sales,Positive,Confident
Both lower than our projected full year tax guidance ranges due to the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to the expected timing of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards that I highlighted on last quarter's call,,,
"As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.45 and $0.48 per share in the first quarter of 2017, including approximately $0.13 per share of acquisition and integration charges in Q1. And as in past years, the fourth quarter is expected to be our largest, with more than 50% of the full year Events revenue occurring in Q4. Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange, as it relates to our reported total contract value","sales,acquisitions",Negative,Uncertain

Two things working in our favor that actually give us positive view on the outlook for Events,,,

Please note that our full year GAAP actual tax rate may also change based upon final purchase accounting,,,
"Our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards, as well as the timing of certain items",earnings,,

"The details and components of our cash flow guidance are also contained on slide 15. For free cash flow, we now expect to generate between $335 million and $365 million in 2017. Free cash flow is based on operating cash flow guidance of $315 million to $345 million, capital expenditures of $95 million to $105 million, and cash acquisition and integration payments of $115 million to $125 million",acquisitions,,
"And again, this is assuming 12 months of Gartner and nine months of CEB",,,
This also obviously has the impact of significantly higher cash acquisition charges and interest expense payments,"op_costs,acquisitions",,
It is worth noting that CEB's strongest free cash flow quarter has historically been Q1. This was true in 2017 as well,,Positive,Confident
"What you see in our combined free cash flow guidance reflects 12 months of Gartner and nine months of CEB, but excluding CEB's strongest quarter",,Positive,Confident

"And you have situations like Evanta which is a double impact, so really no revenues in Q1. But their expense base is there","sales,op_costs",,
"And then also last year, the acquisition of Evanta didn't happen until Q2. And so we've got the grow-over problem of expenses that weren't in there last year, plus the revenue doesn't really start coming in until Q2. There's also, as you can probably see from the revenue, a decline year-over-year on revenues of about $9 million, that's also flowing through","sales,op_costs,acquisitions",Negative,Dodgy

"And, Manav",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
that's why the wallet retention measure is so important because again it's putting a dollar value on those clients as opposed to the client retention where Gene's Pizza Parlor is created equal to the ExxonMobil's of this world,,,

That said, given when contracts run through or the timing of when we can reduce or eliminate certain costs may roll into 2018. So think of that more on a run rate basis or an annualized basis as opposed to all coming through in 2018. That said, we're going to do our best to harvest as much of that as possible in 2018.",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"And Jeff, just to add to that, the way we think about it is, the best way for us to drive growth and penetrate accounts is for the people who specialize in selling IT, supply chain, HR, whatever it might be, to actually go do that and talk to the HR professional, supply chain professionals, marketing professionals direct",sales,Neutral,Uncertain

We obviously can't comment on Q2. We're obviously a couple of days into May,,,

Also remember that we are booking and burning within a quarter,,,
So we may book something in January and actually start working it off in February and March,,,
"It doesn't show up in the backlog number at the end of the quarter or reduced amount, so it shows up in the backlog number at the end of the quarter or reduced amount shows up in the backlog number at the end of the quarter but we're actually working and generating revenue and profitability in the quarter","sales,earnings",,

I will come back and discuss the trends of these metrics in a few minutes as a part of my quarterly segment review,,,
We will also discuss our top-line results using both GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue,sales,,
The only difference is that adjusted revenue excludes the deferred revenue fair value adjustment that is required as a part of purchase accounting,sales,,

"In addition, we have also updated our segment guidance to reflect our new reporting structure, which incorporates the CEB acquisition",acquisitions,,
And I'll also remind you that our full year guidance includes 12 months of Gartner plus 9 months of CEB results,,,
"Starting with revenue; for 2017, we continue to expect combined company adjusted revenue of between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion",sales,,
This is comprised of the following,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"For Research, we expect combined adjusted revenues of between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion",sales,,
"For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported",sales,Positive,Confident
"For Consulting, we expect revenues of between $319 million and $334 million, which essentially reflects the shift in SaaS revenue from the Consulting segment to the Research segment",sales,,
"For Events, we expect adjusted revenues of between $328 million and $347 million",sales,,
"For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $214 million and $226 million",sales,Positive,Confident
"Again, these are adjusted revenue ranges, you will find the reconciliation of our adjusted revenue guidance ranges to GAAP revenue on slide 14 of the presentation",sales,,
"Turning to adjusted EBITDA; as mentioned, we've narrowed our expected adjusted EBITDA range for 2017, trimming the high end of our previous guidance range by $15 million",earnings,,
This modest reduction to the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by two factors,earnings,,
"First, the vast majority of our change is due to our decision to accelerate certain frontline investments in areas that will fuel CEB's growth for the future","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Given the rapid progress we have made so far with the CEB integration, we are confident of the incremental benefit this will yield going forward",,,
"The other and smaller change is to our outlook for the Evanta and Talent Assessment businesses, where we've had to focus on fortifying the structures we have acquired to set them up for future growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature","earnings,acquisitions",Negative,NIL
Slide 15 of the presentation reconciles the per share difference between our updated GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges,,,
We now expect the after-tax of these adjustments to total approximately $4.26 at the midpoint of our guidance,,,
"Putting this altogether, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.32 and $3.49 per share",,,
Slide 17 details the key assumptions below EBITDA that we've used to calculate our updated adjusted EPS outlook,earnings,,
"Given that our below-the-line assumptions are essentially unchanged, I won't take you through them in detail",,,
"For our tax rate, we continue to project an annual effective rate for GAAP of approximately 33% to 34% and for adjusted earnings of approximately 32% to 33%",earnings,,

"Finally, our EPS guidance is based on a weighted average fully-diluted share count of approximately 89.5 million to 90.5 million shares for the full year 2017. Turning to our Q3 guidance; for the third quarter of 2017, we expect GAAP EPS of between negative $0.67 and negative $0.72. This includes approximately $1.20 per share of non-GAAP adjustments, predominantly related to acquisition charges",acquisitions,,
"Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.48 and $0.52 per share for the third quarter 2017. To provide some additional color on expected seasonal trends, third quarter is typically a seasonally light events quarter from both the traditional Gartner and CEB Events perspective, followed by a seasonally-strong Q4, where we typically generate half of our annual Events revenue",sales,Positive,Confident
"In closing, we had a strong start to the year and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%",sales,Positive,Confident

"The addition of CEB further strengthens our ability to capture the best market opportunity ahead of us, as we are now able to address the mission-critical priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide",,,

"As Gene mentioned, the integration is going exceptionally well",,,

We've always had a skew that showed Q1 and Q3 as our lightest profit quarters and that's really driven by our events calendar with Q2 and Q4 being bigger event revenue quarters,"sales,earnings",,
"We've only compounded that with the CEB acquisition, where the Evanta business is predominantly a Q2 and Q4 revenue generator","sales,acquisitions",,
"And in Q1 and Q3, there's essentially no revenues but we are carrying cost related to the team that delivers those events","sales,op_costs",,

"And Gary, specifically it would be an impact probably most acutely on new business",,,
"From a retention perspective, we're working with our clients, we're making sure they're engaged and getting value and we'll continue to renew them, and as you saw, we actually saw a modest uptick in the wallet retention rate for CEB",,,

"Yeah, sure",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Hey, good morning, Tim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The way to think about it is, I think the majority of the change relates to us accelerating investments that we believe will drive great long-term value",organic_expansion,Positive,Uncertain
"So, think in the 60%, 70% of the change, balance related to some softness on TA and Evanta revenues",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And also, quite frankly, investing with the right leadership and filling out the team so that we can actually deliver over the long-term in those two businesses as well, but think roughly 60%, 70% on the acceleration investment, balance on fortifying the TA and Evanta businesses",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, Tim, I think that the way to think about it is the acceleration on the investment are some of the things that Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, so probably the biggest one related to actually starting to grow the sales force, again where CEB Research sales had been flattish, the number of head count over the last several years","sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"And so, again we always contemplated as a part of our business case that because of that market opportunity, we talked about it a little bit earlier that we would be consistently growing the CEB sales force over time",sales,,
"The reason why we've pulled forward the investment or actually the better way to articulate it is, we started the investment a little bit earlier than we had originally contemplated is that number one, integration was going really, really well and we saw the opportunity to do that",organic_expansion,,
"Number two, if we get them onboard and trained over the course of 2017, while there'll still be new sales people, who inherently have lower productivity, they will actually yield some benefit in 2018. But again, you know the cycle of how, when we hire new sales people in year one, they're less productive, in year two they're a little bit more productive and then by the year three they typically look like a fully-tenured sales person","sales,products_services",Neutral,NIL

So we'll try and focus on the key operating measures so that we can show you progress both on the traditional Gartner side and on the traditional CEB side,,,
"As Gene mentioned, we all are fully integrating across the board, and that makes pulling and parsing some of this a little bit more difficult",,,
"As we head into 2018, there are some shifts in terms of CEB had a technology business selling to CIOs and technology professionals",,,
We've already integrated that into the Gartner technology sales force,sales,,
"And we had a supply chain and marketing sales organization, and we're integrating that into the what was the traditional CEB sales force",sales,,

"That said, we'll figure out the right way to provide transparency and progress on was the traditional Gartner business maybe with a few tweaks based on those integration adjustments I mentioned and on the traditional CEB business, again with a couple of tweaks to reflect how we've actually integrated and are running the business",,Neutral,Uncertain
"And Anj, it's Craig",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think the way to think about the potential trajectory around wallet retention, they're really two primary drivers there",,,Uncertain
"Number one is what you typically think about around retention, which is making sure the clients are getting consistent value over the life of the contract and renewing year after year after year after year, and again we have best practices around how to do that and we're already as we mentioned earlier rolling out portions or all of those best practices across the way we service the CEB Research clients",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"The other way we drive wallet retention at Gartner is by further penetrating existing buying centers and existing enterprises, and with an enterprise-type licensing model, that's difficult to do",,,
And that's also one of the reasons why it's so important that we're shifting to seat-based because over the long-term that will allow us to actually further penetrate organizations as well and that will flow through into the wallet retention metric over time,,,
"Again that's not going to happen overnight, but if you think about those two levers are the way that we can get wallet retention looking and feeling like the Gartner wallet retention over time",,,Uncertain

I think same thing on the Events side,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We haven't really changed the margin profile all that much, and again we're trying to drive significant growth in both of those businesses and so I'd expect margins maybe on research to improve a little bit as we're tracking a little bit behind the 70% over time, but essentially kind of tracking where we are","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain

The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong Research results from March Q2 and across Q3 have begun converting to free cash flow",sales,Positive,Confident
"Turning to the balance sheet, relative to the approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt we had as of April 5, we have repaid around $245 million by the end of Q3 with a quarter-ending gross debt level of approximately $3.4 billion",debt,,

"And the other thing I'd add, Gary, good morning, is fundamentally the new seat-based products, because they do leverage best of both research from the traditional CEB side and from a traditional Gartner side and because they are seat-based products sold to a specific individual and then servicing a specific individual are, by their very nature, higher value products",products_services,Positive,Confident

This incremental payment will not reduce our overall cash balances as our ES pension funding requirements were less than expected by roughly the same amount,,,
"In total, we continue to expect full year fiscal year '17 free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion",,,
"Overall while this quarter presented some challenges, like Meg, I'm confident that our plan is the right long-term strategy to position the future HPE for success",,,
Now let's open it up for questions,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Sure Sherri,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So first of all, just to remind everybody, the full-year guide includes a partial year for ES and a full year for software",,,
"So, it may be easiest to start with Q2. So Q2 we ended up with an EPS of $0.35, now $0.10 of that was related to ES, which was in discontinued operations",,,
"So, when you move from Q2 to Q3, that's relatively flat and basically what you're seeing there is the impact and the pressure from the stranded costs, from the short-term dilution of the acquisitions and some of the commodity cost pressures","op_costs,acquisitions",Negative,NIL
Those are being offset by the second-half cost actions okay,op_costs,,
"And then to your point, when you go from through 3Q to 4Q, you'd see that would imply about a $0.19 improvement quarter-over-quarter and there is really three elements to that",,,
The first one is just typical seasonality,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, if you were to go look at last year's results, we saw a similar uplift in Q3 to Q4. Same thing in 2015, we would anticipate that same type of lift due to seasonality in Q4 of this year",,,
"If you just think about the software business as an example, Q4 is typically much higher than Q3. The second component of it is as we eliminate the stranded costs and as we get right size the cost envelopes around the acquisitions, that will be favorable in Q4 and then thirdly, is a $200 million to $300 million of cost out","op_costs,acquisitions",Neutral,Uncertain
"So, the way I would think about that is roughly a third of that will come in Q3 and then two thirds of that will come in Q4 and that's what's going to drive the remainder of the lift",,,Uncertain
So that's why you see that ramp up in Q4.,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We don't really give BU specific guidance on the margins, but yeah, I would say servers is driving a component of that and again the way I think about it as we talked about in the prepared remarks is there's a component of that that's structural","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"There's a component of that that's one-time cost and then you have the operational headwinds, which is primarily the commodities cost increases",op_costs,,
"Again, most of that is memory",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So that has a heavy impact on the server margin,"sales,earnings",,
Okay,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think there are a few questions in there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, let me see what I can do",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I think to your point, we did on the Q1 call, we did think that revenues would stabilize",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"We did not say that margins would stabilize and again if you're going through a quarter-over-quarter walk, to your point, stranded cost is a big element of that","sales,earnings,op_costs",,
We did not see that in Q1 obviously because we just separated the ES business in March,,,
"So, all the overhead that we were allocating to ES in Q1, a lot of that was being allocated to EG",,,
There is some FX impact,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Again, we were hedged from an FX perspective in Q1 from the prior hedges that we put on in Q4. So, there was some pressure driven by that",,,
"There was also some dilution in the acquisitions which we really didn't -- we didn't talk about in Q1, nor did we have that pressure",acquisitions,,
That gave us some pressure from an overall margin perspective,"sales,earnings",,
DRAM is causing a pressure point,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We did know about that in Q1. To your point, we talked about that",,,
"Obviously, that's why we took our guide down, but if you look at memory costs in 2Q, they're actually up another 10%",op_costs,Negative,NIL
"So, we saw a big increase in Q1 that was when we got the 40% and 50% lift, but those have continued to go up in Q2. So that drives some incremental pressure",,,
"And then from a pricing point, we did go out with global price increases, but to be honest with you, the results were mixed",,,
We saw some traction in APJ and those came in in line with what we thought they would,,,
"When you look at the Americas, we did not gain as much traction as we had anticipated, particularly in the U.S",,,
and that's driven by some very difficult competitive behaviors and challenges,,,
We saw those same types of competitive dynamics in EMEA as well,,,
"So, the overall pricing mitigation that we had talked about I'd say came in lighter than we had expected",,,
And then lastly you have typical seasonality from Q2 to Q1 or from Q1 to Q2. So that's driving a lot of the variation from quarter to quarter,,,
"Now to get to your question on product margins, yes if you look at TS, the good news with TS is it's been very stable over the years not only from a revenue perspective but also for a margin perspective","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"So, we expect that stabilization to continue as we go forward",,,
"Given the pressures that I just walked through between stranded costs, short-term dilution, DRAM pricing, yes, margins were pressured in Q2 and product margins would be negative","sales,earnings,op_costs,products_services",,
"Now as I think about how do we progress going forward and to Meg's point earlier, we think 2Q is going to be a low point and basically that's driven by the fact that one, we're going to work out the stranded costs",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"Again, those will be that zero on a run rate basis",,,
"By the time we exit Q4, we will have time to right size the cost envelopes to the appropriate levels on the Nimble and SimpliVity acquisitions and then lastly, we've got the $200 million to $300 million of cost that we've targeted to come out in the second half","op_costs,acquisitions",,
"Again, I think a third of that will come out in Q3 and two thirds of that will come out in Q4. So, as we take those cost out and the other thing that we should get is we should get a mix lift",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"As we continue to grow the higher margin businesses, HPC up 20% organically, all-flash array up 33%, Aruba up 27%","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",,
"Obviously, those parts of the portfolio carry a higher margin","sales,earnings",,
"So, we should get a margin lift going forward","sales,earnings",,
So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color,,,
"So, I'll answer the first piece and then Meg you can jump in here",,,
"From a cost perspective, the $200 million to $300 million is incremental and it is all in the second half",op_costs,,
"So, as you know, we're always looking at cost",op_costs,,
"Now we're trying to be and we continue to be very sensitive to protecting our R&D, protecting our sales costs","sales,op_costs",,
"But net-net, particularly given the spinoff and now the fact that we have 110,000 fewer people and we've had a little bit of time under our belt to operate in the new model if you will, we do think there are opportunities and there are going to be opportunities in the usual suspects",,,Uncertain
"So, if you think about just tighter spending around travel, around optimizing programs spend, around tighter policy enforcement, we think there's more work to do there and we can continue to do that, but there's also an opportunity to simplify",,,Uncertain
"So, if you think about now as a standalone or as a remain co",,,Uncertain
"if you will, you have the global structural versus the regional, versus the country",,,
"You have spanning control, you have all those types of things",,,
Those are the things that we're having better line of sight on and that's some of the cost that we will address in the second half the year and Meg do you have anything else to put on it?,op_costs,,
"As synergy comes online, as we continue to grow particularly if you think about high-performance compute and some of the areas of the portfolio, again excluding tier 1, from a year-over-year component, we would expect to return back to growth in the latter part of the year",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, I'll give it a shot and Meg you can jump in here",,,
"So again, I think our strategy is still the same",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We are going to continue to focus on organic investments because where we do that well and we do it right, it's good for customers, it's good for shareholders, it's good for partners, it's good for employees",organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
We always continue to look at share buybacks,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Obviously, we're bias toward share buybacks right now",,,
And then we're going to continue to look at M&A as long as it fulfills gaps in our strategy,acquisitions,,
"So, the way we think about M&A again as being very consistent and it's all around complementary IP, where we can leverage our distribution and drive profitable growth","sales,earnings,organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Uncertain
"So, it's all returns based",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
That a framework that's worked well for us in the last 12 to 18 months and I would expect us to continue to operate within that framework going forward,,,
"So, if you look at Remain Co",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"and again I'll take you back to Sam, we guided a $1.25 to $1.35 from an EPS perspective and we had normalized free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion",,,
"Now obviously we took that number down or we took our number down in total by $0.12 that was in Q1 that was driven by some of the FX pressures we saw, some of the commodity cost pressures we saw as well some execution issues that we were working through",op_costs,Negative,NIL
"So, as I look at those three categories, those were all primarily EG related",,,
"So, I would adjust the $1.25 to $1.35 by that $0.12 and then I would also adjust your $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion of normalized free cash flow",,,
I would take that down to roughly $2 billion of normalized free cash flow to reflect the earnings pressure,earnings,Negative,NIL
So that will give you sort of a baseline as we exit '17 of about $1.13 to $1.23 and I think there are two or three areas that are going to impact that you need to think about as we move forward,,,Uncertain
The first one is commodity cost movements and the corresponding pricing mitigation,op_costs,,
"Again, as we talked about earlier we are making traction in that we anticipate an APJ, but we're finding it very difficult in the Americas and EMEA",,,
"So, depending on how that equation plays out, that would have an impact on your baseline",,,
"From the second-half cost actions, the $200 million to $300 million that we talked about, to the extent that a piece of that is recurring, which we would expect, that would also impact your baseline going forward and then when you look at the rightsizing, the cost envelopes particularly around the acquisitions, that should provide a little bit of accretion going forward","op_costs,acquisitions",,
So that's how I would think about the baseline for Remain Co,,,Uncertain
from both a cash and EPS perspective and we will give much more guidance and clarity and visibility at SAM in October,,,
"Yes, sure",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, from a converged perspective, I think the converged part of the portfolio was down roughly 8% and traditional was down roughly 20% and then from a material perspective, really the supply constraints are much more around SSD and again as that market is very tight right now, we're getting our fair share of supplies, but given the complexity of our broad product portfolio, we're finding it challenging to what we call demand shift",products_services,Negative,Uncertain
But we would expect that to loosen up in the second half of the year particularly as 3D yields improve as well as more factories come online,,,
So that should loosen up in the second half of the year,,,
"And then from a cost structure perspective ballpark, I think roughly half of that $200 million to $300 million is more of the discretionary type stuff like policies, like travel and then the other half is labor related and within that labor piece, I'd break it out into two components",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"I think half of that is really around lowering our rehire rates, taking a look at contractor",,,Uncertain
"So, when you think about the cost to do those things, there really is no cost to do that and then there's the remaining 25% that would be more structural and that's why we're evaluating the restructuring that we have in 2018 employing forward",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"Good afternoon, everyone",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Thank you for joining us on the call,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Today I would like to cover a couple of things,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First, Iâ€™ll review the results for the quarter, then Iâ€™d like to talk about what we see ahead, how we are redesigning this company to be fit for purpose and how we are driving the innovation needed to win in the market",,,
So letâ€™s dive right in,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 performance",,,
We saw strong momentum across key segments of the portfolio,,Positive,Confident
Execution continued to improve and our profitability increased over last quarter as we reduced costs across the organization and we successfully closed the spin merge of our software business late last week,"earnings,op_costs",,
"With that milestone behind us, we are off and running",,,
"In Q3, we delivered total revenue of $8.2 billion which includes a final full quarter of revenue contribution from software",sales,,
"Future HPE, which now consists of Enterprise Group and Financial Services was $7.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year and if you remove tier-1 revenue was up 10%","sales,products_services",,
"From a profitability perspective, we made good progress on improving our operating margins as we began executing the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter","sales,earnings,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"Tim will provide more detail, but our EG margin improved sequentially to 9.3% as we work to mitigate increased commodity prices, stranded costs from divestitures and dilution from acquisitions","sales,earnings,op_costs,acquisitions",,
We expect to see even greater improvement next quarter,,,
With the strong revenue performance and improved profitability we were able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 above our previously provided outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 per share,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
Free cash flow was also strong at over $400 million in the quarter putting us in a good position to achieve our full year outlook,,Positive,Confident
"Turning to the business performance, while we have seen some improvement in the market overall, our strong Q3 performance was driven primarily by better execution and a compelling portfolio resulting in solid growth across key businesses",sales,Positive,Confident
"For example, core server revenue was up 13% year-over-year and we expect to gain share in calendar Q2. Since its launch, late last year, Synergy is experiencing very strong momentum with over 600 customers to-date",sales,Positive,Confident
As a side benefit we are also seeing an uptick in blade sales as customers move on to the path to become Synergy ready,sales,,
We are also experiencing continued strength in High Performance Compute with our combined HPE and SGI portfolio,,,
And early this summer we launched the first fully integrated HPE SimpliVity hyper converged offering,,,
Hyper converged is core to our strategy of making hybrid IT simple for our customers and we saw over 200% growth in Q3 although off a small base,sales,Positive,Confident
"All-Flash storage grew 30% year-over-year driven by Nimble, which exceeded both revenue and profit plans for the quarter","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"With Nimble and our marketing-leading 3PAR portfolio, HPE delivers a full range of superior flash storage solutions for customers across every segment",,,
We are already seeing the benefits of the combination of Nimble and HPE and we couldnâ€™t be more excited about the potential,,,
Aruba continues to perform exceptionally well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Wireless LAN solutions grew over 30% in the quarter and Aruba won approximately 70 new logos,,,
Aruba continues to take share from competitors like CISCO by introducing truly breakthrough solutions for the intelligent edge,,,
"For example, in June, Aruba announced a fundamentally new core aggregation switch called Aruba 8400. This differentiated solution has a completely redesigned operating system to support the new requirements of modern networks",,,
"It enables simplified operations for the network operator, a more powerful and scalable core to support the influx of data, faster time to remediate issues and granular visibility into whatâ€™s in the network",,,
We estimate the market for this technology is nearly $4 billion and technology services which includes Pointnext continued to perform well with Q3 revenue up 2% over last year,"sales,products_services",,
Weâ€™ve now seen five consecutive quarters of order and revenue growth in consulting as we put more emphasis on advisory and transformed services post the ES split,"sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
"To further strengthen our consulting capabilities, just this morning we announced our intent to acquire Cloud Technology Partners, a leading cloud consulting company that helps its Fortune 500 customers move to a cloud, build new cloud-based solutions and manage their cloud environment",,,
"CTPâ€™s consulting, design and operational advisory services for cloud environments will strengthen our hybrid IT consulting expertise in a fast-growing market",products_services,,
"As I mentioned earlier, while executing our business plan for the quarter, we also completed a major milestone",,,
"On Friday, we officially closed the spin-off and merger of our software business with Micro Focus on time and below budget",,,
This deal delivered approximately $9 billion in value and I am confident that this was a great move for the new Micro Focus and for HPE,,Positive,Confident
"With that transaction now behind us, we have the right strategy and the right portfolio to succeed in todayâ€™s environment",,,
"Our strategy is clear, to make hybrid IT simple, to power the intelligent edge and to provide the services to make it all happen",products_services,,
It is based on what customers are asking for today and where we see the market moving,,,
"Now as a smaller organization with fewer lines of business and clear strategic priorities, we have the opportunity to create an internal structure and operating model that is simpler, nimbler and faster",,,
"To that end, this quarter we announced a program we are calling HPE Next",,,
The goal of HPE Next is to produce an organization that is precisely built to compete and win in the marketplace,,,
"To do so, we are clean sheeting the operating model and organization structure to simplify how we work",,,
We are improving core business processes to clarify accountabilities and make the company more efficient and effective,,,
We are rightsizing the end-to-end cost structure to ensure we deliver on our financial architecture,op_costs,,
All of this will be done with a continued commitment to operational excellence and to our customers,,,
These efforts will simplify everything from how we engage with customers to how we process orders and compensate sales,sales,,
For example we are reducing the layers in our customer-facing organizations and shifting resources to the geographic markets that will drive the vast majority of our business,,,
These changes will be better for HPE and for our customers,,,
We will have much more detail on this program and the associated financial impact at our Security Analyst Meeting in October,,,
"But as discussed on previous calls, we do expect to accelerate most of the $200 million of cash payments originally planned for fiscal year 2018 into Q4 2017 to help quickly enable this program",,,
"Looking forward, we aim to offset a portion of the funding requirements associated with HPE Next through lower than expected separation costs and real estate sales enabled by the spin merge transactions completed this year","sales,op_costs",,
"For example, we recently sold our Roseville site for approximately $100 million and are now leasing back smaller offices there",,,
"Ultimately, HPE Next will produce the long-term operating and financial blueprint for our company with cost discipline built into the system",op_costs,,
"While we work to create the strong internal structure, we cannot lose sight of innovation",,Positive,Confident
Innovation is our life blood and the investments we make now will drive HPE in the future,organic_expansion,,
"Our innovation is at the core of some of the most significant technology trends in the market today like cyber security, internet of things and artificial intelligence",,,
"And today, more than ever, we are able to make focused investments in the areas where we see the most opportunity for growth in the future","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"For example, security has become a board level issue for customers across industries and market segments",,,
"In June, we announced the worldâ€™s most secured industry standard server",,,
HPE is the only company that embeds proprietary silicon-based security into its industry standard servers,,,
"This approach addresses firmware attacks, which are one of the biggest threats facing enterprises and governments today",,,
"We are also integrating the behavioral analytics based security software from our recent acquisition Niara, across Arubaâ€™s networking portfolio",acquisitions,,
"In the internet of things and in particularly the industrial internet of things, we see a tremendous opportunity as customers are looking to transform everything from retail environments to manufacturing floors",,,
"Our solutions and services capabilities are allowing customers to connect, monitor and analyze these environments, enable new customer experiences, new revenue streams and reduced cost structures","sales,op_costs,products_services",,
We are already seeing growth in our Aruba Wireless Connectivity business driven by IOT and we are seeing significant emerging interest in our highly differentiated edge compute business known as Edgeline driven by these same trends,sales,Positive,Confident
"Another example is artificial intelligence, which is transforming industries from retail to manufacturing",,,
We help our customers use AI to simplify operations and drive business outcomes in a number of ways,,,
"For example, we are incorporating Nimbleâ€™s predictive analytics technology that uses machine learning to predict and resolve performance issues across our storage portfolio",,,
Also our High Performance Compute systems provide the power that is required to crunch the massive amount of data used for AI applications,,,
"As the amount of data grows, we have a strong roadmap to memory-driven computing based on our machine research project that will exponentially extend these capabilities in the future",,Positive,Confident
"Finally, there is one commonality our customers have, itâ€™s that they live in a hybrid IT world",,,
"They run a mix of workloads in their datacenter as well as private, managed and public clouds",sales,,
Our top priority is to help them succeed in this environment and that requires a single data management plan across different environments,,,
"At Discover we unveiled our vision for our new hybrid IT stack which brings together our industry-leading one view platform with a new multi-cloud management capability as well as key software assets like Cloud Cruiser to create a truly unique, software-defined approach to hybrid IT management",,,
"This new platform will allow customers to simply manage assets across traditional IT, private cloud, managed and public clouds and optimize their right mix of hybrid IT",sales,,
We already have a number of beta customers and this platform will be widely available by the end of the year,,,
"So, overall, I am very pleased with the quarter and we now have achieved most of our significant milestones for the year",,,
"While we have more work to do, I continue to be excited about the future of HPE",,,
The markets where we play today offer tremendous opportunity and with laser focus and a world-class portfolio we are positioned to win,,,
We will have a lot more to tell you at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco,,,
"Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to quickly touch on the devastation we are seeing in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey",,,
HPE has been part of the Houston community for decades and our nearly 3400 employees are deeply rooted in that community,,,
The well-being of our employees and their families has been our top concern over the past week and we are providing support to many of them,,,
"From a business perspective, we are continuing to assess the impact",,,
But Tim will provide a bit more color on that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I want to thank our amazing team in Houston who has been working around the clock to get our office back up at running, answer customer enquiries and make sure their colleagues have the support they need",,,
So thank you to them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And with that, I will turn it over to Tim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And adding to that Toni, I think we can return to historic levels in 2018 but we are going to be probably a quarter or so delayed and weâ€™ll see what happens in commodity pricing and those other things, but I also think HPE Next will certainly help",,,Uncertain
"Yes, sure",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
There has been some press,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, listen, I thought, I was called in very late in the Uber search and I thought it was a very interesting business model to me",,,
Itâ€™s actually quite similar to Ebay in many ways,,,
"Itâ€™s very disruptive, that relies on a community of drivers just like Ebay relies on a community of sellers and the growth prospects reminded me of Ebay in its early days and as you know, I am also an investor in Uber and â€“ but, in the end that wasnâ€™t the right thing",sales,Positive,Confident
"And but I would say, that has really nothing to do with HPE which is quite special in its own right and we have a very focused strategy and a path forward to build a very big business on what I think is a quite compelling strategy, hybrid IT, edge computing, IOT and much more",,,Uncertain
And we also have a remarkable customer base and partner base,,,
"So, the other thing is I have dedicated the last six years of my life to this company and there is more work to do and I am here to help make this company successful and I am excited about the new strategy",,,
"So, lots more work to do and I actually am not going anywhere",,,
"Yes, Iâ€™ll take that and Tim can follow on",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, the results were quite a bit better in servers",,,
"Flat overall, but grew 12% to 13% excluding tier-1. And Iâ€™d say there is a couple of things going on",,,
"One is better execution, particularly in Americas, but actually across the board",,,
And I think that execution will continue and we expect as we said to gain a bit of share in the second quarter,,,Uncertain
"There was also some improvement frankly in the overall market and in all â€“ or easy compares in Q3 than they were in Q1 and Q2. But I also have to say the portfolio that we have worked hard to create that we have pivoted over the last couple of years, that is in faster growing more profitable areas in the markets is starting to kick in and you can see that in High Performance Compute, you can see it in synergies momentum that is not only, the actual product of Synergy, but itâ€™s actually accelerating the core blade business","earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"We are also seeing good traction in hyper converge that grew triple digits, albeit off a small base",,,
And then across Aruba continues to do very well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And interestingly on Aruba in the U.S,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"it reignited the wired networking business which was part of the thesis of the acquisition, but itâ€™s actually playing out very nicely in the United States",acquisitions,,
"So, listen, I mean, I think the market is going to continue to be competitive",,,Uncertain
We are going to continue to face some headwinds from Tier-1s that was down versus Q3. But we are feeling much better about that core business and you really need to think about this as stabilizing the core transactional rack and tower business while we pivot the portfolio to higher margin and higher growth segments in the marketplace and thatâ€™s working,"sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"The only thing I will say is what Iâ€™ve learnt over the last six years in this business, there is always something that could happen here, whether itâ€™s floods in Thailand, floods in Houston, I mean, this is a remarkable situation that we face in Houston I have to say",,,
"And so, I feel good about our execution",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I feel good about what we can control,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, listen a core part of our strategy is we make hybrid IT simple",,,
And what CTP does very well is very consistent with our strategy which is what customers think to do is they just with their applications and their workloads,,,Uncertain
"First, make sure that theyâ€™ve got, theyâ€™ve rationalized those workloads as fast as they â€“ and as much as they can and then decide where each of those workloads should go based on a total cost of ownership and how they want to pay for it, whether it be on a consumption based pricing model or CapEx","op_costs,organic_expansion",,
"So, thatâ€™s what this team does and we will add our expertise on on-prem private cloud",,,
Weâ€™ll add our expertise in â€“ because we do some of this today and itâ€™s an opportunity to scale that practice,,,
"But listen, there are some workloads that customers probably should move to a public cloud and you know Azure is our public cloud partner",,,
We are excited about Azureâ€™s stack on-prem,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We aim to be the leader in infrastructure behind Azure stack on-prem,,,
And so we want to make sure that we help customers find their right mix of hybrid IT and this is a nice way to scale that business for us,sales,,
"Yes, listen, we are excited now about our storage portfolio",,,
"3PAR plus Nimble, we get incremental scale, we get InfoSight which is obviously AI for the datacenter in the context of Nimble and I think one plus one here is going to equal more than two and we are really pleased, we are going to combine the R&D",,,Uncertain
We are combining the sales specialist teams,sales,,
"We are leveraging, I think the strengths of both companies to give us more scale particularly in the All-Flash segment in the market which is growing",,,Uncertain
And you will recall that only about 10% of datacenters have moved to All-Flash,,,
So there is a lot of running room there and we are a leader in that marketplace and we aim to continue that trend,,,
Let me give you a little context on that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So listen, there is obviously some short-term cost reduction that we are doing",op_costs,,
"But I have to say what we have done to the $200 million to $300 million in Q3 and Q4, I do not think itâ€™s actually hurting the business",,,Uncertain
I think we are executing better than we were before and you can see that in our results,,,Uncertain
"But as we move into HPE Next, it is a much broader initiative than sort of normal cost reduction",op_costs,,
We are essentially rearchitecting the company to be precisely built to compete and win in our markets and we are actually clean sheeting both the operating model and the organizational structure to simplify how we work and we want to take actions that optimize business processes and operations,,,
And let me just give you a couple of examples of that and this has all become very obvious as ES has moved out,,,
"When ES went to DXE on March 31, a $28 billion business on 110,000 people left this organization and it was in some way is like the tide going out",,,
You could see where there were real opportunities to improve and Iâ€™ll give you a perfect example,,,
Think about platforms and SKUs and options,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"First is, you hear about CIOs digitalizing their environment and their interactions with customers",,,
How many times have you heard a CIO saying Iâ€™ve got to digitize my environment,,,

Either they are transforming their employee environment in their campuses across the world,,,

One is security,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

They bought a company called Meridian which is way finding and GPS,,,

So that frontline sales executives can make the decisions in the field faster,sales,,
"And that by increasing the agility and the decision-making, I think actually, we will do more business",,,Uncertain
Another case on revenue acceleration is our ability to quote configurations much faster,sales,,
"Weâ€™ve made progress on this over the last several years, but we need to make more progress",,,
"And how we change our pricing and our quoting to be much more customer-focused and customer-friendly, I think is an important element for us",,,Uncertain
"If you think about reducing the number of SKUs and options, this also makes it easier to sell, and faster to configure on offering and I think that will accelerate",,,Uncertain
"And then I mentioned, probably like most companies, a small number of countries account for the vast majority of revenue and profit and will account for the growth in our industry over the next five to ten years and we want to make sure we are allocating the resources correctly to the largest countries with the countries that have the most growth and profit potential for us","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident

As you can imagine a 1% increase in the United States dwarf just about if you think of the long tail of countries that dwarfs the revenue in those long tail of countries,sales,Neutral,Uncertain

I said for many years that the next leader of HPE should come from within the company and Antonio Neri is exactly the type of leader I had in mind,,,
Antonio is a 22-year veteran of our company who began his HP career as a customer service engineer in the EMEA call center,products_services,,
"He is a computer engineer by training, has a deep technology background and is passionate about our customers, partners, employees and culture",,,
The Board unanimously agreed that Antonio should be my successor,,,
This transition is possible because of all the work we have done during the past 6 years to transform HP,,,
Many of you will recall the challenges the company faced when I became CEO and will recognize how far we have come,,,
"During the first couple of years, we focused on strengthening the company across a number of metrics",,,

We significantly improved customer satisfaction driving NPS scores from negative in some cases to an industry leading 80 for our services today,products_services,,

We also rebuilt our balance sheet paying off the nearly $12 billion of operating company net debt that existed when I joined the company,debt,,
I am proud that today HPE is exiting the year with nearly $6 billion in net cash,,,
"Most importantly, we reignited innovation and delivered groundbreaking new technology solutions",,,
"For example, we invested in the machine research project, which is focused on creating an entirely new computing architecture for the Big Data era putting memory at the core",,,
We introduced the first prototype earlier this year and have also begun incorporating certain technologies from the project into solutions available today,,,
"From a much stronger position, we then looked at our portfolio and made a number of strategic decisions to further sharpen our focus and accelerate performance",,Positive,Confident
"The first critical step was the separation into two independent Fortune 100 companies, HPE and HP Inc",,,

Next we spun off and merged our application software business with Micro Focus creating the seventh largest pure-play software company in the world,,,
The ES and software transactions delivered more than $20 billion in value for HPE and our shareholders,,,
"We also made a number of smaller divestitures, including Tipping Point and Mphasis and we divested 51% of our China business to Tsinghua Holdings creating New H3C Group, the leading Chinese provider of technology infrastructure",acquisitions,,
This unique approach has put us in a strong position to capitalize on the second largest IT market in the world,,Positive,Confident
We also made a number of strategic additions to strengthen our portfolio in key growth areas,sales,Positive,Confident

"And next week at Discover Madrid, we will officially introduce Project New Stack",,,
"New Stack is all about what our customers want most, simplicity and control",,,
"Itâ€™s a hybrid IT management platform that lets you deploy, operate and optimize public cloud and on-prem private cloud environments through a simple and unified experience and it will accelerate app development and deployment with integrated DevOps capabilities",,,

"This was an enormous conglomerate and you would go in front of customers heâ€™d be talking PCs Superdome Integrity X servers, Enterprise Services, Software and they werenâ€™t sure what we stood for and it was just way too broad and we were not executing with the right R&D against any of those segments",products_services,,
So now HPE is more relevant they know what we stand for and the core value proposition is the software defined data center on-prem with public cloud like economics,,,
"This whole moved to flexible capacity and a pay-per-use model is actually encouraging people to say, do I need to move every workload to the public cloud",,,
"And then our new stack offering, our new stack announcement discovered next week, I think itâ€™s going to be a milestone and a cap stone in some ways to the innovation and agenda thatâ€™s weâ€™ve driven over the last 6 years",,,Uncertain
"So Iâ€™d say that those are the main things, I would also say the speed at which we move this company was a slower company then I would have like to seen 6 years ago, and now we jump on opportunities on problems itâ€™s far more nimble, far more agile and I think you frankly just a better run company than it was 6 years ago",,,Uncertain
"And I think you mentioned that but just itâ€™s important to note that the number of these acquisitions when we acquired them, were actually losing money and so we have now worked that of and I think virtually all of them will be accretive in 2018.",acquisitions,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, we canâ€™t",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I donâ€™t think we will quantify that on this call,,,Uncertain
What I would say is I think the sales team is hitting the ground running on storage,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
Phil Davis who is our new Head of sales comes from a storage background,sales,,
"So, I think you will naturally see him pivot harder to storage than perhaps some of our earlier sales leaders",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
And so I think you will see improvement in the U.S,,,Uncertain
"And by way, we did very well in EMEA, very well in APJ",,,
"So, I think you will see an improvement in the U.S",,,Uncertain
"So, first of all, I am going to work with Antonio through the transition at the end of January and then I will be a very active board member",,,
"And actually after a 35 year nonstop career, I have actually come to take a little downtime, but there is no chance, I am going to a competitor, no chance",,,
"Listen I have to say I become quite loyal to Hewlett-Packard and to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, I love this company and I would never go to a competitor",,,
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, listen I think the storage business is benefiting from the explosion of data and we are seeing that every single day",,,Uncertain
We are also benefiting by storage becoming embedded in server architecture,,,
InfoSight I think is going to be a major game changer for our storage business is part of the reason that Nimble is growing at 80% is because itâ€™s AI for the storage arrays in a way that does predictive analytics and predictive maintenance,,,Uncertain
"With regard to acquisitions, you know what, when I came to this company I think we had a somewhat less than stellar reputation on acquisitions",acquisitions,Neutral,Uncertain
"And I think the acquisition profile that had been successful for us whether itâ€™s Aruba or SimpliVity, etcetera is the following",acquisitions,Neutral,Uncertain
"Is there a complementary technology to one that we already own that can benefit by being â€“ by leveraging our distribution channels, listen Aruba has accelerated its growth rate under HP, because we can introduce the Aruba product line to customers",products_services,Positive,Confident
"They had no way to get into before and also customers tell me everyday that they buy Aruba, because itâ€™s not a standalone small startup company, itâ€™s backed by big HP from a service perspective, from a warranty perspective etcetera",products_services,,
"So, those are the kind of acquisitions that we look at",acquisitions,,
"So, if we found something that we thought was important in the storage business that benefited from our distribution channel and we saw a good business case and it was priced right, we might think about doing it",,,Uncertain
"But I think you have seen Tim and I would be very disciplined about acquisitions, returns based by the company right and have a very clear business case, whether itâ€™s cost take-out or acceleration","op_costs,acquisitions",Neutral,Uncertain

And I will be on the board to make sure they do,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yes, so you are right",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Aruba, both wired and wireless, has had a really great fiscal year â€˜17. And the thesis when we bought Aruba was the wireless would actually drag along the wired and that has actually turned out to be the case, particularly in the United States, where the wired portfolio had a great â€˜17 in a particularly strong Q4. Increasingly, we see demand for Aruba on a flexible capacity model",,Positive,Confident
"And just like any other product that we sell, we are happy to do a flexible capacity model pay-as-you-go, annuity-based revenue stream for people who want to buy that way for Aruba","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
We also I think are benefiting from the Gartner Magic Quadrant that I referred to or Tim referred to in the script where we are for the first time a leader in networking in the vision category and itâ€™s been â€“ this is the first time in three decades that Cisco has not owned that top spot and we can feel the momentum in the marketplace,,,Uncertain
"So, listen a number of our competitors are talking about a clone of flex capacity, would we dig into it, it is actually not the same thing as we are offering, itâ€™s not entwined with services and itâ€™s not â€“ itâ€™s really just sort of glorified leasing model and thatâ€™s different from what we are offering",products_services,,

"Thank you, Diana",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today",,,
Let me start by saying I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter,,,
"As a more nimble company, we've been able to accelerate our strategy, and we're now firing on all cylinders",,,
"With a strong start to our 2017 fiscal year, we continued to build on our track record of delivering on all of our financial commitments with discipline, focus, and execution",,Positive,Confident
"We've also made solid progress in positioning the business for long-term growth, and we accomplished this amidst a market backdrop that remained highly competitive",sales,Positive,Confident
Let me take a moment to share the notable highlights for the quarter,,,
"We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38, at the high end of our outlook range",earnings,,
"We exceeded free cash flow expectations, delivering more than $700 million and returning more than $600 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends",,,
"And we grew net revenue by 4% year over year to $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in Personal Systems",sales,Positive,Confident
"We are delivering strong results because we are executing on our reinvention and driving our strategy to protect our core, prioritize growth, and invest in the future",sales,Positive,Confident
We are doing this with a relentless focus on innovation and engineering technologies that consistently amaze our partners and customers,,,
"A perfect demonstration of this is in Personal Systems, where yet again for the third consecutive quarter the team delivered exceptional results",,,
"This is a story of innovation and execution in delivering revenue, margin expansion, and market share growth year-over-year","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
Personal Systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year with operating profit improvement,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"The last time we saw this level of revenue growth was in 2014, triggered by the XP refresh cycle",sales,Positive,Confident
"In contrast, this growth was triggered by HP's innovation engine and ability to outperform the market",sales,Positive,Confident
I'm particularly pleased with the balanced results in Personal Systems across geographies and product segments,products_services,Positive,Confident
We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all three regions as well as in notebooks and workstations,sales,Positive,Confident
Our focus on segmenting the market opportunities and addressing strategic pockets of growth with differentiated products has resulted in profitable share gains in both consumer and commercial,"earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"In calendar quarter four, we beat the PC market unit growth by 8.5 points, outperforming all key competitors and achieving our highest ever worldwide market share position of 21.8%",sales,Positive,Confident
Our focus is to bring customer value and innovation to market,,,
"And because of this, we have been rewarded with share gains",,,
This is the way we like to win,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Without a doubt, our momentum can be attributed to the strongest portfolio in our history",,Positive,Confident
"At the Consumer Electronics Show last month, once again we took home nearly two dozen awards for products like the EliteBook x360, the world's thinnest business convertible notebook, and the ENVY Curved All-in-One desktop, the world's most immersive at 34 inches",products_services,,
And one key point of differentiation is security,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We worked very hard to ensure that HP's PCs and printers are the world's most secure and manageable,,,
"Last week at RSA, we announced HP Sure Click, the world's only integrated browsing solution that protects HP devices from the number one attack vector, which is malware",,,
The supplements our best-in-class security stack and is part of our HP Secure promise to customers,,,
"If you ask Ron Coughlin, HP's President of Personal Systems, about the magic within the business, he would tell you that we are continuously changing the way we create and deliver computing experiences that amaze",,,
It is based on a unique understanding of the market and direct collaboration with our customers and partners,,,
Several large wins this quarter resulted from these deep partnerships,,,
"Corning, a leading innovator in material sciences, and Roche, one of the largest biotech companies in the world, both depend on HP to deliver a comprehensive package for everything from desktops to workstations to notebooks",,,
"Now turning to Printing, we made great progress in stabilizing the business",,Positive,Confident
"Hardware revenue grew year over year in constant currency with units up 6%, bolstered by our new Sprocket product that is helping create a new category in mobile printing","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
"The overall market was a bit better than expected, with slight unit growth year-over-year in calendar quarter four",sales,Positive,Confident
"Due to our hard work taking cost out, we were well positioned to take advantage of this market upside and placed more positive NPV units",op_costs,Positive,Confident
"Our installed base mix quality continued to improve, supported by share gains in value multi-function printers for the 19th consecutive quarter",sales,,
"We continued to deliver highly secure and innovative printing solutions for our customers and partners and had several significant wins, including one of our biggest ever with one of the world's largest providers of technology solutions to the automotive industry",,,
"And they are leveraging HP products, including the world's most secure LaserJet hardware, Care Packs, and supplies",products_services,,
"We also saw momentum in strategic contractual areas, with strong results in Managed Print Services and continued good momentum in Instant Ink enrollment",products_services,Positive,Confident
"You'll recall one of our key growth initiatives in Printing is Graphics, which delivered strong performance once again, with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency for the 14th consecutive quarter",sales,Positive,Confident
"We saw strong hardware growth in Indigo, large-format industrial, and PageWide XL, as well as growth in Graphics supplies and services",products_services,Positive,Confident
"Among the many strong custom deployments is LSC Communications, a global leader in print services, who is deploying our PageWide web press to support its growing client demand, having more than 3 billion pages of capacity in its printing platform",products_services,Positive,Confident
"With our continued progress this quarter, we remain confident that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of fiscal 2017. Consistent with that, total supplies revenue was down just 2% year-over-year in constant currency",sales,Positive,Confident
"As we always say, it's all about supplies, and we continued to drive a number of initiatives within the Four Box Model to return this revenue stream to growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"Also in Printing, we're on track with the acquisition of Samsung's printing business that will help to accelerate our A3 portfolio",acquisitions,,
"We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions",,,
"Turning to 3D Printing, this was a milestone quarter, with our first unit shipments and revenue recognition",sales,,
"Customers such as Jabil, Materialise, and Shapeways have received installations, and we are tracking to our strategy to disrupt the $12 trillion traditional manufacturing market",,,
"According to Jabil, Multi Jet Fusion is one of the few technologies capable of delivering production-grade parts with cost-effective efficiency","op_costs,products_services",,
"And according to them, some of their own end customers have said they couldn't believe 3D Printing could produce that kind of quality",,,
"Overall, quarter one was a quarter of innovation and solid execution",,,
"I'm proud of the results we were able to deliver, but we're never satisfied",,,
"We see plenty of momentum, innovation, and opportunity for us to capture in both the near and long-term and are aggressively pursuing profitable share and targeting strategic growth segments","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"We're continuing to accelerate and deliver for our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders",,,
And I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments going forward,,,
"Again, fantastic quarter across all of our business segments",,,
"And now, I'll turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our financial outlook",,,
"Thanks, Katy",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me tackle it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Listen, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we remain confident that supplies revenue growth in constant currency will stabilize by the end of 2017, consistent with our Four Box Model analytics that we see",sales,Positive,Confident
"Actual performance continues to meet and it sometimes beat the Four Box Model forecast, which means that we firmly believe that the strategy that we're executing to is the right strategy and that you've seen those metrics play out inside the business results",,,
So it gives us increased confidence as we head towards the end of 2017 that we'll stabilize in constant currency,,,
And that's what we said we would do,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The market was a little higher than the analysts had predicted, and we took advantage of that with that lower cost structure that Cathie is talking about",op_costs,,
And then you're seeing that show up in the units at positive 6% versus last year negative 16%,,,
It's like a 22-point spread there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Okay, I'll start, and then I'm sure Cathie will no doubt chime in here",,,
"I think Cathie answered the question on Print pretty substantially, so I'm not sure that there's much additional information to add there",,,Uncertain
We obviously invested in marketing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We invested in units, and there was some currency",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We also had currency in Personal Systems, but we were also facing fairly competitive or increased prices for components",,,
"And that was a headwind to the quarter, which we overcame by effectively growing out of the problem because our cost structure was much more in line with where we needed it to be from a competitive situation",op_costs,,
"The innovation portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, more than 23 awards that we won at CES",,Positive,Confident
"We were leaning into that innovation, from a customer's perspective, a lot of demand for our products",products_services,,
"So even against that cost headwind from a component level perspective, we were able to substantially improve our performance from a top line perspective","sales,op_costs",,
And you saw obviously Personal Systems up 10% year over year as reported or 11% in constant-currency,,,
And that makes all sorts of sense from our perspective because we're trying to look always through the lens of a customer,,,
"And a customer-centric approach means that we try to develop technologies that make sense for a customer, whether they happen to be laser or ink-based or whatever else we have in our kit bag as opposed to being driven by technology lines, and that's why we made that alignment change",,,
"Okay, great",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think it's always helpful to answer this question in two parts,,,Uncertain
"There's the short-term view of the market, and I'll get Cathie to tackle that, and then I'll give you a long-term view of how we see the PC market, and then we'll close out with the rest of your question",,,
"And more broadly speaking, if I helicopter up a little bit, I don't think our views have fundamentally changed on this business",,,Uncertain
I always like to remind everyone; it's a $333 billion market,,,
It's very competitive and it continues to consolidate,,,
"So when we take share faster than our competitors three quarters in a row and we're executing the way we're executing but not taking share for share's sake, which we're committed to not doing, what we end up with is a business that's firing on all cylinders",,,
"More broadly, we think it's all about innovation",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And as I mentioned in my initial remarks, the growth that we saw in the PC business wasn't as a result of one event",sales,Positive,Confident
It wasn't like an XP refresh cycle,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It was off the back of really strong innovation right across the portfolio, the values that the customer sees and the little sprinkles of magic that Ron and the team are adding to the product portfolio",products_services,Positive,Confident
We have to be excellent in the core,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We have to continue to search for those pockets of growth as we segment the market, like commercial mobility, create categories like Sprout and x3. All of it has to be anchored in megatrends that we see changing in the market",sales,Positive,Confident
Services and solutions make a big part of that $333 billion market,products_services,,
About half the market is not the core of what you think about as desktops and notebooks,,,Uncertain
It's a lot of services and solutions and attach and other devices and workstations and thin clients,products_services,,
"There are megatrends around consumer and commercial, this OneLife, millennials, mobility and security",,,
"So doing that segmentation, operating, continuing to take costs out of the system means that we're playing our own game and we're being rewarded for it",op_costs,,
"The reception has been broadly positive on a number of dimensions, firstly off the back of our own home-grown innovation with the PageWide array and the ability to take that into the A3 line of products",products_services,Positive,Confident
"But in addition to that, obviously the line that we're initially OEM-ing from Samsung but then once we complete the Samsung acquisition by the end of this year, we'll round out the portfolio",acquisitions,,
"So I think across the globe, a lot of very detailed plans at a partner level, down at a customer level",,,Uncertain
"I spend personal time all around the world working with the teams on the go-to-market strategy, which is every bit as important as having a fantastic product portfolio",products_services,,
"And then we marry that together with the marketing work that Antonio [Lucio] and his team are driving, some terrific new marketing campaigns anchored around security, which is really resonating with our Customer Advisory Council and other customers and partners",,,
"You put all that together, we're really looking forward to the launch of these products, which as you mentioned, is coming up pretty quickly here",products_services,,
"Look, when we think about Personal Systems commodities, there's really three commodities that are under pressure",,,Uncertain
"It's memory, which includes random access memory as well as SDD (sic) [SSD]",,,
"In addition to that, there's batteries and LCDs",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And we take a very long-term approach with our supplier base,,,
We have long-term agreements with many of them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We do seek to leverage the balance sheet wherever it makes sense economically for us to do that,,,
How long will this last? It's a little bit difficult to completely forecast that,,,
"But I would say from previous experience, it takes a long time to change factory output levels",,,
"And, for example, what's affecting memory at the moment is the doubling in density across most of the mobile phone market because the mobile phones are selling many more in absolute units, but the fact that they all doubled their density puts pressure on that memory market",,,
"So if you want to really adjust that, what you have to do is add capacity, and we're talking about billions of dollars of investments from the memory manufacturers",organic_expansion,,
That doesn't happen overnight,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So these cycles can often last quite some time and it varies by commodity, but that should be the way you should be thinking about it",,,Uncertain
"Again, looking through the eyes of a customer, it increases customer satisfaction when there's not enormous price volatility in the market that encourages gray imports and all of the issues associated with that and the frustrations associated with that",,,
So we've seen the gray marketing activity significantly reduced,,,
"We're seeing much more stable prices in the market, which is a benefit for our customers, channel partners, and our business performance",,,
We're confident in stabilizing supplies by the end of 2017.,,,
Thanks,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And in addition to that, it would be the full execution of our strategy, not only in the core, but as well as the growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"There's A3. Think about that $55 billion market where we have less than a 4% market share today, continuing our ramp of Graphics and commercial mobility, and we've only just begun on 3D Printing where we placed those first units and revenue recced them, which is even more exciting",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And the fact that our customers are telling us that the printers are performing as per our promise on speed, quality, and cost is really important",op_costs,,
And that strategy is anchored in time horizons,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The core is the here and now,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Growth is the next two to three years, and future is the 3 to 10-year timeframe, and that's how we think about this business",,,Uncertain
I thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules to tune in today,,,
I think this quarter can best be characterized as relentless execution and innovation that delivered really strong results,,Positive,Uncertain
"It's a consecutive quarter of growth, so this is the second quarter in a row of growth and solid performance",sales,Positive,Confident
Innovation is at the heart of driving the meaningful share gains that we had,,,
"We're the pillar of stability right now in the industry, whether it's on the security dimension or innovation dimension, regardless of the market conditions",,,
"We have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on the commitments that we laid out at the security analyst meeting, and I remain convinced, as does the rest of our entire organization, that our most innovative days lie ahead of us",,,

"We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, at the high end of our outlook range",earnings,,
"We grew net revenue by 7% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, driven by growth in Personal Systems and Print â€“ the first time weâ€™ve delivered growth in both segments during the same quarter since Q4 2010. We delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the first half of the fiscal year",sales,Positive,Confident
"Through the same year-to-date time period, weâ€™ve returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends",,,
"Looking at the business segment performance, Personal Systems continued to deliver and demonstrate how playing our game drives strong results",,Positive,Confident
The team once again drove revenue growth year-over-year and market share expansion,sales,Positive,Confident
We saw a small increase in operating profit dollar year-over-year at a time when significant component costs headwinds have pervasive across the industry,"earnings,op_costs",,
"This is a great example of how segmenting market opportunities, innovating and executing can yield amazing results",,Positive,Confident
"For the second consecutive quarter, Personal Systems revenue grew by 10% year-over-year",sales,Positive,Confident

"In calendar quarter one, we beat the year-over-year PC market unit growth by 12 points, once again outperforming all key competitors and the market as a whole",sales,Positive,Confident
We achieved 21.7% global market share and regained the number one PC market position globally,,,
"Remember, the market share leadership is an outcome, not an objective",,,
Our ability to gain profitable share is one of the true measures of success,earnings,Positive,Confident
"Today, security is top of mind for consumers and the boardroom alike",,,
Just look at the cybersecurity events over the past couple of weeks,,,
"With this backdrop, we continue to deliver the most secure and manageable PCs in the world, with powerful new commercial notebooks and desktops, including EliteBook x360 with HP Sure View and HP Sure Click",,,
"As part of our world-class security stack, Sure View defends customers from visual hacking, with a built-in electronic privacy screen",,,
"HP Sure Click protects customers and organizations from Web-based security threats, including malware and other viruses that we are all seeing daily in the news",,,

"Now, moving to Q3 supplies performance",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
revenue of $3.1 billion was up 10% year-over-year and represented 66% of print revenue,sales,,
"The supplies growth was better than anticipated, driven by improving four-box model drivers",sales,Positive,Confident
"As we described in the past, the way we look at supplies revenue growth operationally is to take our as-reported number and adjust for two things",sales,Positive,Confident
"First, we look at constant currency growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"In Q3, currency represented less than a point of delta, so supplies grew 10% year-over-year in constant currency",,,
"Second, we adjust for changes made in the second half of last year to our supply sales model",sales,,
"In Q3 2016, reported supplies revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $225 million or eight points of growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"Therefore, when you deduct the eight points against the 10% constant currency growth, net adjusted supplies growth for Q3 2017 was 2% year-over-year",sales,Positive,Confident
We are very pleased to have achieved supply stabilization a quarter earlier than expected,,,
"We also expect to consistently operate with supplies channel inventory levels, remaining at or below our ceiling",,,
"And in Q3, channel inventory levels were below the ceiling",,,
"As a reminder, as part of making the supply sales model changes last year, we lowered our channel inventory ceiling to better reflect the more demand-driven sales model",sales,,
"Looking forward to Q4 2017, we expect that our year-over-year supplies revenue growth will remain flat to slightly up when making similar operational adjustments for currency and then backing out approximately $225 million for the supply sales model channel inventory adjustment taken in Q4 of 2016. Print operating profit was 17.3% in the quarter, down 3.1 points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially","sales,earnings",Negative,Uncertain
The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the one-time adjustments I mentioned earlier,,,
"The positive margin impact of deducting certain marketing optimization software asset, offset by the negative impact of changing the supply sales model, plus productivity improvements year-over-year","sales,earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"Excluding the one-time adjustments, we saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year","earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Sequentially, the 10-basis point decline is consistent with normal seasonality",,,
"Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in Q3 and approximately $3 billion year-to-date,,,
Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and approximately $2.8 billion year-to-date,,,
"Cash conversion cycle was minus 35 days, a five-day sequential improvement, driven by an eight-day increase in days payable outstanding, offset by a one-day increase in days of inventory and two-day increase in days sales outstanding",sales,,
"The strong Q3 results were driven by Personal Systems revenue performance, which grew sequentially by over $700 million or 10%, well above historical norms",sales,Positive,Confident
This incremental volume materially helped near-term working capital including days payable,,,
"As you know, since Personal Systems has a negative cash conversion cycle, the timing of cash flow is impacted either positively or negatively depending on its sequential revenue performance",sales,Positive,Confident
"Also, we saw positive business linearity in purchasing and other receivables, which supported improved timing of cash flows by couple of hundred million dollars",,,
Year-to-date cash flow is now ahead of our full-year range provided during last year's security analyst meeting,,,
We are now targeting a higher revised full-year free cash flow outlook of at least $3 billion,,,
"This assumes a cash conversion cycle down sequentially, more-than-normal seasonality, and more in line with the first half performance",,,
"Finally, we expect higher fourth-quarter capital expenditures, but will not exceed our full-year CapEx guidance of $500 million",organic_expansion,,
"During the quarter, we had a total capital return of $524 million through share repurchases and cash dividends",,,
"Year-to-date, we have returned 56% of free cash flow as compared to our full-year target of 50% to 75%",,,
"For the full year, we still expect to deliver returns towards the higher end of the range",,,
"Looking ahead, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook",,,
"For the full year, we are on track to deliver our productivity initiatives as announced at SAM",products_services,,
"In Personal System, we expect to see continued increases in cost of components in Q4. We expect to offset these headwinds with increased pricing, which could have a more significant impact on demand and operating margins than we've assumed","sales,earnings,op_costs",,
"With this demand uncertainty, combined with our very strong Q3 revenue performance, we expect Personal Systems Q4 revenue to grow less than normal sequential seasonality",sales,Positive,Confident
"For Printing, we expect supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in Q4 in constant currency and adjusted for last year's supply sales model change",sales,,
We also expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV,,,
"Given our hedging strategy, we have rolling currency hedges, which extend into future quarters and, therefore, we do not expect a material tailwind from currency in Q4 2017. We will also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so",op_risks,Neutral,Uncertain
"With all that in mind, Q4 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the range of $0.42 to $0.45. Q4 2017 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. We are raising the midpoint of our full-year fiscal 2017 non-GAAP and GAAP EPS",earnings,,
"Full-year fiscal 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.66 and full-year fiscal 17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.50. With that, let's open it up for questions",earnings,,

"And, Sherri, we'll talk more about FY 2018 specifically at our security analyst meeting in October",,,
"So, everyone should join us then",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, from a growth perspective â€“ first off, it's a little bit tougher compare, right? So, if you actually look at what's happened to unit growth, kind of each of the quarters this year, each quarter, the previous year is a bit tougher",sales,Positive,Confident
"So, I think that's part of what's going on",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And then the other part is that we are very much focused on high-value units,,,
"As we've talked about before, all units are not created equal in the market",,,
And where we want to focus all of our energy is really on positive NPV and those typically are really the high usage categories,,,
That's where we want to grow and where we want to gain share,,,
I don't think there is necessarily a normalized free cash flow,,,Uncertain
One of the things that you saw in the strength of our free cash flow this quarter was the business mix impact,sales,,
"So, Personal Systems grows $700 million in revenue sequentially or 10%, well above normal sequential, you're going to see a big increase in accounts payable, as you saw and a lot of free cash flow",sales,,
"So, the concept of normalized free cash flow is really not one that I can really comment on directly",,,
"Sure, Katy",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, it's that it'll grow less quickly than what is typical seasonality, not that it'll decline",,,
We do expect it will grow sequentially,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then in terms of price sensitivity, we see the greatest impact in the commercial space",,,
Consumer price increases have taken hold and we continue to perform very well in the consumer space,,,
"I think consumer revenue was up 14% year-over-year, even though we have done price increases",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, itâ€™s much more in the commercial space",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And our view is that, as we mentioned on the Q2 call that it would take a quarter for them to kind of catch up and we did see some of that in Q3. Hence, some of the sequential improvement in operating profit for Personal Systems",earnings,,
Dion mentioned that we had 6% share,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"That is up both year-over-year and sequentially, a point or a little over a point",,,
"So, that's one of the metrics you can absolutely see externally and track as we make progress here",,,
"So, Jim, let me take the second one first",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Just to make sure that we're all communicating well, what I said was that our business in Personal Systems would grow slower than normal seasonality for our business",,,
We have been outgrowing the market by quite a bit,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I don't expect that we will lose share even though our revenue will be a little bit behind normal seasonality",sales,,
"So, Toni, we'll talk a lot more about 2018, obviously, at the security analyst meeting in October",,,
But I think one of the things that needs to be brought into that analysis is what's going to happen in the market from a pricing perspective,,,Uncertain
We've now seen in fiscal 2017 pretty significant price increases,,,
"And so, if there is a tailwind from currency in 2018, our expectation is that prices are going to have to come down pretty significantly to relieve some of the pressure that's building because we've been increasing prices this year",op_risks,Negative,Uncertain
"And so, then it's going to be, ultimately, what is the total impact, it's going to be how many price declines do you have to do and what impact does that have on both revenue and EPS",sales,Negative,NIL
"So, first, on the Samsung part of your question, Toni, we don't expect that Samsung is going to close until calendar Q4. So, we do not expect that in our fiscal Q4. And so, I think that's important",,,Uncertain
It will be â€“ Q4 will be without Samsung,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then, in terms of kind of the puts and takes of the sequential view, probably, the two biggest things to call out",,,
First is commodity costs,op_costs,,
We do expect commodity costs to go up sequentially,op_costs,,
"And so, that'll be a bit of a headwind",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But probably the bigger impact is just the opportunity that we see to place more positive NPV units,,,
"And so, that's really what is kind of the biggest impact sequentially on EPS â€“ Iâ€™m sorry, relative to normal seasonality",,,
"So, Shannon, I think it's a bit difficult",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We don't break out kind of that level of detail,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"What we have talked about is, obviously, our commercial business is bigger because of the usage than our consumer business",,,
"And, therefore, you'll see a difference in toner and ink as a result of that",,,
"Although, just to be clear, some of the consumer now has our low-end laser in it",,,
"So, when we talk about our home print system, it includes low-end laser",,,
"But, ultimately, what's going to drive the supplies is really the four-box model divers",,,
"It's not ink or toner, it's really about driving across the four boxes, focusing on placing the right units, the high-quality units, working on your installed base, working on, obviously, our market share â€“ our aftermarket market share, as well as the pricing related to supplies",,,
"So, I'm not aware of other views that say it's going to be flat",,,
"We actually think it's going to continue to go up, but at a slower rate",,,Uncertain
This is particularly true from a DRAM perspective,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then when you step back and you look at it kind of Q4 versus Q3, in the course of Q3, the commodity prices continue to go up",,,
"So, of course, that will represent a headwind for us in Q4, but we do expect some additional increases in commodities in Q4 as well",,,
"And then the other thing that I would add is that, I was asked to make a relative comment, and we saw consumer revenue this year â€“ this quarter grow 14% year-over-year and commercial 11%",sales,,
"Last quarter, we said that the commercial price increases were going to take a while to work their way through and we saw some of that pickup in Q3. Some of that pickup on in Q3. So, I'm not suggesting that commercial customers are completely sitting on the sidelines at all",,,
"I think that with our great product lineup, we're certainly able to make the sales that we need to make in that space and get them off kind of the fence","sales,products_services",Positive,Uncertain
"So, Rod, let's just make sure we're level set",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, what I have is for OI&E last year was a negative $65 million in Q3 and for this year it's a negative $66 million",,,
"So, I don't see a real big difference there on a year-over-year â€“ are you looking at a full year basis?",,,
"Sorry, I haven't been focused on Q4 last year",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I don't remember off the top of my head what happened last â€“ can we take that offline and I can look at that? And maybe even while we're talking here, I can look it up",,Neutral,Uncertain
But I havenâ€™t focused on it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then, on OpEx, OpEx numbers were a little higher than we had modeled",,,
Maybe we just mismodeled it in July,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

Iâ€™m sorry,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Can you say that again?,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, the big drivers off of normal sequential performance from Q3 to Q4 is basically the units that we expect to be able to place",,,
"We have made great progress in our Printing business on our cost structure, and that is enabling us to go into the market and find opportunities that used to be negative NPV opportunities that are now positive NPV opportunities and we expect to take advantage of those opportunities",op_costs,Positive,Confident
Thatâ€™s the biggest reason for not being in normal sequential,,,
The other is that we do have commodity cost increases that we see in Personal Systems,op_costs,,
We don't guide at an OpEx or an operating profit level,earnings,,
"We are fairly well hedged, in the sense that we have a fair amount of inventory, strategic buy inventory",,,
"But that's never for multiple quarters or has never been for multiple quarters, and so we will absolutely face increasing commodity costs, both in Q4 to some extent and into 2018.",op_costs,,
I don't really think of the cash conversion cycle as redefining itself,,,Uncertain
"For this quarter, very pleased with the performance",,,
"We had a cash conversion cycle of minus 35 days, which was five days better sequentially",,,
"But as I mentioned, that was really driven by the incredible strength and sequential performance of the Personal Systems business",,,
"Because the Personal Systems business has such a negative cash conversion cycle that when it grows â€“ its growth increases sequentially, you're going to see a fair amount of free cash flow",sales,Positive,Confident
"Similarly, if the growth is less in the following â€“ in the next quarter sequentially, you're actually going to see a little bit of a reduction in free cash flow",sales,Positive,Confident
"What we expect for this year is that we would do at least $3 billion in free cash flow, so making great progress on free cash flow, and that our cash conversion cycle would likely end the year at a minus 29 days, kind of in line with FY 2016's exit",,Positive,Confident

"Well, let me start sort of long-term, and Cathie might want to weigh in a little more than that",,,
"Iâ€™d still remind everybody this is still a $333 billion market that one in five machines got an HP logo on it, means four out of five donâ€™t; that represents opportunity for us",,,
Iâ€™ve said consistently that the market is consolidating; the top four grew 3.5%,,,

"First of all, we welcome the Samsung print team to our family",,,
"And for our new investors, we bought this business for three primary reasons",,,
"Firstly, the A3 market is a $55 billion market and we are underpenetrated in that market relative to the A4 market where we have very strong market leadership",,Positive,Confident
"The traditional A3 players operate very complex machines, if you were to break those machines down, they would -- you would see thousands of parts on the ground",,,
"The Samsung technology really disrupts those traditional copiers with copier level performance but significantly less complex machine, the thousands of parts, when you were to break a Samsung down would be hundreds of parts",,,
And this lowers the cost to operate and that translates to increased margins for our partners and/or lower cost per page for our customers,"sales,earnings,op_costs",,
"So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability, thereâ€™re certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals",products_services,Positive,Confident
"Now having a very full portfolio, actually opens up A4, new A4 opportunities for us",,,
"And the third is, we now have incredible thing, we inherited more than a 1,000 top class engineers, industry-leading R&D team in laser space, includes go-to-market capability more than 6,500 patents being added to our core",,,
And I think this newly combined team is increasingly diverse and industry-leading,,,Uncertain
And so with that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to attract at least 12 points -- or 12% of A3 market share in the next three years,,,
"The other thing to remember Toni on Samsung is that still the largest portion of the composition of the revenue today is A4. Youâ€™ll recall that we acquired these assets, so the A3 capability which was still largely in an investment mode","sales,organic_expansion",,
"And so, as we move more and more into the A3 market and we shift the business from transactional to contractual, that generally comes with the higher supplies attraction",,,
And so the composition of supplies over time is indeed going to change,,,

"I would just say that this has been a material business for us thatâ€™s grown up over the last 18 months from nothing to a sizable portion, not only in terms of revenue but the gross margin that it drives, as well as the halo effect that it has on the overall brand, which I think is lifting our premium segment as well as every other segment that we had within the PC business","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain

I think itâ€™s really worth reiterating why we acquired this asset,,,Uncertain
It was not to buy revenue,sales,,
And Iâ€™m being pretty clear about that as is Cathie,,,
We donâ€™t chase share for shareâ€™s sake,,,
"And whilst the revenue is interesting, itâ€™s not fascinating",sales,,
Whatâ€™s fascinating for us is the incredible disruptive technology that this team invented to take on a pretty unconsolidated A3 $55 billion copier market with a better mousetrap that enables our partners to earn more money and enables a lower cost per page for our customers with a very different value proposition from a servicing perspective,op_costs,,
"More than a 1,000 engineers of very rich portfolio of patents",,,

In the quarter we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations,,,
"We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock",,,

Now let me turn to guidance,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First, some context",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First, while we see strong momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third party analysts",sales,Positive,Confident
"We feel great about our annual cadence of product innovations with new product launches planned this year including Skylake for data center, eighth generation core, 64-tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
"Second, we continued to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels",,Positive,Confident
"Third, the Data Center business has solid momentum with the mid-summer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor",,,
"And forth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group",,,
We expect to realize a pre-tax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million,,,
This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter,,,
"And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company and we are making an important commitment to our owners today",,,
We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017 and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time,sales,,
"We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue which we expect to reach no later than 2020. As a result, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share",sales,,
"As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year over year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security",sales,,
"We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year over year, gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63% and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year over year","sales,earnings",,

"With that, let me turn it over to Mark",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full-year revenue to be up $0.5 billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year",sales,Positive,Confident
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I would just say that our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term",earnings,,
"And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income",sales,Positive,Confident
"Against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the three-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward",,,
"Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter",sales,Positive,Confident
"As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively easy comp",sales,Positive,Confident
"So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Yes, I would, Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG","sales,earnings",,
"Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%",sales,Positive,Confident
"In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9 point drop in margins, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it'll be the first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer","sales,earnings",,
"As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation",op_costs,,
So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we allocate cost to the business segments,op_costs,Negative,NIL

"The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the Data Center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology","sales,earnings",,
It bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business,,,
So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year,,,Uncertain
"Yeah, that's true, and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our improvement throughout the course of the year",,,
"Yeah, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year","sales,earnings",,
"Again, it will be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business",earnings,,
"It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs",op_costs,Negative,NIL
"And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business","earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident
"The lowest point Q1 expectations will grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full-year operating margins despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs at roughly 40% for the year","sales,earnings,op_costs",,

"And second, our R&D cost particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer goes up little bit",op_costs,,
"So during the course of the year, our overall cost will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses",op_costs,,
"And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically",,,

Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year,,,
"Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record",sales,Positive,Confident
A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology,,,
"And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry's first, and to date only, 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs",,,
Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers,,,
"And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently which will ship for revenue this year, Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year",sales,,

The combination of strong execution and favorable market conditions is accelerating our path to profitability,earnings,Positive,Confident
Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter ahead of our earlier estimate and we expect it to remain profitable for the balance of the year,earnings,Positive,Confident
We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target,earnings,Positive,Confident

What we've projected for the second half is quarters that are pretty much in line,,,
We continue to expect enterprise to continue to decline,,,
It declined a bit more in the second quarter than I think we had really projected,,,Uncertain
It declined at about 11%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But if you look at Q1, it declined a little less than we expected at 3%",,,
But we still expect it to decline in those high single digit numbers,,,
"Cloud though, and grew greater than we what expected at 36%",,,
"We expect it to be in the mid 20s, probably more likely",,,
"And then networking and comms, 17% and the adjacencies at 12%",,,
So we expect that trend to continue,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We don't need any big shifts in those trends to really get to that high single digit growth rate for the data center,sales,Positive,Confident

You see the largest number of prequalification samples sent out to customers,,,
You see the cloud applications,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We try to talk about it's the largest performance improvement in a decade, gen to gen",,,
So we're seeing a very large ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable,,,
"And so I think that's what's going to fuel second half 2017, and then but it's going to continue on into 2018 as well",,,Uncertain
So I think that's how we see the second half playing out,,,Uncertain
Sure,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So let's make sure we clarify, right, so on traditional NAND, we are breakeven this year",,,
"And we broke even actually this quarter, and we expect to remain there the rest of the year",,,
"When we talk about for next year, that's inclusive of 3D XPoint",,,
"And so the difference is really as we ramp products on through the XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68, both of those",products_services,,
"Whenever you're ramping a factory, because you have a certain amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going, you tend to have slightly higher costs",op_costs,,
And so that's what you see as the driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
I want to also say that the 64-tier NAND products gives us a cost and performance advantage just because they're leading edge products as well that is going to play into as we move through the remainder of this year and next year,"op_costs,products_services",,
"So it's 64-tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp-out of Fab 68, and then the real startup and continuation in getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us â€“ everything profitable next year","earnings,products_services",Positive,Confident

I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
You'll see quarters like Q1 that were 3% or 4%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We've seen quarters higher than the 11% over the last couple years,,,
"So it's going be lumpy as we see this shift, but the overall macro shift of enterprise to cloud or traditional on-prem systems to cloud is going to continue",,,
"I think we'll also see, we still again, talking to our partners, thinking that mid-20% for cloud growth, but I think we'll see quarters like this quarter that was a little bit high",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
Other quarters we've had in the past have been more in line,,,
So I don't think we're talking about something going normalizing,,,Uncertain
I'd say it's still going to stay relatively lumpy like this,,,
"But if you look at it over the long haul, even when you look at the first half of the year, 11% down this quarter, 3% down last quarter, you take a look at those on average and you get to that high single-digit number",,,
"So I still feel like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down, and then the cloud will continue to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes into the cloud",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Sure, Vivek",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think in general, we see competition across almost every one of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business, and it's come from a variety of sources",competition,Neutral,Uncertain
"You're right, AMD has raised up a bit with their more recent products, but you see us responding",products_services,,
"This is a traditional performance battle that we're very accustomed to, and we're comfortable in reacting and competing very aggressively in",,,
And so you see us coming out with our Xeon Scalable,,,
"You'll see us make maneuvers like we accelerate our Core i9 products, which are all the way up to 18 thread systems on the client based products",products_services,,
"So I'd tell you that yes, we're seeing increased competitive pressure from a variety of places",,,
"But that actually will just drive us even harder, make us better in the end",,,
And we're comfortable that we can make the right products to deliver the right performance against those,products_services,,
"Sure, so on 10-nanometers we are sampling, engineering samples to customers currently",,,
The yields on 10-nanometers are continuing to improve pretty much right in line with the forecasted ramp rates,,,
"It's a new technology, so you always have some problems to get solved but we're pretty comfortable with where we're at right now",,,
"Like we said in the earnings script, we are set to qualify the first production products right towards the end of the year","earnings,products_services",,
You'll see those start to ship in the first half of next year and you'll see a ramp of SKUs,,,
"One of the things we're seeing is each one of these technologies, and actually products that we generate, we're generating quite a few more SKUs, Vivek",products_services,,
"And so you'll see a variety of SKUs progressing through 2018 as we ramp the 10-nanometer products, starting with the, I'll call it, more simpler SKUs at the beginning, going all the way through the high performance, high complexity SKUs towards the middle and back half of the year",products_services,Positive,Confident
Which is it's a traditional ramp like you see us push out on a new product ramp,products_services,,
"So I think, Stacy, first, we're quite proud of the growth rate we're seeing and especially the growth rates in the growth segments",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"We're forecasting mid 20s for the cloud business, the networking and storage business and adjacencies on down",,,
"What we're having to counter is not only the comps that Bob talked about, but the declining function of the enterprise, right",,,
And so those two things counter those growth rates,sales,Positive,Confident
"Now, as the enterprise continues to shrink, it will become less and less moving forward",,,
"So we agree that over time, this will become a smaller and smaller impact to the growth rates",sales,Positive,Confident

It weighs on our ability to get the growth rate higher,sales,Positive,Confident
"Sure, John",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So we expect the second half of 2017, from an ASP perspective, to be pretty much what you've seen in the past, where ASPs continue to increase on the various platforms of Xeon, right",,,
"So looking at each one, you'll see ASPs overall increasing",,,
"What you're seeing on this is a little bit of mix, right, so as you saw, networking and storage grow at 17%, the adjacencies at 12%",,,
Those are starting to become a little bit more a percentage of that business and those draw down the overall ASPs a little bit,,,
"But if you look within just the Xeon core function, those ASPs continue to increase at about the normal rates that you'd expect, especially as you move into a new architecture like Xeon Scalable",,,
Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC That's helpful,,,
"And then for my follow-on, just turning to the Client Compute Group, your ability to sort of segment that market and drive higher mix has been sort of a multiyear endeavor with a lot of success",sales,,

I actually think there is,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So I think if you take a look at this, John, what's driven this has not been clever segmentation necessarily",,,Uncertain
It's been the ability to segment into specific markets and specific performance,,,
And so things like Core i9 are a good example where you're really targeting performance,,,
"And so what I believe is that what the growth areas in the client space, gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring performance and power",sales,Positive,Confident
And remember those are always somewhat tradeable as you take a look at this,,,
"And so those trends are going to continue, and that's why that's as we talked about, how do you feel about competition, where do you see competition playing",competition,Neutral,Uncertain
We believe our leadership and performance will continue to allow that trend to continue and continue to allow the trend within CCG to continue as well,,,
And that's part of what drove the forecast for the second half,,,
Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you,,,
"So, yes is the simple answer, Romit",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Remember this isn't necessarily us raising prices,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So it's not we're out there going and saying okay, I'm going to charge $10 more for the next Core i7. It's actually the percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units, and we continue to deliver higher performance at the same price with each one of these generations",,,
"So what you're seeing is actually an overall trend that, yes, units are down",,,
"We talked about that, both I and Bob, around TAM being down somewhere in that low to mid-single-digit range",,,
And that's pretty much in line with what I'm seeing third parties here,,,
Some third parties are a little bit better than that,,,
"But for the most part, we're within a couple of percent",,,
"But yes, we believe that there is room for continued demand, for movement upwards",,,
So the number of Core i7s,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"the number of Core i9s, the number of people buying the performance thin and light laptops, those are going to continue",,,

Now they are targeting that more and more as well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's continuing to climb,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It is, but don't forget even within that Core mix, Romit, you have the ability to continue to scale up",,,
"So Core i3 versus Core i5 versus Core i7 and now we've introduced the Core i9, which is even higher performance",,,
"So we saw early on people choosing Core over Pentium or Atom, for example, and you saw the Core mix move up",sales,,
"You're now seeing not only that continue to climb, but you're going to see within Core the amount of Core i7s, Core i9s, Core i5s continue to climb as well",,,
And that's why we continue to see that there are legs behind this,,,
"And you said are we getting credit for this, so we don't think when you look overall this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the segments",sales,Positive,Uncertain
"You look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to drive better operating margin, and to continue to drive performance into the PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite good","sales,earnings",Positive,Uncertain
"Yes, it's very little",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We don't give out exact percentages by SKU like that,,,
But I can genuinely tell you that it is really just the beginning of the ramp of the Xeon Scalable,,,
And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"What you'll see is, as it ramps into the second half, it becomes a higher and higher percentage, and really the big volume is going be 2018. So that's when it really takes over from the way the data center looks from a revenue and profit standpoint","sales,earnings",,
"What we're excited about is we talked about the 500,000 units that are out there",,,
That was the highest number of pre-samples,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
That shows you the demand by the big infrastructure guys around the performance,,,
"They were willing to take the product even before, quote, we were ready to start shipping it",products_services,,
"And then the number of records we've broken already in performance, we talked about 50 records worldwide already",,,
Those are laying the groundwork for how this ramp is going look and feel as we move into the second half and into 2018.,,,Uncertain
So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data center,,,
We do sell into client as well but that's not the main focus of this business,,,
"And so I'd tell you when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in the future, that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but the high performance end","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
So we're not going after commodity SSDs that you're going to see even in high-end workstations necessarily,,,
It's really focused towards the data center products,products_services,,
"Even still, there's not all SSDs and data centers are high-end performance",,,
So we're comfortable with where we are in a market share,,,
We want to balance those investments against the demand for these high performance areas and make sure we keep that in balance,organic_expansion,,
And our real goal is then to move more and more of the business towards the 3D XPoint as we move into next year because that really differentiates us again as we really change the hierarchy between memory and storage as the data center DIMM memory systems come out,,,

"I'll talk more about what's driving these results in a minute, but given its tax season, let's focus there first",,,
"Despite the slow start to tax season, we remain confident it's simply a shift in timing, with the do-it-yourself software category and TurboTax performing well season-to-date",,,
This timing shift did lead us to update our outlook for the quarter while reaffirming our full-year guidance,,,
Each tax year is different,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

The IRS data released this morning showed total e-filed returns are down 13% with self-prepared e-files down 11% and assisted e-files down 16%,,,
"When you compare these results to the data that we released today, the conclusion we reach is that do-it-yourself category is performing better than assisted and we are performing well within the do-it-yourself category",,,
So it's helpful to put our season-to-date results into this context,,,
"Now, let me take a minute and remind you the four main drivers for the consumer tax business",,,
The first is a total number of returns filed with the IRS,,,
The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software,,,
"The third is our share within the do-it-yourself software category, and the fourth is the average revenue per return",sales,,
Total returns filed with the IRS have grown on average 1% per year over the last five years,,,
"Now, we've grown quite a bit faster than that by focusing on growing the do-it-yourself software category and then growing our share within that category",,,
"So despite the slow start to this season, do-it-yourself software is once again growing faster than other methods and our volumes suggest that we are performing well within the category",,,
"Now, the question on everybody's mind is what's behind the slow start to the filing season? There could be several reasons",,,
The IRS suggested in its release that the PATH Act has led some to delay their tax filings,,,
"Now, as a reminder, the PATH Act is new legislation in service to fighting tax fraud that delayed refund processing to February 15th or later for anyone who is filing for the earned income or additional child tax credit",products_services,,
"Now, regardless of the root cause, we remain laser-focused on making sure we have the best offerings and an awesome end-to-end experience for our customers",,,
Now there's no question this is a fiercely competitive tax season with new entrants joining the completely free category,,,
"Free offerings are not new to the category and they're not new to us, and our strategy to win with free remains unchanged",,,
We are firm believers that not all free products are the same,products_services,,
Having the best free offer and a delightful end-to-end experience is what sets us apart,,,
"With Absolute Zero, we continue to believe that we have that winning experience",,,
It's an alternative that is innovative for than 60 million people who file a simple return and may be overpaying for this service somewhere else,products_services,,

"In the end, they pay hundreds of dollars to file their taxes",,,
"This is where SmartLook comes in, providing access to an expert at the touch of a screen for a much lower cost",op_costs,,
Now this is simply one of the many innovations that our tax team delivered this season,,,
"Other innovations include improving data import through taking a picture on a smartphone, while continuing to expand available W-2 and 1099 forms for direct download",,,
We've also been applying machine learning and artificially intelligent algorithms to the data to get maximum deductions in less time,,,
"We're transforming TurboTax from an application to a platform, with our first partner, providing the ability for customers to refinance their student loan at a much lower rate",,,

"As we've talked about these emerging markets, one of the key indicators is lifetime value to cost to acquire a customer, LTV to CAC",op_costs,,
As you know the FASB standard is anything north of 3 to continue to invest,,,
"Right now in the United States, our QBO LTV to CAC is 5.5. If you add in desktop it's 6.9, and if you actually do a worldwide blended number, it's 4.5. So we feel good that we have a proxy and know that we're driving towards good profitable growth","sales,earnings",Positive,Uncertain
And the second thing is Neil and I worked with the businesses and we have a guideline for the Small Business Group that's keeping that business unit contribution while we're in this investment phase around 40%,organic_expansion,,
"It may go up or down a point or two based upon choices we make, but that's a very good healthy margin for a business that's in good growth but also continuing to deliver the kind of rigor we want on the bottom line","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident

You followed the business for a lot of years,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"A desktop unit has an average of two e-files each, and then a TurboTax unit is one-for-one",,,
"So what we try to do is since the IRS reports the number of e-files received, we try to then tell you how many have we actually processed",,,
And what you saw with the IRS data released this morning is that self-prepared e-files were down about 11% year over year through February 17. Our data shows that we're down about 10% through February 18. And so the net-net on that is we're basically holding to slightly up in terms of our share in the category,,,
"Now, looking at the table, is there something in the table that we need to clarify?",,,
"Yes, so, Scott, right now what the headline is units are down 5%",,,
"Our e-files, if you translate that into e-files, are down 10%",,,
"And then the IRS on an apples-to-apples is down roughly 11% for the self-prepared category, which basically says what Dan's quote is, we feel good about how we're performing thus far season to date",,,Uncertain
"No, thanks for the question, Scott",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Actually we have reconciled against the IRS, and the answer is it does not change materially the outcome that we just described, which is we're performing slightly better than the DIY category and certainly better than the overall IRS returns and much better than assisted",,,

"Thanks for the question, Jesse",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

What's really driving is the U.S,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"is up about 36%, outside the U.S",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"And then you add on top of that QuickBooks Self-Employed, which in the quarter added about 70,000 active users and that's more than all of last year's 60,000. But the real driver behind it is product market fit",products_services,,
"As you know, we have a test of readiness, which is in every market, are we able to deliver the benefit the customer says is most important and is our ability to deliver that benefit better than the best alternatives in the market? And once we see that light go green, then we lean in to the accountant channel and we'll start to make more increased investments in advertising",organic_expansion,,
So the product is really driving the acceleration of velocity and then we put topspin on it by putting more marketing into those markets because we feel good about the product market fit,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"And that is currently in Canada, the UK, and Australia",,,
"And we've mentioned to you, we haven't taken our eye off of the ball in India, France, and Brazil",,,

"So overall, it is accelerating velocity",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So retention continues to look healthy for us even with this influx of new users, we're still looking at that first year cohort of around 70%",,,

"The other thing that we talked about going into the season, and Dan Wernikoff did a wonderful job at Investor Day, is we're looking to add more value to our product lineup to attract higher value customers into the category and ultimately into TurboTax's franchise",products_services,,
So SmartLook right now is focused on those customers who've historically paid hundreds of dollars to go to an assisted method and we're bringing them into our category,,,
The other thing is TurboTax Self-Employed right now is at an $89 price point,,,
"And by hooking that up with QuickBooks Self-Employed, we're getting more of those kinds of customers as well",,,
"So I think you're going to see price realization continue to be a little healthier, if we continue to bring these higher value customers into the category while we remain competitive on free on the low end",,,Uncertain

We may have shared â€“ we'll have to go back and see,,,
"I'm trying to go from memory, if we actually sized that in our Investor Day materials",,,
"I can't remember off the top of my head how many of the 400,000 firms are multi-service firms",products_services,,
"I'm thinking it's somewhere in the two hundred and some thousand, but did we size that?",,,Uncertain
"I'm going to be guessing, Sterling",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let's get that answer and then we'll make sure we get that out to everybody,,,
But I thought in Cece's section that she had sized it in the ProConnect update,,,
"Okay, sorry about that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's a good number,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's a healthy number,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"All right, thank you",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Jim, we've had a pretty consistent set of guiding principles out there, and then I'll add the asterisks onto this year, as we shared at Investor Day",op_risks,,
So the principles are the four main drivers are the number of units or the number of returns filed with the IRS and then what percent of those are actually going into the do-it-yourself category,,,
"Underneath that, we fight for share and then ultimately we try to get a good revenue per return",sales,Positive,Confident
"As we were going into this year, we always say we like to see units grow faster than revenue and we like to see the category grow faster than the alternative method because that sets up a good lifeline for future monetization",sales,Positive,Confident
"Now, what we did this year in addition to that â€“ so nothing has changed in our strategy",,,
What we've done in addition to that is we've leaned into higher value opportunities,,,
"So SmartLook is trying to get these higher paying customers out of the assisted method, and we've also leaned in TurboTax Self-Employed",,,
"So we'll see what that does to return at the end of the year and ultimately what that does to revenue, but we're still striving to have healthy unit growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"And in a good situation, we'd like to have units outpace revenue",sales,Positive,Confident
"I'd say, Jim, it's early days this year",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're getting a lot of good learning, and this is the first of a platform strategy you saw play out in QuickBooks that we're now bringing to TurboTax",,,
"So I think it's going to be fairly immaterial this year, but I think we're going to leave here with a wiser set of ideas and thoughts as we enter into next season, and we're playing that one for the long game",,,Uncertain
So I'd say it'll be relatively immaterial this year,,,
"You're welcome, Jim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Hey, Michael",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I appreciate the questions as always,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me start first with we have a lot of respect for all of our competition,competition,,
"As I mentioned a few minutes ago, everyone out there is being aggressive",,,
Let me talk specifically to IBM Watson that you referred to,,,
We've been talking about machine learning and artificial intelligence for some time,,,
"In fact, it's not new, and we've been leaning into it aggressively since 2010. To give you a couple of stats, we have over 100 patents pending right now on machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies",,,
We have 30 already in the market,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
These are algorithms,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
These are machine learning capabilities that do things like helping somebody in TurboTax understand quickly whether they should just go with the standardized deduction or do itemized deductions,,,
And that could save as much as 40% of the time it takes to do the return,,,
"In QuickBooks, we have this thing called Smart Sort, which is the ability to automatically categorize whether something is a personal or a business expense, which allows you to basically make the right kinds of decisions when you file a Schedule C",op_costs,,
And there's a whole host of other things that we're doing with artificial intelligence,,,
"So we are excited about the capabilities, we're always leaning into the future",,,
"And for us, this isn't a new announcement, we've been talking about it for some time",,,
"And it's been showing up, we believe, in not only our product scores, but also in our market share gains",products_services,,
The second is on the website,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Right now, we haven't broken down our funnel metrics",,,
We'll do that and we always do that pretty transparently at Investor Day,,,
We don't tend to do it midseason,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But you heard us reaffirm our confidence for the full year,,,
"So that gives you some insight into how we're feeling about her funnel metrics, which include conversion and retention",,,
"I think beyond that, at this point, we need to see how the full season plays out",,,Uncertain
"John, thank you for that question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think the solace that we all take some comfort in is that everyone has till April 18 to file,,,Uncertain
"So whether they've jump in right now and it's coming back at the pace we hope, or they're going to wait until April 13, April 14, April 15 and dive across the finish line",,,
We're prepared for any of those scenarios,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're out there, as Neil said, making sure that our message is out there today as they're making decisions",,,
But we're going to stay in the game all the way to April 18. I think there's a lot of pace that's going to have to pick up between where we sit today and April 18. But that deadline is coming and so I think it's just a matter of when,,,Uncertain
"No, you're welcome, John",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I didn't mean to interrupt you,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I was going to say we came in anticipating pretty aggressive season and we knew that there were going to be players that were going to mirror our Absolute Zero,,,
And so we haven't had to tweak anything from a product perspective,products_services,,
"As Neil did suggest though, we did start to make some adjustments to how we get our marketing message out there since the season got started a little later than we had anticipate",,,
"But we've been able to reallocate resources and kind of self-fund that, so that's really been the adjustment",,,
"Now, you might imagine we have a lot of contingency plans in place, if-then scenarios and those are sort of still on our back pocket",,,
And we'll just keep an eye on the competition and we'll make the right kinds of decisions as things move,competition,,
Okay,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I did have one â€“ I realized, Michael, I did not mean to not answer one of your questions",,,
This is for Michael Millman,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"You had asked about RAs, the refund advances",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think that we talked about this in the past that we exited that refund advance or refund anticipation loan business about a decade ago,,,Uncertain
We didn't feel that that was the right approach for families who were looking to get money in their pocket,,,Uncertain
"And so ultimately, we haven't had that offering for some time and during that period of time, the do-it-yourself category has grown and we've gained market share",,,
So we don't feel we're at a disadvantage this year any different than we have been for the last decade,,,Uncertain
We think the category is still going to grow and we're still going to gain share,,,Uncertain
"Yeah, I'll be happy to do that",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First of all, we want to thank everybody for your questions today",,,
"Obviously, we're still on the midst of this peak season and we do like the momentum, we're continuing to build in Small Business and you heard us reiterate our confidence in the game plan for tax",,,
We all know there's a lot of time left on the clock and your questions suggest there's still a lot of time for people to get their tax filing in,,,
We know that's going to have to happen between now and April 18. So we're looking forward to staying laser-focused and executing and we'll catch up with you on the after calls as well as talk again at the end of tax season,,,
"So thanks, everybody and have a good weekend",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
All right,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks, Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us",,,
We're pleased with our performance in our third fiscal quarter,,,
"As you know, this is our largest quarter of the year and we successfully delivered strong financial results in a complicated tax season",,Positive,Confident
"Exiting the quarter, our Consumer Tax revenue was up 9% year-to-date and is on track to finish at the high end of our guidance range for the full fiscal year",sales,,
We're also driving continued momentum in our Small Business franchise with QuickBooks Online subscriber growth accelerating to 59% and over 2.2 million subscribers which is above the upper end of the target we had established for the full fiscal year,sales,Positive,Confident
"As a result, we're raising our outlook for QBO subscribers to $2.3 million",,,
We're raising our full year revenue guidance and we're tightening the EPS range to the high end,sales,,
"All in all, we're on track to deliver another good year",,,
"With that overview, let me click down into the drivers of our performance in the third quarter, beginning with our tax results",,,
"This tax season proved to be eventful from beginning to end, but with the late start to the tax filing compared to prior years, a renewed competitive environment and a free category, a new IRS requirement designed to reduce fraud",,,
The combination of these factors were reflected in the 4 drivers of the tax business that we discussed with you on a regular basis,,,
The first driver is overall growth in the number of tax returns filed with the IRS,sales,Positive,Confident
"The latest IRS data indicate that total returns are down slightly, below the 0% to 1% growth that we have forecasted",sales,Positive,Confident
"If this trend plays out for the remainder of the tax filing year, it will be the slowest growth in total tax return since the year 2013. The second driver is the percentage of returns filed using do-it-yourself software",sales,Positive,Confident
"To-date, DIY category share has grown about 0.2 points, less than the 1.2 points that we expected",,,
"With that said, DIY category growth once again outpaced the year-over-year decline in the assisted tax prep methods",sales,Negative,NIL
The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself category,,,
"After strong share gains the past several years, our share with DIY e-file this season was flat",,Positive,Confident
This performance is below the 1 point of share gain that we strive to achieve each year and we're already designing innovative ways to accelerate customer growth as we look ahead to next season,sales,Positive,Confident
The fourth driver is revenue per return which has been stronger than our multiyear average of 1%,sales,Positive,Confident
Our pricing was relatively stable this season so the benefit resulted from a mix shift to the higher end of our product lineup,products_services,,
"So while the drivers of our tax results played out differently than expected, I am proud of the agile execution and innovation the team delivered this season",,,
"If you recall the game plan that we shared at our Investor Day in the fall, we outlined the plan to extend our leadership in do-it-yourself tax, began transforming the assisted tax category and ran experiments to evolve beyond tax through a tested open platform",,,
"This season, we made progress across several fronts",,,
"We leaned into SmartLook, providing broad access to an expert with the simple touch of a finger at a much lower cost than going to a tax store",op_costs,,
"We also began driving value to the broader Intuit ecosystem, leveraging the credit score functionality in Mint to provide more than 1.3 million free credit scores to TurboTax customers this season",,,
"And we introduced the Self-Employed bundle of QuickBooks and TurboTax, targeting the freelancer and gig economy, driving strong results which I'll discuss in greater detail in a minute",,Positive,Confident
All of this was built on the investments we've made in innovation over the past several years in areas such as artificial intelligence where we applied for more than 100 patents and have more than 30 AI applications in market across the company,organic_expansion,,
"Putting the bill around Consumer Tax, we're exiting this season with strong financial results, although generated in ways that were different than what we'd expected",,Positive,Confident
We'll learn from our experience this season and continue to invest in our multiyear strategy to deliver against the long term objectives that we set for ourselves,,,
We'll share more details on our results and our long term strategy at our Annual Investor Day in the fall,,,
"With that overview on Consumer Tax, let's shift to the assisted tax result and ProConnect",,,
This business delivered results that were better than our expectations with year-to-date revenue growth of 2%,sales,Positive,Confident
ProConnect plays an important role across our ecosystem with approximately 60% of the TurboTax SmartLook agent being passed by our ProConnect tax experts in this season,,,
"We've also seen early success in driving QBO subscribers through our tax sales efforts, fostering growth within the QBO franchise",sales,Positive,Confident
"With that overview on tax, let me now shift to Small Business",,,
"Subscriber growth continued to accelerate, driven by improvement across our platform that serves self-employed, small businesses and accountants",sales,Positive,Confident
We've also increased our marketing effectiveness and expanded our addressable footprint internationally in the self-employed segment,,,
"As I mentioned earlier, total QBO subscribers grew 59% in the quarter, up from 49% growth in the second quarter",sales,Positive,Confident
Our TurboTax Self-Employed offering contributed 11 points to the subscriber growth,sales,Positive,Confident
We continue to drive strong growth in both our core U.S,sales,Positive,Confident
business and international markets,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Outside the U.S,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
", our subscriber base grew 70% year-over-year to 433,000 subscribers",,,
"That's up from 61% growth in Q2. Within QuickBooks Online, the QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers doubled to 360,000, up from 180,000 last quarter and 75,000 just one year ago",sales,Positive,Confident
"During Q3, we launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore, adding another geography to our lineup and we expect to launch in Hong Kong and South Africa soon",,,
"Finally, our TurboTax Self-Employed offering has contributed approximately 160,000 subscribers to the QuickBooks Self-Employed total so far this year",,,
Our tax customer base is proving to be a great channel for reaching the self-employed and we know nearly 4 million TurboTax customers are self-employed tax filers,,Positive,Confident
I'm also pleased to report that QuickBooks Self-Employed customers who come through the TurboTax channel have a higher product recommendation score as well,products_services,Positive,Confident
"Our momentum in QBO subscriber growth is driving top line revenue with online ecosystem revenue growing 30% again this quarter, at the high end of our 25% to 30% target range",sales,Positive,Confident
We expect online accounting to be the primary driver of online ecosystem revenue for the foreseeable future as we prioritize feeding the global market with QuickBooks Online,sales,,
"Add-on services such as payroll and payments, the blade to the QBO razor, certainly remain important and they'll play an increasingly larger role in later chapters, but our strategic priority at this time is getting more QBO razors in the market",products_services,,
This playbook should sound familiar because it served us well for decades in the QuickBooks Desktop franchises,,,
"Putting it all together, our strategy of a vibrant One Intuit Ecosystem is gaining real momentum",,,
We're seeing proof points with more ecosystem connections between customers and products that are creating greater value for our customers and building sources and competitive advantage for Intuit,products_services,,
"Whether it's TurboTax driving self-employed customers for QuickBooks, it's ProConnect accountants serving TurboTax customers through SmartLook or the Mint credit scores being delivered to TurboTax customers, we're unleashing the power of the many for the prosperity of one",,,
You will hear more from us on this front in the coming months,,,
"But with that overview, I'm going to hand it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details",,,
"Thank you, Neil",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Q3 was another strong quarter for Intuit with a hard-fought tax season that brought some bright spots as well as opportunities to improve, but ultimately delivered at the high end of our revenue guidance for the tax business",sales,Positive,Confident
Small Business continued to gain momentum with accelerating QBO subscriber growth leading to an increase in our full year subscriber outlook and online ecosystem revenue topping the high end of our 25% to 30% target range for the second consecutive quarter,sales,Positive,Confident
"Collectively, we're driving strong progress for the One Intuit Ecosystem strategy, creating greater value for our customers and building new sources of competitive advantage",,Positive,Confident
"So with that overview and summary, Brian, let's hand it back to you to hear what's on everybody's mind",,,
Question-and-Answer Session,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thank you, Kash",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I love your optimism and your positive view on the business,,,
We feel the same way about the opportunity with self-employed,,,Uncertain
We know that this is a secular trend that continues to build momentum around the globe,,,
"And we discovered in TurboTax, we do indeed have a channel with 4 million of those tax filers being self-employed and we discovered, now with the bundle, that this year was really the first full year having in that season that we know how to optimize that conversion and get more of those customers in the funnel",,,
So we haven't put in the outlook out there yet,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We'll talk more about fiscal year '18 in August,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But like you, we see the real opportunity here and we think that this is just the early inning of what could be a long term growth driver for the company",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Thanks for the question, Michael",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me start by saying that we do believe that we left opportunity on the table,,,
We have very clear principles to grow our customers faster than our revenue and we want to continue to take share in the category,sales,,
"This year, we did not do either of those",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We actually did not grow our customers faster than revenue when we held share,sales,,
"But I would also tell you that, that doesn't mean next year is not going to be a good year for us",,,
"If you go back to 2013, that was a year where we grew our units at about 3%",,,
We stepped back,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We laid out a game plan,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And in 2014, we grew units 9%, 3x",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I can assure you, we've got a highly motivated team",,,
"And as Neil would say, bad batch, not a bad recipe",,,
So we're back to the cooking table and we're ready to do it again,,,
"Yes, Walter",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me break it down a little bit,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I'll break it into a 60, 20 and 20 sort of bucketing for you",,,
"The reason why we're able to still grow revenue at the high end of the range, 9% year-to-date, while we grow unit 2%, that's primarily because of mix",sales,,
"60% of that effect was the fact that we did not get as many free, free customers as we set out to do every year",,,
"And as I just mentioned in my prior response, we're going to sharpen our pencils and get back at that next year because we want to continue to grow the category and we want to continue to grow share",,,
"So by taking free, free out of the mix, that means that your average revenue per return or revenue per customer for the remainder is going to be higher",sales,,
That takes me to the 20% tranche,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And that 20% is we have continued to get more sophisticated in finding ways to add value to customers that they're willing to pay for,,,
"Some of those may be prior year free customers, some of those could be existing pay customers that they see value bundles that they think were worthy of them actually paying and that's helped us increase our revenue",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And then, the third bucket is the higher end of the product line, in particular TurboTax Self-Employed",products_services,,
"With that success we just talked about QuickBooks Self-Employed, there's a real winner there and that's the most expensive or the highest priced product in our product lineup",products_services,,
"So when you put that all together, it was fewer free, free which we actually view as an execution opportunity",,,
We continue to get better at creating value that customers are willing to pay for and we're also seeing some early success at the higher end of our product line which we think bodes well for the future,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Thank you, Jesse",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First of all, I would say that we don't need to sell anything else to a self-employed customer for that to be a great business",,Positive,Confident
There's hundreds of millions of these prospects around the world,,,
"And as we look at that opportunity and even at our current price at roughly $10 a month to $120 a month with a low cost to acquire those customers, that is a very good and profitable business that could be substantial for the company","earnings,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"So with that said, we're discovering already they have additional problems to be solved that they're willing to pay us for if we solve them well",,,
A great example is we added invoicing functionality into self-employed and that connects to payments,,Positive,Confident
And the ability for us to have them actually send an invoice and get paid in a matter of 8 days versus 28 days is a real opportunity for us to have razor blade,,,
Another example is the one we talked about earlier in the opening comments which is tax returns,,,
"The ability to have them do their self-employed, separating personal from business, management throughout the year and then come tax time, press a button and have it go into TurboTax or go to one of our accountants to do a credit return, that's also another razor blade",,,
"And we'll stay focused on other opportunities down the road, but by and large, the opportunity is getting more of these units and then solving additional problems, whether it's getting paid faster with an invoice or doing a tax return, those are the razor blades that are already emerging",,,
And we're still on the very early innings,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we're proud of that momentum we're seeing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Obviously, the 3 countries that drove the bulk of that were Canada and the U.K",,,
and Australia where we've got product market fit right coming out of the last summer and we've really been hitting the accelerator,products_services,,
"Brazil was on track, looking good",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're feeling confident that as we head into the summer months that, that looks closer to flaking into that green light that we're looking for on product market fit",products_services,,
France is right on its heels and we're still in the investigator phase on how to really figure out India,,,
The good news is there's changes in India with GST which is basically a new tax legislation that will drive more compliance,,,
And so our teams are really rolling up their sleeves to take advantage of that,,,
"In terms of additional countries, we're leading now with QuickBooks Self-Employed",,,
"We have found that to be the fastest, lightweight, easy to get into market and solve a problem and build a base",,,
So I just mentioned that we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore in the last quarter and we're going to be introducing it in Hong Kong and South Africa soon,,,
"And then, from there, we'll talk about, in the fall, whether we see other countries that we'll take QBO to",,,
"But right now, self-employed will be the point of the sphere",,,
"Behind the scenes, you might imagine, is a lot of scenario planning and a lot of adjusting on the fly",,,
It's a highly instrumented business,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're able to see, at any moment in time, how many people are in the product versus the same minute of the same day last year and then our teams are able to look at that and say, okay, do we need to adjust anything as we look ahead? We made adjustments throughout the season",products_services,,
I think we talked about it a little bit just on our last call,,,Uncertain
We had put some investment in advertising early in the season,organic_expansion,,
"And then, when we saw the delays to the tax filing, we had to go ahead and belly up to the bar and put a little more money into what we would typically think of as the trough which is after the season gets started, there's a little bit of a lull before the back half procrastinators jump in",,,Uncertain
But we advertised through the trough this year because we simply were going to have to come at some point and that paid off for us,,,
"In terms of next year, I'll say this",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We don't take anything for granted,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're telling you now, we know there are things we could have done differently and better",,,
And the neat thing about this business is we'll step back and we'll sharpen our pencils there and we'll lay out our game plan and we'll be ready for next year,,,
"And I anticipate another very competitive season next year, but I think this year demonstrates we have the ability to adjust, make the right calls and deliver the results that we're promising",,,Uncertain
So that's what we're looking forward to,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It's a little bit faster, but let me give you some context",,,
"I am excited to tell you now that if customers that are coming in to the QBO franchise, QuickBooks Online, if you throw in self-employed, it's now over 90% are new to the Intuit franchise",,,
And so that is an acceleration of even getting further category expansion and people into our business for the first time,organic_expansion,,
"And then, if you look at the desktop, we have, through 3 quarters now, 132,000 people who've migrated from desktop to QBO",,,
That's up about 25% year-over-year,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so we basically done in 3 quarters what we did in 4 quarters last year, but that's not driving the bulk of this growth",sales,Positive,Confident
90% of these customers are new to the franchise which is exactly what we wanted,,,
That's driving our overall active base and it's enabling us to capitalize on this TAM,,,
"Yes, Kartik",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I would say, first of all, we take the responsibility, as the champion of the do-it-yourself category, to grow the category",,,
We have a 65 share,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I believe, this year, a combination of things",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"There was a little bit of funkiness in the overall tax season that everyone is still seeking to explain and no one yet has answers, including the IRS",,,
So we'll have to sort through that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then, this year, we definitely leaned our advertising and marketing more into the transform-assisted strategy which is showing people they would never be alone",,,
"And with SmartLook, you would have access to an expert",,,
"And that certainly played out well for what we wanted to do, but I'm not sure that, that succeeded in helping us expand the DIY category at large",,,
And so we'll step back and take responsibility of what can we do to continue to accelerate that growth,sales,Positive,Confident
What we do know is we've got secular tailwinds,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And the secular tailwinds are showing that DIY is still growing faster than the assisted methods and we just have to find ways to continue to accelerate that secular trend,products_services,Positive,Uncertain
And we will do that as we look to next year,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yes, Kartik, I think it will actually tie to your prior question",,,Uncertain
This is good news for the category,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As you know, we've had lots of very good competition across many of our franchises over the years and every time a new competitor comes in, especially one that is well funded and they're aggressive in advertising and in pricing, that tends to accelerate the category growth because it gets more people and other masses to raise their head and get out of spreadsheets or come out of stores and say, wow, there might be a better way to do this","sales,competition",Neutral,NIL
So I believe you saw the early days of what hopefully is going to be a continuing advertising and marketing message that says there is a much better way to get your taxes done,,,
"And if we didn't do what we know we have to do, have the best product and have the cleanest value prop, I think that's going to be good news for the category and good news for us",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
So I anticipate a continuation of this year's ultra-aggressive competition and I think that's a good thing for consumers and I think it's a good thing for the category,competition,Neutral,Uncertain
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks, Raimo",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We'll divide and conquer on this,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So let me start with the first one on the number of small businesses that are still not in the accounting software category,,,
"They're using spreadsheets, shoeboxes, ink pens and checks and that number is still, believe it or not, 42%",,,
"And it is equal to not only those that are self-employed, but those that clearly could be in QuickBooks Online",,,
"In fact, in the U.S",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
", the number of people who are ripe for QuickBooks Online are about 20 million and we have 1.8 million of them today",,,
So there's a huge opportunity for us to show that there's a better way and that's why we're starting to lean in with more advertising and more category awareness in addition to working with accountants,,,
"So still a lot of greenfield and that represents itself, not only in the U.S",,,
", but all the countries we're going through around the globe",,,
Let me hand it over to Neil to talk about 606.,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Okay,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thanks, Ross",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The answer to your first question is no,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We really did not have any material changes in pricing or even the timing of pricing that would have affected the results the way that we're talking about here,,,
"In terms of the noncore revenue, I think is the question, we have created value bundles and we marketed those this year, bundles that include, we call them, Flots and other kinds of bundles that have things like fraud, audit defense and the ability to make sure that if anything happened, we had the ability for you to go in and keep an eye on your credit card and your credit reports",sales,Neutral,Uncertain

"Next year, we hope to be able to do with less friction and one of them was the one that Neil mentioned in his opening comments which is in an effort to try to ensure we got cybercriminals out, if you did not know your prior year adjusted gross income or you didn't know you tax filing PIN, then you were able to process your return using our software, but then you had to print it out and mail it",,,
You could not e-file it without those 2 pieces of information,,,
"And that ended up, in our case, with about 500,000 people who were able to do their taxes in TurboTax but had to put it in an envelope and send it into the IRS",,,

We had aspirations that we thought would be very positive,,,
I've got to tell you that we were delighted and surprised that we saw the strength in the TurboTax channel feeding QuickBooks Self-Employed which gives us even more reason to lean in more aggressively next year,,,
"And so I would say that we did not have 11 points modeled in, at the same time, we'll take it and we're going to say how do we blow on that ember and turn it into a raging fire as we look at next year",,,

Now we continue to get better and better each year,,,
So I really can't tell you and we're trying to hesitate to put out other hypotheses because I probably heard a half a dozen myself just having conversations,,,

So let me take this one then and then we'll get back to your other ones,,,
"That 500,000, they ended up processing using our product and paying that",products_services,,
So that's in that revenue per return,sales,,
"But then when they showed up at the IRS, the IRS counted them as paper because they showed up in an envelope and not coming through on e-file",,,

"But there's 500,000 that we did get paid for, so that shows up in our revenue, but it doesn't necessarily show up when the IRS prints its numbers and says, whoa, paper grew for the first time in a few years while it was because people processed with software and then had to mail it in because they didn't know their PIN",sales,Positive,Confident

"But our numbers are 2% unit growth, 9% year-to-date revenue growth and the average revenue per unit went up about 7% and that was the math that Jim was just asking about a few minutes ago as well",sales,Positive,Confident
"Okay, Michael",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

Cash taxes can also fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of estimated tax payments,,,

When we look at that we're looking at the midpoint of the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year and adding the outperformance in,,,
We get to a slightly lower number than that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"If you went to 25%, Patrick, you'd be factoring-in continued outperformance in the second half of the year which at this point in time we're not providing guidance around",,,
I think one of the challenges as well is you had an exceptionally strong Q4 a year ago when the momentum that we're seeing now really started to pick-up,,Positive,Uncertain
"That started in Q3, accelerated into Q4. So we're bearing in mind that we actually have a pretty difficult comparison in Q4. Nonetheless, the thing that we do want to call out is that order flow right now remains very strong through April and that's reflected in the Q2 guidance and the strength of order flow through Q1 is reflected in that as well",,Positive,Confident
So I'm not going to get drawn on the 25%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think I've given enough color around that, but if you add the amount that we estimate should be added to the midpoint of the original guidance, it's quite a bit below that 25% number",,,Uncertain
"So first of all, I think the kilowatts of units sold was up by about â€“ kilowatts of power sold was up by 60% and then valves in reference unit sales up by approximately 70%",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
So you've got a couple of trends that we're seeing there,,,
"First of all, yes, some degradation in ASPs particularly compared to Q1 a year ago",,,
"The ASP situation has been much more stable recently, but within that trend you've also got a couple of interesting things",,,
"First of all, ASPs can be impacted because the actual increase in 6 kilowatt and 10 kilowatt lasers, the ASP per kilowatt on those is slightly lower",,,
We've also seen unit volume increases in the 1 kilowatt and 2 kilowatts driven by some of the fine processing cutting customers in China and particularly moving up from 500 watts and 700 watts to our compact YLR 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt lasers and we've also seen in the 3D printing and additive business a transition from some of the medium power to the 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt lasers for that,,,
So those would also contribute to the increase in unit volumes at the lower power levels,,,
So there's a number of different dynamics that are happening there,,,
I'd say the really pleasing aspect of that is the general move up in power across several different applications and then the real acceleration that we're seeing in the 6 kilowatts to 10 kilowatts and now with customers demonstrating 12 kilowatts cutting systems,,,
30% is the number,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Thank you,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So the color we've given around this is that order flow remains very strong,,Positive,Confident
"We're choosing at this point in time to not give guidance on Q3, but state that the outperformance in the first half of the year should be added to the initial guidance that we gave",,,
"If order flow remains where it is, we're going to have â€“ just talking about this in a qualitative manner, a good strong Q3 performance as well",,Positive,Confident
I mentioned that order flow through April was in no way diminished from what we saw in the first three months of the year,,,
"And, so the overall trends behind the business are very strong",,Positive,Confident
We're choosing to give the guidance on Q2 rather than get drawn into the second half of the year at the moment,,,

"It's been an extraordinary period for us and I think that just is a testament to the execution, the quality of the product, as we've mentioned, and the acceleration of the adoption of fiber as compared to other technologies",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Do you want to talk to that, Valentin, a bit more?",,,
"The core business is still fundamentally driving the revenues at the moment, so the newer products are still really just starting out","sales,products_services",,
We mentioned some sales of the RGB for the cinema,sales,,
"That was a few units, but it was good to see that happen so it was a very small contribution",,,
"There's some acceleration in the telecom business which is helping a little bit, but that's more I'd say a thin layer of icing on a large cake at the moment",,,
"So if we can continue to execute around getting these newer products into the market, into addressing a broader part of the micromaterials processing business, we are seeing some penetration in micromaterials processing even with our core 1 micron product, but we hope to see significant improvement in that with some of the ultra-fast product and the UV applications",products_services,,
"So there's still â€“ you know the great thing is, there's still not much contribution from those",,Positive,Confident
And when they start to come to bear on revenue it should be a good backup that we have,sales,Positive,Confident
"I think competition is finding it extremely difficult to compete across the leading edge of the technology of the product, which drives the different performance parameters in terms of electrical efficiency being one, beam quality, the tremendous scale that we have on manufacturing, the service and support we have around the world, the application laboratories that support that service and sales, the investment that's gone into that","sales,products_services,organic_expansion,competition",Neutral,Uncertain

They're starting to get some more momentum into it,,,
And it's not just the consumer electronic cycle spend this year,,,
"We talked about some of the automotive and other areas, for example pipe welding",,,
"On the cutting side, I think this is a difficult thing to state without â€“ there's very little data behind it, but one of the things we've said is that you shouldn't just focus on the annual sales of high-powered lasers for cutting applications",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
You should look at how deeply penetrated fiber is into the installed base,,,
"And there are different numbers in terms of total in store base of cutting systems, 60,000-plus of them around the world",,,
Fiber a year ago was probably less than 30% of that installed base,,,
"Now we're being not as aggressive maybe, only 25%",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We think there's an acceleration of the replacement of some of the older CO2 lasers, because job shops just cannot be competitive with that technology as more and more fiber lasers are deployed in the field",,,Uncertain
Right? So they're increasing against job shops that have a fiber laser,,,
"The CO2, even if it's older and fully depreciated with its high maintenance and running costs, is just no longer a viable alternative",op_costs,,
And we've seen that commentary coming out of a couple of surveys that we've seen,,,
So it's a number of different things across different applications,,,
"Then you've got some of the other applications in ablation, the cleaning, the hole-drilling was a good contributor on the QCW",,,
So the QCW wasn't just welding,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And these are all area that we're looking for growth, so it's across a variety of different things that we're succeeding at",sales,Positive,Confident
So the great thing is that it's across a variety of applications and a lot of those applications are generally sort of organic with what we think are sustainable trends in the market,organic_expansion,Positive,Uncertain
"And the one thing that's just â€“ is always a two-year cycle is the consumer electronics stuff, but certainly the outperformance that we're showing in the first half of the year isn't just driven by that",,,
That's really no â€“ a relatively even small part of it,,,
"Of course, that's probably a bit of a thicker layer of icing on the cake than the newer applications, but it's not just that",,,
"It is the cutting and the welding, those ablative processes, the drilling, which is a shift that you're seeing across a variety of different industries",,,
"So it's difficult to call it out for next year yet, but we think we're in an exceptionally strong position relative to the other technologies and even non-laser technologies at this point in time",,Positive,Uncertain
"We continue to remain in that range of 50% to 55% and are very, very pleased with executing at the top end of that range",,,
We've mentioned that you're always trying to balance the declines in ASPs across different product lines with new product introductions and getting a benefit from the higher power lasers in different product categories that we get to,products_services,Negative,NIL
We also are adding manufacturing capacity,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Valentin mentioned that we've got a tremendous uptick in unit and kilowatts of power that we have to keep up with,,,
"So you also try to balance your manufacturing efficiency with the semi-fixed labor costs that are brought on, the fixed costs that are brought on with increasing depreciation as you're placing buildings and equipment into service","op_costs,products_services",,

I think Valentin would probably second that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On the cost side, I think one of the interesting things here is that we think the market price of diodes is still around $10 per watt",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"Of course, some company's manufacturing is below that",,,
Our bill of material fully loaded on a large part of our kilowatt lasers is now at less than the market price,,,
But the entire bill of material on a cost per watt basis is less than the market price of diodes at the moment,op_costs,,

Nothing in particular,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think it's just waiting for the overall trends on order flow through end of Q2 and into the beginning of Q3, seeing how those are going to materialize",,,Uncertain
"You can see â€“ in about 50% of the time you see Q4 being lower than Q3. And that's generally driven by in those years where you have a strong consumer electronics cycle you can see China revenue a bit lower in Q4, so we'll watch that",sales,Positive,Confident
"But, we watch everything, Bobby, in terms of the different geographies and applications",,,
"So automotive, I think, is strong, and it's certainly strong and weaker, stronger in some areas and weaker in others",,Positive,Uncertain
"So, the real strength on automotive at the moment is North America and China, in particular",,,
"Europe's okay, not showing tremendous growth year-over-year on the automotive applications",sales,Positive,Confident

Sorry,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think we've disclosed in the K, and this is very approximate number because I could caution you again, the application date that we get sometimes is not the most accurate, but in all cutting applications both high-power and mid-power and even some of the QCW is about 50% of total revenue",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"The welding is about 20%, and then marking and engraving will be the next biggest application after that",,,

Trends on cutting continue to be very strongly,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We continue to see the displacement of the installed base of lasers and then move towards higher power, both with fine metal and that should continue to provide some sustained growth for the company",sales,Positive,Confident
"Clearly, the welding market is one that we have called out",,,
"We see that over a three-year horizon as being a fundamental area, where we want to execute not just on high-power but on QCW as well",,,
"In terms of like a three to five-year time horizon welding, the welding market we're targeting and growing substantially by displacing not only existing laser, but non-laser welding technology as well",,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think that's part of it to continue to gain traction with those relationships, continuing to compete fiercely against even the local companies like Raycus and other competitors there",,,Uncertain
"You've actually seen also a rebound in the business with our largest OEM there this year, and that's benefiting from recovery in their cutting markets",,,
"So, that customer continues to be very much sourcing their fiber laser technology at high-power and QCW from IPG",,,
"So there's different end market dynamics there, so you've got the welding market for EV, electronic vehicles, for batteries and other applications continues to be a driver too",,,
It definitely has continued through April,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

"So yeah, it's difficult to quantify like clearly relative to guidance and the outperformance, you can see how much of a surprise that has been to us",,,
"I think sometimes the inflection points on the upside, Jim, are some of the most difficult things to forecast, regardless of how good your relationships are with the OEMs. I think the OEMs themselves find it very difficult to forecast sometimes the adoption curve that they see on some of the applications",,,Uncertain
"For example, the move towards higher power levels",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

No,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Fundamentally, I think that this is pleasing",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Actually, you'll see our former largest customer will report some stronger sales this year",sales,Positive,Confident

We believe we are benefiting from our diversification strategy and I'm pleased with our overall performance,,,
We believe the biggest trend that is driving our industry and our strategy as a company today is the cloud,,,
"As the industry evolves, cloud architectures are no longer the exclusive domain of the cloud providers",,,
Customers across all verticals are developing strategies for moving to cloud service delivery models and this aligns with our strategy to power the cloud transformation,products_services,,
I'm pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 25% in the Cloud vertical and would point out that our cloud solutions are addressing the cloud transformation across all of our key verticals,sales,Positive,Confident
"In the quarter, we continued to deliver on our innovation roadmap and announced two new solutions for the data center",,,
"In January, we announced Juniper Networks Unite Cloud, a transformative data center solution that gives enterprises a simplified way to create and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments",,,
This solution delivers a secure and agile platform and is designed to reduce the total cost of ownership while increasing long-term return on our investments for our customers,"op_costs,organic_expansion",,
"At the OFC conference in March, we introduced our data center interconnect solution, Open Cloud Interconnect",,,
"This comprehensive DCI solution brings together our strength across packet and optical domains to enable a diverse range of network operators to accelerate cloud service delivery, while simplifying network operations",products_services,,
"Earlier this year, we were delighted and honored to receive Vodafone Group's most prestigious award for Supplier of the Year",,,
"Juniper is a strategic provider of IP routing and security technology for Vodafone, specifically for next-generation data centers, IP/MPLS (sic) [IP/MLPS] (05:06) backbone and mobile backhaul domains",,,
"We believe that our continued strategy to lead in network innovation in key areas such as automation, software-defined networks, and network function virtualization will continue to enable our Telco customers to build new and innovative business models going forward",,,
"Now, I'd like to summarize highlights across switching, routing and security",,,
"In switching, we saw continued data center strength with our QFX products family, which once again grew over 50% year-over-year and continues to increase as a percentage of our overall switching portfolio mix",products_services,Positive,Confident
"We are seeing continued traction in our QFX portfolio as customers across all verticals move to 100-gig, where we have industry-leading products",products_services,,
"Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX",sales,Positive,Confident
"We continued to see healthy demand for our newest generation of MX line cards, which had a record shipping quarter in Q1. Tremendous work has gone into the security product portfolio that we are very proud of",products_services,,
Juniper's differentiated SDSN strategy has been received very well by industry analysts and customers for its ability to detect and stop threats in a highly automated way,,,
The innovative approach of viewing security as an open platform allows customers to leverage all existing security investments as well as their entire network infrastructure,organic_expansion,,
"At RSA, we announced new technology alliance partnerships with leading security providers that simplify deployment of Juniper's security solutions across several customer use cases",,,
Our focus this year in security is on building confidence and momentum with our partners and customers,,,
We believe we are making good progress as evidenced by new logo wins with our newest security products,products_services,Positive,Confident
Several global trials are also underway with managed service providers using Juniper's secure cloud managed enterprise solutions,products_services,,
"We saw year-over-year growth in Contrail, and added several new customers in Q1, including a tier 1 operator in Europe",sales,Positive,Confident
There was a continued expansion of orders within our existing customer base as they increased their deployment footprint,organic_expansion,,
"We saw continued strength in our overall services business, which grew 14% year-over-year",products_services,Positive,Confident
"I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our professional services business, where we had a strategic win at a tier 1 service provider in EMEA",products_services,Positive,Confident
"To summarize, we are executing well in a competitive environment and are proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio",products_services,,
"The cloud is a massive paradigm shift that is reshaping all industries, and I'm excited about the opportunity we have in front of us",,,
"Looking at the remainder of 2017, we expect overall demand to be seasonal and believe our customer diversification is positioning us for growth as we navigate through volatile markets",sales,Positive,Confident
"I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper",,,

"Hi, Jess, it's Rami",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On the switching side, certainly, we're very pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. A big driver of that performance is in the data center and has a lot to do with the deliberate focused strategy that we've had on the data center, which certainly applies to the large cloud providers, but also other verticals as I mentioned in my prepared remarks",,,
Pretty much every one of our customer verticals now has a set of customers that's moving towards cloud architecture,,,
The heart of that is the data center,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We've always been in this space,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera",,Positive,Confident
"Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in",sales,Positive,Confident
And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term,sales,Positive,Confident
"I will also point out that there's another element of our switching business, which is the EX product line and that is in the campus",products_services,,
"And although the focus has been on the data center, we're really not taking our eye off the ball in the campus side",,,
"And in fact, we have this ability to leverage technologies that we have developed primarily for the data center",organic_expansion,,
"Think of our fabric technologies in innovative ways for the campus, and that is actually starting to help us provide some differentiation to our customers for larger campus environments",,,Uncertain
"And for that reason, we actually saw some pretty good momentum in the EX business, which helped overall switching in the Q1 timeframe",,,
"With that, Ken, you want to talk a little bit about gross margins?","sales,earnings",,
"Hi, Simona",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I will start with the follow up on routing and switching,,,
And then I'll pass it over to Ken,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So our routing businesses always depended on large deals, large customers across the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical, and for that reason, it's always been lumpy and I think we're seeing some of that dynamic more broadly",,,Uncertain
"Routing, as we all know now, as we have been talking about, we've sort of been predicting, is essentially a flattish type of overall market opportunity for Juniper and for our peers in this industry",,,
We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"That's true for Telco, for the Enterprise, for Cloud, for Cable and all of our strategic verticals",,,
"That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today",sales,Positive,Confident
And we're clearly taking more than our fair share there,,,
"I think the question underlying the question that you're asking is, is there some sort of a transition that's happening where architectures are moving from routing to switching and so on",,,Uncertain
"The way I view it is that each of our key product sets, whether it be the MX for programmable routing, the PTX for really lean, core transport-oriented routing and the QFX for switching opportunities, they have a sweet spot",products_services,,
One is really targeted for the edge,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
One is for wide area,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
One is more for the data center,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But even there, what happens is that the line starts to blur, and there will be some shifting, if you will, on the sort of the edges of the use cases between each of these products",products_services,,
But those sweet spots continue to be very important and something that our customers largely respect,,,
"There will always be some level of cannibalization, but for the most part, I think the opportunity, in aggregate, with these three technologies under our belt is a growing opportunity",,,Uncertain
Let me start and I'll start with the security question,,,
And then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about dividends and the dividend strategy,,,
"Well the first, there has been, and there continues to be a tremendous amount of work that's happening inside of Juniper to increase the competitiveness of our products overall, the solutions and security, the feature releases and the new code drops that we're making now are coming out on a very regular basis",products_services,,
"And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there",products_services,Positive,Confident
There is in fact momentum,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The feedback from our partners, our customers is positive",,,
And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business,sales,Positive,Confident
It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products,products_services,Negative,NIL
"So eventually, I think the math starts to work in our favor",,,Uncertain
We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth,sales,Positive,Confident
And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"I will just point out that the big part of the focused effort right now is on rebuilding confidence, rebuilding the channel and of course, one win at a time, including new logos that we have just gotten in the Q1 timeframe",,,
I think we can get this back on track,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So let me start,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First of all, I think the most important thing here is diversification",,,Uncertain
"It's not just about Cloud, it's not just about Telco",,,
"It's really about broadening and making sure that we are diversified really along three dimensions: first is in the technologies, so it's Routing, Switching, Security; second is in the Telcos and â€“ sorry, the verticals; Telcos and Cloud and so forth; and then also it's about geo",,,
"So, for example, we're starting to see good momentum or early momentum with the cloud providers in Europe",,,
We're starting to see also early momentum with the cloud providers in Asia Pacific,,,
So that diversification strategy has paid off well for us in the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to pay off well for us,,,
Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Right? I just mentioned, for example, Routing has always been somewhat lumpy as it pertains to the Cloud vertical or the Telco vertical, and I would expect that to remain the same going forward",,,
"Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The gross margin?,"sales,earnings",,
"As far as overachievement or underachievement, clearly we're seeing a lot of strength in the cloud space as well as in the switching business",,,
"Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies",sales,Negative,Uncertain
I want to just add to that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I completely agree with everything Ken just said,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"When you're operating in an environment where your customer mix is changing, the technology mix is changing, we're seeing a geo mix change as well, and in certain strategic initiatives like penetration to the cloud we're even ahead of where we expect it to be right now",sales,,
Predicting gross margins can be somewhat tricky,"sales,earnings",,
"With that said, there are a number of activities across the company right now all focused on improving gross margins","sales,earnings",,
"And we're running the business, as Ken just mentioned, with the assumptions that current levels are going to be here for a while, just in case",,,
So that's I think the way that you should think about how we're running the business and the dynamics of the industry that we operate in right now and our strategy as it pertains to those dynamics,,,Uncertain
"Yes, Rod, let me start, and I'll start with the second question, and then Ken can talk a little bit about the baseline",,,
"I know because we've now just re-categorized how we're reporting our numbers, so a little bit of expectation will probably be helpful",,,
"Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy",sales,Positive,Confident
"The fact that we are now in both Routing and Switching in any one vertical, Security to a lesser extent, but Routing and Switching, helps to offset some of that lumpiness",,,
But I expect that the lumpiness will exist and will remain in effect,,,
The good news is I still feel very good about our ability to compete in the Cloud vertical,,,Uncertain
"How close we are to our customers in the Cloud vertical, our ability to understand their requirements, their architecture, and the kinds of innovation that we need to put in place to participate in the Cloud vertical, and on all those counts I feel very good",,,Uncertain
"Sure, Jim",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I did mention earlier the fact that Security right now, there's quite a lot of effort that has gone into improving our products, making them competitive, differentiating in the solutions that we offer to our customers",products_services,,
And I think we're seeing very good momentum specifically in the newer technologies and solutions we've introduced into the market,,,Uncertain
"I mentioned the fact that there is a concerted effort right now in terms of go-to-market, marketing, rebuilding our channels, and rebuilding confidence in our customers and our partners' mind where we have quite frankly lost some of that confidence",,,
That's where the effort is,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio,,Positive,Confident
"So synergies are on the cost side where we tend to leverage a lot of the software development as well as the silicon technology across Routing and Switching into Security, and increasingly we're seeing actually very solid revenue synergies","sales,op_costs,organic_expansion",,
"If you think about what our SDSN, software-defined secure network, strategy is all about, it's about enabling our customers to use their network infrastructure in an intelligent way to provide a secure fabric, a very secure fabric to prevent essentially their infrastructure, their data, their workloads from being compromised",,,Uncertain
That is essentially enabling us to sell Security along with Routing and Switching in the data center or in the campus,,,
So I mean that's the other really important element of how we're approaching Security that I think is important for you to understand,,,Uncertain
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So I think that we're in the process of stabilizing right now,,,Uncertain
The newer products are growing,products_services,,

I appreciate that question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Of course, I have to always, as CEO of this company evaluate the performance of any one of our products, technology areas, and businesses",products_services,,
"I would just say that as it pertains to Security, which is I think what your question is about, the focus at this period of time is on turning around this business",,,Uncertain
"The data points that we're getting from our customers, our partners are all very positive at this point, and the synergies are really good",,,
"The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve: A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security","op_costs,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident

So that's how I'm thinking about it right now,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Thanks for the question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So the service business continues to be a highlight for us,products_services,,
It's a very healthy business for us,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well",sales,Positive,Confident
"As you mentioned, we did benefit this quarter from approximately $15 million of revenue that came off of the balance sheet",sales,,
So you have to factor that in as you start thinking about the rest of the year,,,Uncertain
"But I do expect Security after you normalize â€“ I'm sorry, services, after you normalize for that $15 million, to be up quarter-on-quarter kind of back to our sequential patterns that we normally see in this business",products_services,,
"From a longevity perspective, I would expect services to outpace product but not to the same degree that it has over the last several quarters",products_services,,
It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective,sales,Positive,Confident
"Gross margin wise, numbers we've been posting lately, the 63% to 64% is really what we're focused on going forward","sales,earnings",,

"Let me start with that and then I'll pass it on to you, Ken",,,
"The high-end SRX it addresses a market opportunity that's primarily geared towards telecom providers, especially in the mobile space",,,

It's going to have fluctuation depending on build outs for typically Tier 1 service providers,products_services,,

"Clearly, as the perimeter around the enterprise disappears, as workloads and applications moves to the cloud, the security architectures evolve and virtual security offerings become far more important",,,
"And we actually have a really differentiated virtual security solution â€“ the virtual SRX that is in the market, that is gaining good traction, but it's still a small market opportunity for this period of time",,,
"It's an example of innovation that, we believe, will help us in the second horizon of our strategy in the sort of two, three, four, five year timeframe",,,
"Well, let me start with the second one, and Ken, you might need to help me with this one",,,
Switching versus Routing mix in the cloud,sales,,
"Now we know that, like I have mentioned I think a couple of times on this call, the business is going to be lumpy",,,Uncertain
And it's going to be lumpy both in Switching and in Routing,,,
A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching,sales,Positive,Confident
"But in the past, there were quarters were it has actually come in more in the Routing",,,
"In terms of mix, I don't know if we provided that detail",,,
You're welcome,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Thank you,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It's honestly very difficult to answer the question, just because the volume of customers that we now have that are buying QFXs from us across all verticals is very large",,,
And I don't know if you can really put any patterns to it,,,
The one pattern sort of out there is just the 100-gig option,,,
"Where there are large data center deployments that require 100-gig connectivity, that's where Juniper just differentiates even more",,,
"This is where the density of our products, our Routing stack, the logical scale of our QFX technology starts to really stand out",products_services,,
"And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good",sales,Positive,Confident
"Now if you narrow your analysis and you look specifically on market share in the over 10-gig connectivity space, there we're taking market share even faster",,,
"And that's just again because of the fact that where there are high-performance networking problems to be solved, we tend to just stand out among our peers in the industry",,,
"Yeah, sure",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me start on the organizational piece,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I don't think I would view this from the standpoint of it being specific to any one vertical,,,Uncertain
"I just reached the conclusion that having a flatter organization will result in an ability to execute with more consistency, to move faster with fewer layers in the organization to address what is a very dynamic market opportunity",,,
"As it pertains to the cloud providers themselves, we have sort of understood the recipe for how to succeed there for quite a long period of time, where it really has to be an engagement model that is at the engineer-to-engineer level",,,
We are connected with them on a first name basis down throughout the entire organization,,,
And that's really what's required to achieve the necessary understanding of the direction of their architecture and what has enabled us to be successful,,,
Thanks James,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Your voice was kind of choppy, so I hope that I got the questions all correctly",,,
You can tell me if I didn't,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First in the virtual routing, and I'll extend that to include virtual routing, virtual security",,,
There is certainly an element of the networking industry all up that can be addressed with virtual technologies as opposed to just hardware,,,
"Typically, these are going to be more service oriented",products_services,,
They're going to be at the edge of the network,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's very difficult to solve a large core opportunity or a data center spine opportunity with just software or just virtual products,products_services,,
And that obviously is where Juniper has excelled historically,,,
It's where our differentiation mostly has existed in the past,,,
"Having said that, as the world moves towards cloud architectures and our customers have the ability to deliver services using a cloud service delivery model that presents an opportunity for us to start to offer virtual versions of our products, like virtual security being an example of that",products_services,,
"It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in",,Positive,Confident
"And from an M&A standpoint, no new news there other than we continue to look at M&A strategically as a way of accelerating the strategies that we have talked to you about in the past and we're executing on today",acquisitions,,
So we're not looking at this to get into adjacent markets,,,
We want to look at this from the standpoint of really accelerating a strategy that we are operating in today,,,
"And then last, but not least, is on the operational expenditures, Ken, I'll let you close on that",,,
Thank you,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thank you, Kathleen",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Good afternoon, everyone",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We delivered good year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Total revenue was $1.309 billion at the high end of our guidance range, with growth driven by record revenue in Switching and continued strength in the Cloud vertical",sales,Positive,Confident
"We delivered strong profitability metrics, with year-over-year growth in operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
I'm pleased with our overall performance as we continued to benefit from our diversification strategy,,,
"We're executing on our strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud, and I'm happy with the continued strength in our cloud-oriented solution across our key focus verticals",,Positive,Confident
Enterprises continued towards digital transformation by adopting hybrid cloud and SaaS models,,,
Top of mind for many of our customers are security and visibility of data and workloads in a multi-cloud environment,,,
"Telcos are going through a significant transformation as trends such as SD-WAN, 5G, IoT, and overall broadband growth are driving the need to evaluate Cloud-grade architectural shift in order to increase automation, reduce costs and enable greater service speed and agility","op_costs,products_services",Positive,Confident
"In the quarter, we unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking to accelerate agility and innovation in the cloud era",,,
"Cloud-Grade Networking builds on carrier-grade reach and reliability and enterprise-grade control and usability, bringing cloud-level agility and operational scale to networks everywhere",,,
"This announcement includes two new foundational products: Junos Node Slicing and Universal Chassis, which reduce operational overhead and create an environment for operational agility to thrive",products_services,,
"Junos Node Slicing is a critical technology in the transition to Cloud-Grade Networking and in particular, the movement to disaggregated networking at the edge",,,
"By enabling the ability to run multiple isolated services at the edge, combined with a powerful and efficient data plane, service providers and enterprises can optimize their infrastructure while offering differentiated services with enhanced operational and administrative isolation within a single chassis",products_services,,
This is enabled by converging multiple concurrent services on the same physical routing infrastructure,products_services,,
"This differentiated technology has already enabled a Tier 1 service provider network win for us, and we expect that we'll have broader impact as our customers learn about its powerful benefits",products_services,,
"Universal Chassis is a breakthrough system allowing customers to standardize on a hardware platform across their data center, core and network edge",,,
It is designed to provide customers with the ability to adapt to ever changing business requirements with a common hardware platform that supports a continuum of optimized switching and routing use cases across their network,,,
Universal Chassis can create significant value for our customers by enhancing their ROI through reduced qualification and logistics cost along with greater investment protection,"op_costs,organic_expansion",,
"Now, I would like to summarize the highlights across Switching, Routing and Security",,,
"In Switching, we saw continued momentum with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals",sales,Positive,Confident
"Two effects continued to see strong year-over-year growth in cloud data center, driven by the industry's migration towards 100-gigabit infrastructure and as our customers adopt end-to-end solutions with Juniper's ToR and spine portfolio",sales,Positive,Confident
We also saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our EX products,products_services,Positive,Confident
"In Routing, the MX had good year-over-year and sequential growth",sales,Positive,Confident
And we also saw strength in our PTX products within our cloud customers and new insertions in telecom in the second quarter,products_services,,
"In Security, we announced enhancements to our Software-Defined Secure Networks platform and expanded our public cloud offering with the introduction of virtual SRX 4.0. Our SDSN enhancements deliver pervasive security across multivendor environments, public clouds and private cloud",,,
"Juniper's SDSN platform and its ecosystem help organizations unify security for their networks, giving customers a streamlined way to integrate products and manage their security operation regardless of the vendors they choose",products_services,,
"In addition, we continue to add new logos to our Sky ATP customer portfolio",,,
"In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including a large Strategic Enterprise customer in APAC and a large telecom customer in EMEA",,,
AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management of Juniper's hardware and software,,,
"This allows us to bring the powerful machine-learning capabilities of AppFormix to our entire portfolio of products, and we are now applying this capability in various customer use cases",products_services,,
"We had another strong quarter in our services business, where we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services",products_services,Positive,Confident
"To summarize, I'm pleased with our execution and the continued momentum we are seeing in our Cloud vertical and our Switching business",,,
I am proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio and excited about the opportunity we have in front of us,products_services,,
"We saw good momentum in the first half of the year, and we anticipate delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper",,,
I also wanted to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to successfully execute on our strategy and create value for all of our stakeholders,,,
"I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail",,,
"Actually, Rod, let me start",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And then Ken, why don't you weigh in? So on the first question around growth, goes without saying we're pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year",sales,Positive,Confident
We're off to a strong start for 2017. It certainly gives us confidence that we can meet our objective of achieving revenue growth and earnings growth in 2017 all up,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Having said that, with respect to the specific verticals, remain optimistic about Cloud vertical",,,
A lot of focus inside the company at maintaining the momentum in the Cloud,,,
"However, we've always said that the Cloud vertical is going to have some lumpiness",,,
There's going to be a timing of deployment factor that we need to weigh into our overall outlook on a quarter-over-quarter basis,,,
"Telco, it's going to be more of the same",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think nothing really changes all that much either in the positive or the negative direction,,,Uncertain
The engagement level with our telco customers is very high,,,
"And it's all very much around new architectures, new ways of driving service revenues, et cetera","sales,products_services",,
"But the new mode of operation, the new build-out that drive these new modes of service delivery are just going to take some time",products_services,,
So we're not expecting anything materially different in the short term,,,
"Enterprise, there actually in Q2, we saw some good momentum with the exception of the federal government",,,
"And there, we have to see how the federal government spending plays out for the rest of the year",,,
"But generally speaking, we've done a good job in compensating for weakness in federal government with the broader enterprise",,,
"So all up, we remain optimistic about the year, and we're off to a solid start in achieving both revenue and margin growth for the full year","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Sure, Simon",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'll start with the question about Routing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And then we'll address the first question or the point of clarification you're asking about,,,
The routing market is largely driven by the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical,,,
"And those are a little bit of a tale of two cities right now where the Cloud is really spending quite a bit on their wide area networks, making sure that their customers for their Cloud services continue to get the optimal experience",products_services,,
And that involves investments in their wide area network,organic_expansion,,
"That's somewhat offset by weakness in the Telco vertical, all up, which is obviously significant factor in Routing",,,
"So yes, traffic is growing",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But there are sort of other factors at play that results in Routing from a revenue standpoint or total addressable market standpoint not growing all that well,sales,,
"Having said that, I think that there are some things that are going to be happening at some point in the future around metro buildouts, around new modes of delivering services to enterprises that leverage things like new Cloud-managed solutions to connectivity and security that we are very much engaging with our customers on today, difficult to tell exactly when that will result in actual revenue growth for us","sales,products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"But that said, we're doing everything we can right now to participate in those new modes of spend when they become a reality in the market",,,
The last thing I would say about Routing is there is a big geographic component to this,,,
China is a country that's still investing quite heavily in routing today,,,
They're driving a lot of the world's sort of wide area traffic growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"And in order for us to participate effectively in that market beyond the level that we are today, we need partnerships",,,
"And there is a, as you know, quite a bit of focus right now by the company on creating partnerships such as the one that we have with Lenovo today, that will enable us to tap into that market as effectively as possible",,,
"And just to add some color on the first question, Simona, I appreciate the question",,,
"Juniper has always been a company that has derived much of its success by focusing on those that operate the world's largest, most scalable networks",,,
And that's certainly true for our service provider on our Cloud vertical,products_services,,
"So, in some sense, due to reasons of strategy where we're focusing as a company, where our strengths lie, and the concentration of where spend is happening in our industry, concentration in our business is not new",,,
I think the timing of deployments just so happened that resulted in a little bit more concentration than usual in the Q3 timeframe,,,Uncertain
I'm not prepared at this point to provide any additional details just for reasons of confidentiality about the specific customer though however,,,
"So, Tal, I appreciate the question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're just off to a really solid start this year,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think, as you saw in the Q2 timeframe, we sort of hit the high end of our revenue range",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
Part of that had to do with sort of just timing of deployments of big projects that we have been working on,,,
"There is no change to our confidence in terms of our strategy, our ability to execute, our products that we have in the market today and the products that we're working on that we know that will be out in the market in the future",products_services,,
"And also our vertical focus, so the Cloud vertical continues to be a really important vertical for us",,,
I don't think that there's going to be any material slowdown in terms of their need to invest in their networks to keep ahead of the traffic that they are seeing on a yearly basis,,,Uncertain
But we just have to factor into all of this the timing of those deployments and the timing of the projects,,,
And I think you also mentioned Switching,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Obviously very happy with the Switching performance that we have demonstrated well ahead of our long-term model,,Positive,Confident
"I think we've said in the past, and I'll say it again just now, that expecting that level of ongoing outperformance at Switching is probably unrealistic only because the numbers start to get big",,,Uncertain
"But that said, the new products are doing really well",products_services,,
Our customer adoption is excellent,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The feedback that we're getting from our customers and our partners is also very, very encouraging and there is a lot more room for us to grow and take market share in the Switching business",,,
"Sure, Jeff",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me start,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On the question around Switching, we have expected and we have seen that Switching is in fact the main growth driver for the business",sales,Positive,Confident
I expect that to continue with the comment I just mentioned around the fact that expecting these levels of outperformance relative to our long-term model in Switching to â€“ at some point they're going to moderate,,,
"But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"All of that I would say is working really, really well for us right now",,,
"And on the point around spine switches, the main intent of our spine switching products has been to enable us to participate in and compete for net new Switching business, especially in the data center",products_services,,
And that's exactly what they're doing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So even in opportunities where we're coming in with the spine switches and, of course, our top of racks, the bulk of the revenue that we'd see could be in other areas of our portfolio like in the top-of-rack switching but we would not have an ability to compete or to win without the breadth of that portfolio",sales,,
So it's as expected and we're very pleased with the momentum thus far,,,
And I think it will continue in terms of being a growth driver for us for the rest of the year and for the foreseeable future,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
Let me address that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So Cloud-Grade Networking includes a number of different sub-products,products_services,,
One of them is really around this concept of a Universal Chassis,,,
Ken just talked about how we as a company are operating and executing with far more efficiency,,,
"It's true in our engineering group, it's true in other parts of our organization as well",,,
"Well, one of the ways in which we're achieving that is by developing fewer products that address a broader market opportunity",products_services,,
This concept of a Universal Chassis has the ability to address a number of routing or switching use cases,,,
"And it adds tremendous value for our customers because it gives them an ability to evolve their deployments, their investment protection to address a variety of different use cases as their business requires it",organic_expansion,,
"The Universal Chassis, the first iteration of it is in the market today",,,
"It's a product that supports both routing and switching, and eventually will also support edge routing capabilities as opposed to just core routing capabilities",products_services,,
"And while it's still early, typically these things take a couple of quarters, maybe nine months to get to revenue, I do expect revenue for this first iteration of Universal Chassis in the second half of this year",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And of course, the innovation engine continues to crank",,,
"So across Routing, Switching and Security, you can expect that there's going to be a number of new products that will continue this ongoing cycle of refreshes, and of course that will help us in maintaining the momentum that we've seen thus far over the last couple of years",products_services,,
"Thanks, James, both good questions",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First on the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, very, very happy with this hire",,Positive,Confident
"Just as a reminder, Bikash hasn't actually joined us yet, but we anticipate that he will in the next month",,,
"What he brings to the table are a number of different things, but I'll just sort of summarize it in a couple of different ways",,,
"First and foremost, you know that we have over the last couple of years, really honed in our strategy on what we believe is the biggest trend that is impacting our industry",,,
And that is the Cloud,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's by no means saying that this means that it's just around the hyperscalers or the cloud operators,,,
Cloud is in fact an architectural evolution that's becoming a way of life across every vertical that we participate in today,,,
"And all of our customers in these verticals, whether they be Telco, Cable, Enterprises, government and of course the hyperscalers are looking for real leadership from a product direction, from a services direction that helps them to make this transition to a cloud architecture that helps them become far more agile and to save money, just as the hyperscale providers have demonstrated can be possible",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"And of course, Bikash has been a part of that at his current employer, Google",,,
"Secondarily, I believe and I've always believed that having real technical knowledge, not just in the products themselves, but in the operation of products and the operations of networks, allow you to develop better solutions for your customers",products_services,,
And Bikash has that as well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, he has now spent a number of years running what is a large network",,,
"And that knowhow helps us in developing better solutions, I think, for all of our customer base",,,Uncertain
"Moving on to the question around Security, so yes, we would look to both organic or inorganic",organic_expansion,,
"But quite frankly, the focus right now on Security has been on achieving stability and returning to growth",sales,Positive,Confident
And that means a lot of organic work execution that's necessary to turn around this part of our business,organic_expansion,,
We continue to enhance our product offering with recent emphasis on the enterprise and the mid-range where we actually start â€“ have started to see some momentum,products_services,,
"We are getting positive data points from customers, from partners",,,
"We're seeing some geo specific momentum so, whereas, EMEA was a bit of a challenge for us in the Q2 timeframe",,,
"Actually there was momentum in Security in EMEA, which gives us some confidence that we're innovating in the right way",,,
"And very importantly, Security has become a critical element of some of these future modes of engagements with our customers",,,
"So as we talk to our customers around SD-WAN, for example, one of the really differentiating attributes of our SD-WAN solution is that it has Security embedded",,,
"So while we're starting to win opportunities in the SD-WAN space, we haven't yet seen the revenue that will help the Security number, which I anticipate we will start to see in the future",sales,,
"Once we get the stability, I think, yeah, there is certainly a possibility for us to start to look at inorganic approaches to accelerate the momentum in our business",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"But we're taking a deliberate, methodical approach right now to this part of our business",,,
"Well, so if you look at â€“ what we've done just historically, we've made a couple of acquisitions in the optical space",acquisitions,,
We believe there is an architectural inflection point where customers can achieve vast levels of cost efficiency by managing and operating their networks across packet and optical,op_costs,Positive,Confident
"And then the last one was a company called AppFormix, which is around automation, in particular, in the cloud data center, but has much broader applicability than that",,,
And that would be sort of indicative of what you might expect in the future as well,,,
I just mentioned Security,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Even in the domain of Security, I think any sort of inorganic activity that we would contemplate or explore would be more around the new modes of security, not so much of around sort of the physical perimeter firewall which is current mode",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"New mode is around enabling customers to migrate to public clouds or to hybrid cloud offerings without compromising their data, their users, their workloads",,,
"I think, there's quite a bit of innovation right now in the industry in that domain and that would be an area that we would consider as well",,,Uncertain
"Mark, first, I want to understand a little bit more about your first question",,,
"When you say dual sourcing, are you talking about the intent of cloud providers to dual source their",,,
"I mean, the Cloud vertical for us is not a new vertical",,,
"I mean, we have been in this vertical now for as long as I can remember",,,
"And we have been, sort of, intimately tied down at the engineering level with our cloud customers now for a number of years",,,
And it's always been a very competitive environment,,,
"So, by no means do I ever feel like there â€“ that we don't need to be on our toes",,,Uncertain
"We're always having to demonstrate to them how we're innovating in ways that are very, very specific to the kinds of network that they're building out, the operational models that they want to deploy, the telemetry capabilities that they want, et cetera, et cetera",,,
"And yeah, some of them do have sort of an internal strategy to go to dual vendor â€“ dual vendors to procure that technology",,,
"But even in those circumstances, our goal is to always get the lion's share by demonstrating that we can perform better or innovate in a more appropriate way for their business",,,
"On Security, and I think, the question was around whether we're driving Security products in the Cloud vertical",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"And that certainly is the case, but I will say that different cloud providers have very different security requirements and security models that they deploy inside of their networks",,,
"In some cases, they believe in the big iron that sits at the edge of their data centers, for example, and secures traffic going in and out of those data centers",,,
"For that, we have a fantastic product, our high-end SRX",products_services,,
But that business will be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on where the deployments are,,,
"In other cases, it's really more around securing through micro segmentation inside of the cloud network",,,
"And that's really more around a software approach to security, and that's more of an emerging opportunity for us at Juniper",,,
"Maybe, Kulbinder, it's worthwhile just summarizing the areas of focus that we currently have with respect to gross margins","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"First, there is opportunity when it comes to value engineering",,,
And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins,"sales,earnings,op_costs,products_services",Positive,Confident
"Secondarily, I mean, Ken has mentioned how we've gone after strategic customer insertions in particular in APAC, and we need those to pay off over time",,,
"Third, there's innovation",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And one of the questions I was just asked around where are you contemplating inorganic moves, one area I did not mention is the area of silicon photonics",organic_expansion,,
The primary reason is because we believe that there is an opportunity there through innovation to achieve better cost of goods sold from an optical standpoint,op_costs,Positive,Confident
"And last but not least, it's around business models and it's around software",,,
"It's around selling the value through Contrail, virtual security, SD-WAN",,,
"All of these emerging opportunities I think have the ability to not just help top line, but to also help gross margins","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
But they're largely going to be gated by how fast the industry moves,,,
"Now, we're out there sort of really selling the value to our customers",,,
"We're encouraged by the wins that we're getting, but it's sort of the timing of the benefit is not 100% clear at this point",,,
"Jim, let me start with the Security question first",,,
"So, I outlined the main areas of focus",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I also provided some of the data points that we are now picking up on that give us some confidence that the work that we are putting in is going to pay off for us,,,
I believe the second half and in particular Q4 would be sort of a quarter that I would expect to start seeing some year-over-year growth in the security market,sales,Positive,Confident
So that's how I view the opportunity right now in Security and how we are expecting the rest of year to pan out,,,
"And Ken, do you want to talk a little bit more about gross margins?","sales,earnings",,
Okay,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Paul, let me start with the second one, the Tier 1 versus broader Cloud",,,
"We don't break it out, first of all, but I will say the following",,,
Our penetration in the Tier 1s from a Routing standpoint is one that has been in place now for a number of years,,,
So we've certainly had way more runway and way more of an ability to achieve the kinds of penetration across our Tier 1 Cloud customers in the Routing space more so than we've had on the Switching side of things,,,
"In Switching, we view it as more of an opportunity",,,
"We certainly have a strong Tier 1 presence in Switching, but we have less market share and penetration than we do in Routing",,Positive,Confident
"And, therefore, that's certainly a potential growth area for us",sales,Positive,Confident
"In the meantime, I think what I have said on this call in the past is that there is a broader opportunity in the cloud space, not necessarily with the hyperscalers, but the broader cloud market when you look at SaaS providers, regional cloud providers, telco cloud that's here now that we are benefiting from",,,Uncertain
"I mean, a lot of our business momentum in fact is from that tier of cloud provider",,,
And I think that's a very healthy thing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Price erosion, again, is not something that is easy to describe without a whiteboard and some slides",,,
We can certainly do something like that maybe at our next Analyst Day,,Neutral,Uncertain
But it's the nature of this business that we're in,,,
"Every time a new port speed is introduced into the market, as it achieves mass adoption, you will expect, as we would do, that pricing will start to go down and it offsets the benefit that you would get from the traffic growth alone in the market",sales,Positive,Confident
"So all up, the Routing space is roughly a sort of a flattish type of total addressable market from a growth standpoint, but traffic is growing at 40% plus year-over-year",sales,Positive,Confident
So that would give you an idea of the price erosion that we're seeing in that market space,,,
"In the data center switching side, there of course, there is price erosion just as there is everywhere",,,
"However, I think that market is growing at a faster clip than in the data center and that's why we are so focused on data center switching as part of our strategy",,,Uncertain
"Thank you, Steve",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First from the standpoint of hyperscalers, I think we acknowledge that this is a competitive market and especially as we demonstrate the momentum and the success, we can expect that the competitive levels to only intensify",,,Uncertain
"Having said that, I think it really is just a matter of execution for us, execution from the standpoint of how we engage with them, execution from the standpoint of our innovations and on all fronts, I feel good about where we are and where we're going relative to the hyperscaler opportunity, in addition to the broad Cloud opportunity that is before us",,,Uncertain
"And as far as Cisco's announcement, I have been now for two or three years talking about automation as being the next big thing in networking",,,
There's a very important reason for that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

DRAM shipments grew 24% sequentially in dollar terms and made up 23% of system shipments,,,

"We've been working with the UK competition regulator to secure approval of the transaction, and we're really pleased as they have accepted in principle our proposed solution to address their one concern regarding the LINK ATM scheme",competition,Positive,Confident
And we're now looking forward to working with the regulator for final approval of that solution,,,
"We expect to close the transaction sometime in the spring of 2017. So now, let's move on to a few highlights from 2016 and some of our recent business activity",,,
"Overall, 2016 was a year that had its economic and regulatory challenges, but I think we've navigated those successfully while putting significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital, in safety and security, in data analytics, loyalty and processing",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"This last quarter, we continued our momentum in the US, pleased to have renewed a number of deals including SunTrust Bank for their credit, debit and commercial business, which, by the way, includes Labs as a service to help drive their innovation agenda, as well as the First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private banks in the US, for their credit and commercial portfolios",products_services,Positive,Confident
"In addition, we've given you several examples in the past as to how we've been extending our capabilities beyond switching into processing, back to Warren's clarification, enabling us to drive more deals and touch more transactions",,,

"Outside of the US, we're continuing to make significant progress as well",,,
"In Europe â€“ I'm just giving you a few examples by the way â€“ in Europe, we signed Amazon for their credit co-brand business in the UK, renewed our debit agreement with ABN AMRO, one of the largest banks in the Netherlands",,,
"In Latin America, we signed a new deal with Caixa in Brazil for credit and debit, which also includes Advisor services",products_services,,
"Additionally, we renewed agreements with Bancolombia for credit and debit with a focus on affluent, as well as with Santander in Mexico for credit, debit and commercial, and a flip of their commercial business in Brazil, while in Asia we renewed our agreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the largest bank in that country",,,
"Finally, while discussing these, let me touch on the domestic opportunity for China",,,
"We continue to speak with the regulators there to better understand the entry requirements, and to clarify our options and how best to approach that market",,,
"In the meanwhile, what we're doing is focusing on driving single branded card issuance",,,
"We're pleased to add Bank of China this quarter, bringing the total number of programs for single branded card issuance launched in 2016 to 44, with more than 10 banks",,,
All of these are aimed at driving cross-border spend with the country's growing affluent segment,,,
So let me move on to digital,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As we've often said, that this is a marathon not a sprint",,,
"But I believe we are executing well against our strategy, and have made some good progress in 2016, and starting at Masterpass, where we continue to focus on driving both user adoption and acceptance",,,
"We've talked to you about our Digital by Default strategy, which basically enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders through their online banking app, and helps to drive scale, but at the same time keeps the issuer at the center of their consumer relationship",,,
"We're pleased to have achieved our stated goal of enabling 80 million accounts by the end of 2016. The services have been rolled out globally with several banks, including Bank of America, Capital One, Citi, Nordea, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia",products_services,Positive,Confident
"With a healthy pipeline to build on this momentum in 2017, we've also added five new Masterpass markets in 2016, bringing the total to 34. Last year, Masterpass became the first digital payment service to work across all devices and channels, which helped drive acceptance and enabled consumers to shop online, in-store, or in app using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice",products_services,,
"So from an acceptance standpoint, we've added roughly 80,000 new merchants, bringing the total to about 340,000 for online and in-app purchases, as well as more than 6 million locations in about 80 countries that allow contactless payments",,,
"This quarter, we're pleased to announce partnerships with Dunkin' Donuts, Walgreens, Gulf Oil, Wyndham Hotels, and so on",,,
"Last quarter, we highlighted our agreement with the Ecobank Group to roll out Masterpass QR",,,
That's a mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries,products_services,,

"This past year, we highlighted our partnership with Green Dot and Uber, Stripe and Lyft as well as Allstate, and how they are using the platform to make convenient and secure payments to drivers, delivery people, and claimants, among others",,,
"This quarter we added Wells Fargo Bank, who will leverage Mastercard Send for their treasury and merchant services customers","products_services,organic_expansion",,
So let's keep going a little bit with the partnerships in digital,,,
"This past year, we helped Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay and Microsoft Wallet to expand to several new countries",,,
"We've added Spain, Ireland, Poland, Russia, and Hong Kong, bringing the total to 17 markets around the globe where consumers can use one or more of these services",products_services,,
"We also enabled several of them to allow their consumers to shop online, in-app, and check out using their same MDES tokenized login credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where Masterpass is accepted",,,
"And by doing that, obviously this also benefited our merchant partners, as they did not have to do any additional development work to support these services",products_services,,
"Finally, as part of the innovation agenda, we've been looking at ways to combine digital payments with artificial intelligence to create better and more personalized experiences for consumers",,,
"And to give you an example, this past year we launched an AI bot platform, which is similar to human interaction and enables consumers to buy products via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and check out using Masterpass",products_services,,
"So building on that theme of AI, we've also launched Decision Intelligence, one of our safety and security products which uses machine learning to score transactions based on an individualized risk profile in order to reduce false declines, while at the same time mitigating potential fraud","products_services,op_risks",Negative,NIL
That brings me to services,products_services,,
"And remember, our focus on services is in delivering capabilities that connect right back to our core business, providing great value and competitive differentiation to our clients while giving us an incremental revenue stream","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
I think we've made significant progress in this area in the prior year,,,Uncertain
"Still, let me quickly run through a few examples, starting with safety and security, which has been a key area of focus for us this past year",,,
"We continued the rollout of our leading biometric authentication product, Identity Check, fondly known as selfie pay, to 16 markets around the world, in addition to the launch of Decision Intelligence, which I just mentioned",products_services,,
"On the data analytics front, since the acquisition of APT, we've integrated the sales and product organizations at APT with Advisors to drive significant benefits","sales,products_services,acquisitions",,
We've added more than 60 organizations who have subscribed to the APT platform in recurring subscription-based contracts,,,
"So in addition to McDonald's, which we mentioned in the past, we got JCPenney and Duracell in the US, Asahi Breweries in Japan, Thomas Cook in the UK",,,
"In fact, there were 28 deals in total that were additive to APT's business as usual efforts",,,
"So with assets like these, we not only deliver great insight, we're actually building even stronger relationships with our merchant partners as well",,Positive,Confident
"So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics",,,
"Yes, I absolutely am",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Remember that in the retail business alone, the consumer to retail payments, 85% of the world's retail payments are still cash and check",,,
"So, there's a lot of opportunity there, first; second, there's the whole commercial space that's got a great deal of opportunity that we've been assiduously building on; third, we've got our services revenue; and fourth, we've actually beginning to participate in the direct to bank account payments once the VocaLink acquisition is complete","sales,products_services,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"So, to me, we're building the right portfolio to take on the opportunities that this secular growth represents over the next decade, not just one or two years",sales,Positive,Confident

"Now, what that means specifically for a company like ours, or for merchants or for banks who are in our ecosystem, I don't yet know, because you'll only get to know that over a period of time",,,

They'll end up winning on some and losing on some,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I just don't know which ones will go where,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I do know that in an environment which talks about regulation being something you need to watch carefully so that you enact the right kind of regulation, but you don't stifle innovation and growth, that could lead to definitely a constructive view",sales,Positive,Confident
That's kind of where I'm coming from,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I don't yet know, specifically, how it will impact our company or those in our immediate ecosystem",,,
"I do believe that in the space of infrastructure, there will be some form of investment or the other funded in some form or the other into infrastructure, both physical and digital, in our country",organic_expansion,,
I believe that will only increase the velocity of money in the country,,,
"That will be helpful for a company like ours, both in retail and commercial payments",,,
"So, I look forward actually to that, both as a direct impact on our company, but also, frankly, traveling the way I do and the way most of you do, the infrastructure in our country could do with the benefit of a sustained investment program, both in physical and digital",organic_expansion,,
"So, I think that's important",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The aspects of taxes, there's all kinds of discussions floating around about what kind of tax rate",,,
I'm talking corporate taxes right now,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"What kind of corporate tax rates could come to if it comes down from the current level that we're paying, which as Martina told you, 28%, 29%",,,
"If it comes down to anything below that, you should expect us as a company to benefit from it directly to the bottom line",earnings,Negative,NIL
There's rumors that it will go to 20% or 25%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
You can put your own probability factor on which one,,,
"I think there's lots of things to be worked out about how you pay for that reduction in taxes and what impact that has, border taxes, adjustments of import and export circumstances",,,Uncertain
All of these have implications for us as a company,,,
"Mostly we are a net exporter of service rather than a net importer of service as a company, because of the fact that so much of our back office and our technology and our product development has historically been developed in the United States with US IP",products_services,,
We do have a lot overseas,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We do have stuff in Asia,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We do have stuff in Dublin and Europe, but net, I think you will find us to be a net exporter rather than a net importer",,,Uncertain
"So I guess on all of those aspects on taxes to regulatory to infrastructure, I can find ourselves finding this to be net positive for our company over the next four to five years",,,
"The aspects of trade, Tien-Tsin, as you know, my normal approach to trade is that I continue to believe that the United States is way too large a marketplace for companies and businesses to feel that they shouldn't be involved with having on-soil presence and on-soil activity and frequent travel in and out by business executives alike",,,Uncertain
"So, I consider the US to be too attractive for that to change dramatically",,,
"I do believe like everybody else that in the corporate world, there are a lot of us have built our business on the freer flow of cross-border trade, data and people",,,
"If that were to change over time, that would be a problem, but I don't believe that that's what the administration wants to do",,,
They want to grow the economy,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The economy is not going to grow without the right inputs in the right places,,,
"It may change specifics of the way trade gets enacted, but I continue to be relatively bullish on where this economy could go over the next four to five years",,,
"Don't ask questions again, man",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, the interchange changes have already gone, and as you know, some time back, and so have all the other rules that went with it, including the co-badging",,,
And that's why there's an Article 8 and Article 7 implications,,,
"They're all baked into our earnings calls for the last two, three quarters",earnings,,
"First of all, I actually am beginning to see an expansion in acceptance, for sure, across the EU, probably facilitated by the lower interchange rates that merchant who earlier were reluctant to accept electronic payments are now willing to do so",organic_expansion,,
That's a good thing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
There is obviously an impact on bank P&Ls caused by the lower interchange rates,,,
"Every bank, as you know, is working on other ways to find ways to get to their P&L again",,,
That includes fees,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It includes services,products_services,,
It includes alternative products,products_services,,
It includes an emphasis on commercial in some cases,,,
There's a whole series of actions that banks in different countries across Europe have been taking to try and find a way to put some energy back into their P&L,,,
"My sense on the other aspects, PSD2, as you know, it's still two or three years away from fully being implemented",,,
2018 is when it starts hitting the road,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
But there's a lot of energy and a lot of passion going into preparing for it,,,
I actually believe that VocaLink could play a very instrumental role for banks in the EU to help them actually find a way to navigate through PSD2 and to maintain scheme-like look and feel to the ability to create payments in a way that they can manage through their customer relationships and their chargebacks and their fraud management and the like,,,Uncertain

"So, I continue to believe that the entire services space, remember, there's a set of different businesses inside it",products_services,,
"So, there's safety and security, there's Advisors in the consulting business",,,
There's the information services and data analytical space,products_services,,
"There's the space of loyalty and rewards and there's processing, which actually allows us to get a role to play in many of the other services we want to be participating in",products_services,,
They've all got different growth rates and trajectories,sales,Positive,Confident
"Safety and security happens to be one of the fastest growing, along with information and data analytics",,,
"That's because one, they're intertwined, but two, that's a very important topic right now for consumers, merchants and banks",,,
"And I believe we have cutting-edge products that are differentiated and are capable of helping institutions across the world plug in and help them manage potential fraud while work on declines, and so help them really maximize their P&L in attractive ways when they're looking for revenue","sales,products_services",Negative,NIL
"So, I continue to believe those two will be very attractive growth areas over the next five to ten years",sales,Positive,Confident
"Our processing grows when we win deals, but processing, and when we get into more footprints, processing tends to be a very local business",,,
"It has some global transferability, but it tends to be quite local",,,
"And therefore, it tends to have also a different margin profile than safety and security and information analytics because local means you've got to build locally and that creates its own expense profile","sales,earnings,op_costs",,
We also tend to make more money out of the transactions we see rather than in the processing business itself,,,
"So, it tends to be a input into deal winning rather than part of the revenue cycle as much as the others",sales,,
The loyalty business is actually very interesting,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We started with a relatively good platform in MasterCard Rewards,,,
We've added to it over the years with merchant funded rewards by buying into Truaxis in California and buying into Pinpoint in Australia,,,
We're actually getting some nice wins in that space and we continue to believe that the loyalty and rewards space will be a good growth area and a good sticky area with our customers,sales,Positive,Confident
"So, do I see this as being a relatively attractive growth area, a faster percentage of growth than our core business? Probably, because it's off a smaller base as well",sales,Positive,Confident
"Do I see this changing dramatically over the next couple of years? No, but beyond that, we'll see",,,
This is a live area,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're investing in it both organically and inorganically, so it's kind of a live growing segment for us",organic_expansion,,
"And those PIN transactions go up and down, as we've told you a few times",,,
There's months and quarters when they are growing faster,,,
"That tends to be a more, it's almost a weekly and daily issue that we deal with",,,
"But, if you're talking about generally long-term trends, you should expect that the two will grow faster than the other two",,,
"The fact is that even at 8% or 10%, core payment transaction growth of 8% or 10% is attractive",sales,Positive,Confident
That reflects the secular change as well as all the day-to-day activities that Martina just referred to,,,
"Well, there have been for years in the industry these alternative payment schemes to the global networks",,,
"In fact, I used to say that our competition is not just the global networks",competition,,

"Cartes Bancaires in France, for example, is owned by the French banks",,,
They play different roles,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
They play roles where they will look at all the debit transactions locally,,,
"Others, like CUP, all domestic transactions are mandated to go through them, and so on",,,
"So, there's a whole range of these",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"What we've been trying to do is to go back into marketplaces that we believe that the existence of these schemes is, one, either creating an imbalance in the market or holding back growth, and attempt to either work with the government or the banks to find ways to either partner with those schemes or find ways to change the laws around those schemes so that you can have a more open marketplace, which should benefit merchants and should benefit banks and should benefit consumers",sales,Neutral,NIL
And we've had different degrees of success over the years,,,
"The European Union, as you know, through its directives over the years in PSD and â€“ what is it called, the other one? The European Special?",,,
"I get mixed up between SEPA and SIPA (51:07); but, SEPA",,,
Those have created opening up of these schemes for people like us to be able to play,,,
I continue to believe that the model will be a mix of all of those,sales,,
"The one you're specifically getting at is more like the Russian model, where there is a domestic payment scheme generated and created, and we have helped them put their technology together and connect with them and provide services that are value added from safety, security, cross-border approvals, transaction management to information and data, which are provided by our better capable systems than they have of their own",products_services,Neutral,NIL
And the fact that we see global transactions and they tend to see localized transactions adds a long-term value differentiator between what we can provide and what a local scheme can provide,,,
It's the same with the RuPays of the world or others,,,
"We're always looking for ways to cooperate with them, in some cases successfully, in others not so",,,
I'm sorry it's not a clear answer because this is not a clear space,,,
It's a space that evolves and breathes and lives every day and week depending on the circumstances of a marketplace,,,

I'm not saying you can't solve for it organically and try and build it,organic_expansion,,

"I think the second point is the nature of the data flows; now this is a little bit more in the commercial B2B payment space, the nature of the data flows that come back-and-forth over VocaLink's B2B payment enabled system is such that you get their ISO 20022 dealer standard",,,Uncertain

But I'll tell you a different picture about it which I think you'll be more interested in,,,Uncertain
My view is that a consumer must get choice at the front end of their decision of how to pay and that choice should be connected back to where their bank relationship comes from,,,
"And if that choice is to pay by direct debit to their bank account or by the inward receipt of a remittance through a friend, a relative or a government disbursement or with a debit card or a prepaid card or a credit card, that concept of choice is what we're trying to put together when I was describing the opportunity with Fast ACH as well as what we have, which is Mastercard Send and HomeSend and our card rails",,,
"Whether you â€“ pay by bank has only one way of choosing right now, which is from your bank account",,,
I visualize that as being important and an interesting application not just in the UK but in other markets as well,,,
"It can lead to some good volume growth, but what I also visualize over time is the choice coming across to a consumer at the point-of-sale on their phone or from the terminal, whichever way, a choice to make payments from these alternative funding sources",sales,Positive,Confident
That's what I think is where all this is going,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I continue to believe that the opportunity in B2B for ACH and therefore VocaLink type of Fast ACH payments is enormous,,,
It's way beyond what a Mastercard Send or card rails can address,,,
Why is that? Card rails requires you to have card acceptance with all these merchants on both side or the businesses on both sides of a B2B transaction,,,
"And while you can attempt to build that acceptance and we have built it over the years, we're actually building in a number of markets around the world",,,
"But I would say while that addresses a portion of the opportunity, there is a much bigger opportunity that lies outside of that portion",,,
That outside of that portion opportunity you can address a part of it through the tools of a Mastercard Send combined with a HomeSend because you've got multiple distribution points you could reach,,,
But even now you don't have the right data and connectivity to the ERP systems of these B2B businesses that you can get with an ISO 20022 certified data standard system like VocaLink,,,
That's the real difference,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

So I'll give you a number for the United Kingdom,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In the UK alone, VocaLink's domestic real-time platform carries over last year about 1.4 billion transactions per annum and the combined value of that is $1.5 trillion",,,
Whatever you can look at addressing through card rails and through the equivalent of Mastercard Send rails would be a fraction of that number,,,
"Now, to be clear, the revenue dynamics and the challenges of building that's out, I'm not discounting any of those",sales,,
Please don't assume that by next quarter I'm going to have the worlds answer to B2B payments,,,
"I'm going to build it, but what I've got now is the right set of tools between card rails, Send, HomeSend and Fast ACH and as we get together and roll these out sensibly, in sensible profitable ways across the world, you should see us bringing choice and data capability through this to the front end of a B2B business",earnings,Positive,Confident
"Just keep this in mind, it's about choice, both commercial enterprises as well as for consumers and all I'm trying to do is to have the repertoire that allows us to do that in a sensible, practical way",,,
"Next question, please?",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, Martina, didn't send you an email on the side asking you to ask me an India question because of my poking her on Germany, right? I'm just guessing",,,
"But the India opportunity, so there are close to 850 million debit cards in that market",,,
"A large number of them, by the way, are still used essentially for taking cash out from an ATM",,,
"It's only a smaller number of them that are used at the point-of-sale and credit cards are way smaller than the debit cards, we're talking about a fraction of those",,,
"Those, of course, used at point-of-sale",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"There's little cash take out on those, although there is some",,,
"And when you put that together, you get a market that has lots of cards, more than they ever had, but still with a huge opportunity in the front of it",,,
The second side of it is the acceptance methodology,,,
"Whether it's card payment or pay by a QR code or pay by a phone or a fingerprint and all those options are being developed by different players in India, including us",,,
I think what you'll find is that this is only as good as how the acceptance market in India evolves,,,Uncertain
"Now, the acceptance market is growing rapidly in the sense that over the course of this last eight, nine months, you've had a 70%, 80% growth in merchants",sales,Positive,Confident

"Now, a large number of those are going to be fruit sellers and casual merchants who I don't yet know how we will get to create electronification, although we probably could over time",,,
But there's still a large number there that should get into acceptance expansion,organic_expansion,,
"Now, the acquiring community in India is actually pretty good at growing the acceptance",,,
Their challenge has been in the past the risk underwriting capability compared to their business model because all the acquirers in India are actually issuing banks as well and their business model is not clear until the revenue dynamics of their business model is clarified by the Reserve Bank of India,"sales,op_risks",,
"For the last few months now, since the demonetization, there has been a dispute going on about the level of MDR that the banks will make out of the system",,,
"If you don't clarify that, you're going to find a lack of appetite on the part of the players there to grow acceptance",,,
It's got nothing to do with Visa and Mastercard going into the market acquiring or not,,,
We ourselves won't know what our revenue model will be or what our profitability model will be till we get clarity on the pricing model in the marketplace,"sales,earnings",,
That pricing model was supposed to have been clarified a couple of months back,,,
I think there have been recommendations made by the Reserve Bank of India to the Indian government,,,Uncertain

I am hopeful they will finalize that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I raised that recently in a public meeting with the Prime Minister as well,,,
I know they're working through a number of puts and takes to figure it out,,,
"Once they do, I think back to the earlier question Lisa asked me about QR codes, I think you will see between traditional terminals, mobile as a point-of-sale and QR codes with dongles, I mean, mobile is a point-of-sale in dongles, and QR codes, I think you will see a reasonably strong expansion of acceptance in India",organic_expansion,Positive,Uncertain
"And people like us and our competitors, we can focus on enabling banks and merchants to make sense out of this opportunity",,,
"Remember, there's one big impetus coming, which is the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax called GST in India",products_services,,
"That GST has levels and slabs, but most commodities are at 28%",,,
People will be paying that 28% when they receive goods in a merchant shop,,,
A merchant is no longer incented to help a consumer not pay taxes because they are most likely to have paid a relatively high tax rate on receiving those goods from their supplier,,,
And therefore subsidizing that to a consumer by helping to avoid taxes is probably something that we should see reducing over the next few years,,,
"And that, to me, is the real change in the (59:02) in this place",,,
"So if we can get our stuff together in the MDR, get the acceptance expansion going, build the right digital tools and QR tools, and roll those out, while also not losing focus on cards, I think there is a really interesting opportunity over the next five to seven years in India",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain

"20-nanometer products were greater than half of CNBU revenue and were shipped primarily in the enterprise, cloud and client segments","sales,products_services",,
revenue growth in the enterprise segment was driven by the continued expansion of DRAM content per server,sales,Positive,Confident
"And in the cloud space, we experienced good sequential bit growth",sales,Positive,Confident
Both segments also benefited from the current pricing environment,,,
We saw ongoing growth of our 20-nanometer DDR4 products with particular strength coming from the latest industry server platforms,products_services,Positive,Confident
"In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 products","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
We also continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio,,Positive,Confident
This strength was primarily evident in data center networking equipment,,,
"Double-digit client revenue growth was driven by a continued firm pricing environment and product mix optimization, resulting in modestly declining bit shipments","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
Our 1X nanometer revenue was predominantly in this segment,sales,,

Moving to overall company results,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $5.6 billion, up 20% sequentially and driven by primarily stronger DRAM ASPs and higher NAND bit volumes",sales,Positive,Confident
"On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 92%, primarily due to a stronger DRAM pricing environment, increased bit volumes in both DRAM and NAND and our focus on higher value-add solutions to improve our product mix","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident

"DRAM non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased 10 percentage points sequentially to 54%, driven by a 6% cost per bit reduction and better product mix","sales,earnings,op_costs,products_services",,
"As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 DRAM bit output would be about 10% higher than first half fiscal year 2017. As we look forward into fiscal 2018, the timing of the 1x technology transition is expected to result in our bit growth at or slightly below industry growth rates over the same period",sales,Positive,Confident
We consider this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGR earlier this year,sales,Positive,Confident
"Trade NAND revenue increased 21% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a 17% increase in bit shipments and a 3% increase in ASPs",sales,,

"As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 bit growth would be about 30% above first half fiscal year 2017. Based on the timing of technology transitions, we foresee relatively muted bit growth in the first half of fiscal 2018 follow by stronger growth in the second half",sales,Positive,Confident
"Consistent with DRAM, we considered this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGRs earlier in the year",sales,Positive,Confident
"Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $600 million, down $12 million from the prior year quarter",op_costs,Negative,NIL
The company generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in fiscal Q3 compared to $389 million in the year ago period,,,
"During the quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion as we retired approximately $1 billion of debt via a tender offer for certain of our high-yield notes",debt,,
We currently expect fiscal year 2017 free cash flow of approximately $3 billion and continue to prioritize the deployment of our cash flow toward advancing our production technology capabilities and reducing our debt,"products_services,debt",,
"For fiscal year 2017, we are trending to the upper end of our indicated net CapEx range of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion",organic_expansion,,

We've been reporting our incremental progress each quarter,,,
"However, I wanted to share the tremendous progress we've made over the 12-month period ending in fiscal Q3. During that time, our bit output has been above industry average for both DRAM and trade NAND and our cost per bit has declined approximately 25% and 30% in those technologies respectively",op_costs,Negative,NIL

"But relative to the gigs shift or volume shift into the PC segment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we did have a slight decline in unit volume",,,
"It wasn't very significant at all, but that was part of our plan to address higher value-added markets",,,
"I don't think it was reflective of a decreased demand environment in any way, shape or form",,,Uncertain
"We don't typically comment on the going forward pricing environment, other than the general statement that we see fairly good balance between supply and demand",,,
And we're going to continue to monitor that segment quite carefully from a bit growth perspective,sales,Positive,Confident
"I think we're thinking that that segment would somewhere be in the range of plus low to mid-single digits in aggregate for us in fiscal '17 and I think that that addresses the three points you raised but if not, please let us know",,,Uncertain
"In terms of driving our growth ahead, of course, we have several tools available to us",sales,Positive,Confident
"Our technology and product capabilities, our engagement with customers and our ability on the manufacturing side in terms of implementing the new technologies into production",products_services,,
"We would never rule out any M&A, if and when appropriate, we would absolutely consider it, but it would have to be something that does provide ROI",acquisitions,,
So we just want to make sure that we focus on our priorities,,,
"And our priorities at this point are to strengthen our strategy and product execution and increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio mix, while engaging with customers on defining the future generation architectures",products_services,,
"So again, I don't rule out any M&A, but it of course always has to be considered in the context of what value it brings and what ROI it brings",acquisitions,,
We've mentioned earlier in the year that one of the biggest variables in terms of the quarterly level of OpEx is something we call pre-qual expense,op_costs,,
So as we are going through the process of qualifying either new packages or new technologies for customers those carry with them significant expenses,op_costs,,
"When we went into this fiscal year, we suggested that they would be more heavily weighted toward the front part of the first year and you've seen that play out here as our operating expenses have flattened out",op_costs,,
"As we look forward, we're considering OpEx as part of our fiscal year 2018 planning process and we're not quite through that",,,
So I think we'll be in a position to share a little bit more color on that with you on the next call,,,Uncertain
"But we are, as always, very mindful of operating expenses and operating expense progression",op_costs,Positive,Confident
So we're taking a very close look at that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So consistent with one of the earlier answers, we are in the middle of our planning process for fiscal â€™18 and certainly as we look at some of the priorities of the company, they have always been highly centered around continuing to drive our costs down",op_costs,Negative,NIL
"So, despite the fact that we have been, to some degree, mindful of in the context of the cash flow of the company in the past, weâ€™re going to continue to do the right thing and be prudent and disciplined in that regard",,,
We have ample opportunity to reduce the debt profile of the company,debt,,
So I appreciate your thinking we're flush with cash,,,Uncertain
We're still not as flush as I would like to be,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So that's going to continue to be a priority of â€“ about generating that free cash flow, as well as reducing the debt",debt,,
"So consistent with our prepared remarks, those are the two things we're focused on",,,
And you will continue to see us be very thoughtful in how we pursue both of those here as we enter our fiscal year 2018.,,,
"We certainly do think that that will, as it gets launched it will be driving greater demand, certainly for bits, yes",,,Uncertain
I would expect it to be increasing over time,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think it's important to remember that was a long-term target, and that there are years where we've been below, there are other years where we've been above",,,Uncertain
And so I don't know that relative to a long-term target that we would be prepared to be making any changes at this point,,,
"But by the same token - and if we do, certainly as we did earlier last year, will share that with you",,,
But at present time that target remains the same,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Bear in mind that it is a long-term target,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, I think as we noted, we are making progress every single quarter with penetrating higher value-added solutions",,,Uncertain
"And we would expect, if we are successful in continuing to execute on that, that we would be in a position to have greater revenue from those segments which may, depending on the pricing environment, to some degree mitigate a little bit the bit growth profile",sales,Positive,Confident
"But bear in min, John, that we talked about our bit growth in context of an industry that we were estimating",sales,Positive,Confident
"But we also used the words at or slightly below, not materially below",,,
So I do think it's important to keep that in mind,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And on the NAND front, we just simply said we would have a little slower growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year",sales,Positive,Confident
I wouldn't expect that we were going to be dramatically different or so underperforming the industry that it would disadvantage the company,,,
"And Jagadish just add to that, I would refer you back to some of the 2 year cost reduction CAGR we've provided at our Analyst Day, which gives you a view of fiscal â€˜17 and â€˜18 together",op_costs,,
So that might be helpful to you as well as you think about that,,,Uncertain
We think that the channel inventories are well within the range that we would considered to be normal,,,Uncertain
"Certainly, they have improved from a quantity point of view over the first part of this year when they were extremely, extremely short",,,
"But in aggregate, I think that - we think that channel inventory levels are still within healthy ranges",,,Uncertain
J,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
", we think the industry for calendar '18 could be slightly higher than the range of growth in calendar '17 which is 15% to 20%",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
So maybe add a couple of percentage points to either end of the range,,Neutral,Uncertain
And we haven't shared yet bit crossover for 1x,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We've said we have meaningful output by end of fiscal year,,,
We're clearly on track to do that and we'll provide more perspective on that as we more fully describe our 2018 plans,,,
"So just to make sure we're on the same page, we have given a range this year of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion",,,
And we said we were trending toward that $5.2 billion range,,,
So it's just a couple of hundred million dollars,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And I would say that really there is no specific area that I would point you toward,,,
It's just doing what we need to do to make sure we are well set up here as we exit the end of the fiscal year,,,

Client SSD attach rates continue to increase,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And although storage density growth has slowed temporarily due to a tight pricing environment, we foresee longer term demand for higher density SSDs",sales,Positive,Confident
We made substantial progress in growing our relationships and our business with cloud and hyperscale customers in fiscal 2017. Cloud data center customers are seeking innovative memory and storage solutions tailored to their workloads,,,
"Micronâ€™s unique capabilities and expertise in DRAM, 3D NAND and emerging memory technologies make us a compelling partner for these customers",,,

"We strengthened our leadership position in automotive in fiscal 2017, with growth driven by increasing connectivity and electronics content in vehicles",sales,Positive,Confident
Automotive applications continue to require leading edge performance,,,
"As a result, we have seen significant ramp of our 20-nanometer DDR and LPDDR technologies this quarter and began sampling automotive-grade 1X DRAM to meet these needs",,,
The growth in edge analytics in both industrial and consumer connected home applications led to record quarterly revenues in both segments,sales,Positive,Confident
"We saw strong growth through the year of our NAND and LPDDR MCP products, driven by form factor and performance needs in applications like machine-to-machine communications, surveillance, drones and home automation",products_services,Positive,Confident

"Moving on to the demand and supply fundamentals, we expect the industry to remain moderately undersupplied for the rest of 2017 for both DRAM and NAND",,,
"We see DRAM industry supply bit growth of about 20% in calendar 2017 and expect it to grow at relatively similar levels in calendar 2018. The DRAM industry supply demand balance is expected to stay healthy throughout calendar 2018, driven in part by ongoing strength in data center and cloud computing trends",sales,Positive,Confident
We expect Micronâ€™s fiscal 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be slightly below the industry growth rate,sales,Positive,Confident
"Our bit growth is supported by our 1X DRAM ramp, which represented mid-teens percent of our DRAM bit output in Q4 and will grow throughout the next several quarters to achieve bit output crossover as we exit calendar year 2018. We expect industry NAND bit supply growth to finish calendar 2017 in the high 30% range",sales,Positive,Confident
"At these levels, supply remains below demand, which has created a constrained environment",,,
"As the industry continues to transition to 64-layer 3D NAND, we estimate industry bit supply growth in calendar 2018 will approach the 50% range, which should better satisfy the current unfulfilled demand",sales,Positive,Confident
We expect that Micronâ€™s ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND in fiscal 2018 will result in bit output growth that is somewhat higher than the industry range,sales,Positive,Confident
"In fiscal Q4, 64-layer NAND represented mid-teens percent of our trade NAND bit output and we expect to achieve bit output crossover during the second half of our fiscal 2018. The dynamic industry transition to 3D NAND is taking place in the context of a NAND market that has consistently exhibited demand elasticity",,,
"We expect this behavior to continue for the foreseeable future as higher-density SSD solutions increasingly displace HDDs in client computing, cloud data centers and enterprise environments and as average capacities continue to grow with more performance-sensitive, storage-hungry devices and applications in mobile and other end markets",,,
"These trends support our view that NAND demand drivers will remain healthy into 2018. As I begin my first new fiscal year as CEO, I would like to outline our strategic priorities",,,
"First, we are focused on driving our cost competitiveness to best-in-class levels, primarily by accelerating the percentage of our output on leading edge technology, in both DRAM and NAND",op_costs,,

"So, we remain very bullish about the DRAM market environment through the 2017. We think it will be undersupplied",,,Uncertain
"And given the demand trends, we think we will have healthy demand supply balance in DRAM throughout 2018 timeframe as well",,,Uncertain
"And in terms of NAND as itâ€™s well-known that average capacities are increasing certainly in mobile devices, but even more importantly, SSDs are displacing HDDs at the rapid pace with the attach rates continuing to be projected to be going up over the course of next several quarters",,,
"And of course, there is a strong value proposition for SSDs in the cloud and hyperscale data center environment as well given all the trends of artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of this is driving big data analytics",,Positive,Confident
"So, all these trends are related to artificial intelligence, bit growth in data customers wanting to offer differentiated value to their end customers, all of this is driving need for memory and storage solution and overall, we remain pretty bullish about the demand trends",sales,Positive,Confident
"I mean, if they look at DRAM as well as NAND even in autonomous vehicle, the demand requirements for flash, I mean data is being generated",,,

"So, I will let Ernie comment on the CapEx, but on the demand side, as I pointed out earlier, I mean itâ€™s not that this demand is perishable, I mean this demand in terms of the trend of SSDs replacing HDDs in client notebook computers where the attach rate continues to increase in 2017 attach rate of SSDs to PCs is around 35%",organic_expansion,,
That attach rate over the course of next few years continues to grow to around 50% in 2018 and by 2020 timeframe expect it to go to around 75%,,,

"Yes, some of this product enablement CapEx is related to back-end captive assembly operations, which will help us improve our cost position going forward","op_costs,products_services,organic_expansion",,

"Sure, Chris",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I think as has been the case for a few quarters now, there is actually a fair amount of tightness across those three channels that you mentioned",,,Uncertain
"So, it would be hard to distinguish one from the other relative to any nuances there",,,
"I donâ€™t think there is an inventory issue certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers and adjust those for dollar cost of how pricing has changed over the course of the year",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"You do get a bit of a different perspective on inventory as reported by a variety of customers and channel partners in those areas, but the environment continues to be strong",,Positive,Confident
The supply demand circumstances continue to be fairly tight and we are working very closely with our customers to make sure that we stay in close sync with them as they think about their plans going forward,,,Uncertain
We do not rule out M&A in the future,acquisitions,,
"Right now, our focus is on the priorities that I mentioned that include cost competitiveness and strengthening the high-value mix in our revenue","sales,op_costs",,
"And of course, if and when, we were to engage in M&, our focus would, of course we to try to strengthen our future opportunity and make it an opportunity thatâ€™s absolutely provides a strong ROI, beyond that I would not speculate in this matter",,Positive,Confident
"I mean, we are definitely seeing strong demand trends from â€“ the entire spectrum of our customers a large what you would call Tier 1 or Tier 2 as you termed, although all customers are important to us and we do engage meaningfully with them and we work closely with them to understand their demand requirement and we apply our own judgment to their demand requirements as well in terms of assessing that overall industry demand trends",,Positive,Confident
"And based on those demand understanding of our â€“ on behalf of our customers, we project healthy industry supply environment in DRAM and NAND",,,
"So, we talked about being at bit output crossover for 1X DRAM by before the end of the calendar year of 2018. And then as we have previously shared for the 1X node, we see somewhere roughly 45% increase in bits per wafer versus 20 nanometer and about a 20 â€“ to slightly more than 20% cost reduction on a cost per bit",op_costs,,
"So we say that our SSD mix was about 20% of our NAND revenue and that consists of our sales of client, two client customers as well as to the hyperscale of cloud and enterprise customers",sales,,
And both are roughly about the same in both of those categories,,,
"Beyond that, we donâ€™t provide further breakdown",,,
"In general, the technology complexity increases where subsequent technology generations both in DRAM and NAND and also given the increased technology complexity, gigabytes or gigabits that you gain in NAND as well as DRAM on a per wafer basis tends to decline with advanced technology nodes",,,
"So, all of those factors play a role in terms of cost reduction capabilities as well going forward",op_costs,,
I can do that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I just want to add a comment to the previous question on cost,op_costs,,
My comment was related to cost on a per wafer gigabyte per wafer basis from one technology node to the next,op_costs,,
"Of course, cost also depends very much on how you deploy those technologies into volume production","op_costs,products_services",,
And this is one of our focus areas in terms of deploying advanced technologies faster into production,products_services,,
"Now, specific to your second question regarding the attach rates in enterprise and server markets, so SSD attach rate is around 50% there in terms of on a SSD per unit basis and opportunity there is greater",,,
Average capacities are definitely moving fairly fast,,,
"In fact, enterprise and data center is one of the fastest growth segments for flash in terms of year-over-year bits demand increases that are projected",sales,Positive,Confident
Average capacities in enterprise and data center for SSDs are over 3 terabyte,,,
Thatâ€™s average capacity and that trend continues to increase by some projections tripling almost to 9 terabyte by 2020 timeframe,,,
"So as I was saying earlier, I mean, these demand trends for increasing attach rate of SSDs in client and data center cloud computing applications as well as the increases in average capacities are secular trends",,,
"Yes, Mike",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, certainly the statement about no new wafer capacity in fiscal year â€˜18 applies equally to both DRAM and NAND",,,
"And relative to your second question, there is not anything material relative to the CapEx guide that we shared that relates to construction costs or whatnot","op_costs,organic_expansion",,
"As you pointed out, there is obviously incremental clean room space available or could be available at pretty low cost, but it would not be material in course of the overall guide that we provided",op_costs,,
"I think in the flagship models, to answer your specific question, the demand for DRAM as well as for NAND, average capacities continues to go up",,,Uncertain
"And of course, the mix of these high-end smartphones also as a part of the total smartphone market continues to go up",sales,,
"And specifically to DRAM, average capacities of DRAM in high-end smartphones going from somewhere over 3 gigabyte in 2017 projected to go up to over 5 gigabyte closer to 6 gigabyte by 2020 timeframe",,,
"And specifically to NAND, average capacities of NAND in high-end smartphones in 2017 is somewhere around 70 gigabyte, letâ€™s say, projected to double â€“ or more than doubled by 2020 timeframe as well",,,

"The way I think about it, we really â€“ Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago â€“ it's been a little longer than that now, to over-index on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud",,,Uncertain
We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition cost,"op_costs,acquisitions",,
We invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities and our sales force,sales,,
We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers,sales,,
That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number,products_services,Positive,Confident
"And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts",sales,Positive,Confident
"A lot of that account value frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue",sales,,
Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be,sales,Positive,Confident
And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have,"sales,op_costs,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making,organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
It's starting to pivot to consumed,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet,sales,,

And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land,,,
"And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors",,,
But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate,,,
And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core,"sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
"And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
The margins weren't as high either,"sales,earnings",,
And so I do think it will be a blend of those,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from",,,
"And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. Transitions take time",,,
"And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice",,,
"But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3. And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads","sales,earnings",,
"And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace",,,
Sure,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously,,,
"I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer",,,
I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter, and it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn",,,
Our real goal for LinkedIn is â€“ over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets,products_services,,
"But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members",,Positive,Confident
And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure,,,
"So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy",,,Uncertain

"And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction",,,Uncertain

"And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018.",,,

"You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example",,,
The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM,,,
Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile,,,

"And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value",products_services,,
"This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs",sales,,
And so what you'll continue to see is that would normalize,,,
"Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself",,,
"Great, let me take both of those",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking two that I probably don't relate as directly, and I should do that for you",,,Uncertain
"We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out",,,

And so I wouldn't say that I view those two things as waiting for one to do the other,,,
"We've in fact continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends, as well as repurchase shares",,,
And we've continued to do that this quarter as well,,,
"I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related",,,Uncertain
"The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new",,,Uncertain
"And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS",,,
"At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them",organic_expansion,,
"So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities",,,
"We learn, frankly, I think every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate",,,Uncertain
"That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint",,,
"More I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more and if we aren't, it won't",sales,,
And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number,,,
I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments,"sales,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"And are they earning the right return? Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the might market? Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities? What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on","sales,earnings",,
And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers,,,
"And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year",sales,,
"And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.",,,

"Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen",,,

"These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself",,,

"And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly",,,
"This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology",,,
"Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better",products_services,,
"That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement","sales,earnings",,
"Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really",,,
The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change,products_services,,

"I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we are getting","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"All of those things I think, itâ€™s not really about the pace, it is much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can and I feel really good about the team's execution",,,Uncertain
"And I think in many ways Keith what we have done is a really a natural extension of some of the investments weâ€™ve made over the past 18 months to add technical resources to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
You are seeing it even in our intelligent cloud results for the last quarter and this quarter,,,
Weâ€™re taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they will have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
Thanks Karl,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me make sure I cover of on most of those,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Let me start by saying, the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals",sales,Positive,Confident
"The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall",sales,Positive,Confident
"There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, thatâ€™s definitely not an impact on that number",,,
"And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it is really I think to your point; it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY 2018 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers",,,Uncertain
"Thereâ€™s a couple of things, but in general it is almost always mix shift",sales,,
"While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that it is also the balance, right","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
This is the first quarter where weâ€™ve actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual,sales,,
"So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well",,,
"But you also saw - and what really does matter, especially in Azure is usage of growth, really consumption growth having customers use deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think sort of meters up and running and that continues to build on itself, and so when you start to see that you can, and I do think and we will continue to see good growth in this number",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Let me start by saying, first I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR",,,Uncertain
"Next, I think across every service the momentum weâ€™ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"One of the things we often talk about is, we sell Microsoft 365. Thatâ€™s Windows 10 with securities and services",products_services,,
It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS,,,
We really did see strength across all of them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So I don't really think itâ€™s about a percentage, but itâ€™s about each of them continuing to make progress",,,Uncertain
Why don't you start and I will do the next one,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so to your point and itâ€™s a nice transition from Satya's point about, especially the midmarket offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365 is installed base growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"You are right, in terms of Office commercial 365 the primary driver is still installed base, both the transition as well as new",,,
"I think we are optimistic as we head into FY 2018 for the installed base growth possible in particular for some of these midmarket offerings that weâ€™re quite proud off The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen in the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"When we mentioned E5, I think thatâ€™s frankly encouraging for us because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion",,,Uncertain
"People start using E1 then they use E3 and then you start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that",,,
"However, in terms of ARPU impact very, very small in quarter",,,
So thatâ€™s something that over time you will continue to see improvement in terms of impact on ARPU.,,,
Thanks Kash,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Let me go through the bookings, again with that 30% the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter",,Positive,Confident
"It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S",,,
"and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings",sales,Positive,Confident
"I think we felt very good, those as well, I think weâ€™re pretty broad-based across industry",,,Uncertain
I would also say across geo,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way youâ€™d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good",sales,Neutral,NIL
Thatâ€™s in the KPI Windows commercial products and services,products_services,,
It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors,,,
"And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but itâ€™s also the investments weâ€™ve made",organic_expansion,Positive,Uncertain
"Weâ€™ve committed, we did sales overlays",sales,,
We added technical resources,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We put resources at customers ahead of the curve, we did that you saw that and the operating in the intelligent cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters, that execution is whatâ€™s landing",sales,Positive,Confident
"Okay, you are right, Mark itâ€™s not exactly if I said is the Q3 from three years ago exactly the expiry base it is not exactly, but it is directionally",,,
"And so thatâ€™s a good example to say, every three years tends to be the length of our agreements and so you to tend to see that repeated, and thatâ€™s what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base and that is the pattern",,,
In terms of LinkedIn having any impact? It did not,,,
So that is the cleanest way to think about that number,,,Uncertain
"And so that leads why I always tend to say, I don't focus as much on the mix per se",sales,,
"I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so thatâ€™s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem",,,
"And so I think, we remain confident that double-digit target that we have for that KPI and is it really, I don't think sort of a comparability challenge per se, but thatâ€™s why we try to keep it at that high level to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion thatâ€™s possible, we know we can grow within it",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"And I apologize, I didn't answer Marks last component, so let me just go back and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1, the answer is, it is up a little year-over-year, but in certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable",,,
"When we tend to have these, we tried to call them out like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So, Q1 I would say is just up a little",,,
So I wouldn't expect any material impact,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines,products_services,,
"And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but thatâ€™s why I tend to not focus at that layer itâ€™s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time youâ€™d expect a higher mix of premium versus core",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain

I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and expectations for Q4. Ron?,,,
Our success in all-flash arrays is broad and wide,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We have net new customers, we have new workloads within our existing customers, and upgrades within our install base",,,
"I would tell you that the net new customers and new workloads are materially bigger as a percentage of our all-flash business, reflected, for example, in the market share gains we're seeing in the SAN business, rather than our traditional install base",,,
"As percentage of our install base, all-flash FAS is a very small percentage",,,
It's less than 10% of the deployed install base,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we've got lots of headroom to go,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Let me take the first question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We are seeing momentum both because we have a compellingly differentiated product set,products_services,,
"As we have noted, the all-flash market is now going from early adopter to the mainstream market where customers are moving entire disk-based estates over to solid-state and therefore require the full range of features in their all-flash arrays from a business process, from a data management protection and availability perspective",,,
"Both all-flash FAS, as well as SolidFire give customers a compellingly differentiated platform; and the EF-Series is the fastest performing box in the industry",,,
"I think, in addition, we are clearly seeing disarray at our competitors",,,Uncertain
"Our leading competitors, neither have the flagship flash product, as well as going through substantial challenges from an integration perspective",products_services,,
"And customers are looking to NetApp to give them a path forward for their all-flash estates, as well as to the hybrid cloud",,,
"I think, first of all, in the competitive landscape, things have not changed substantially",,,Uncertain
"As we said, the major competitor that we go up for the majority of the deals are the large system manufacturers, most notably EMC and the other high-end SAN arrays that we are displacing with all-flash FAS",,,
"HP has always been the low-price leader, and they lack the feature set in terms of data management services",products_services,,
So they compete aggressively on price,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And the startups are increasingly challenged to differentiate themselves, and so you see evidence of desperation from various different smaller startup players",,,
I'll just leave it there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth",products_services,Positive,Confident
"In terms of the strategic numbers, it's only product revenue that comprises the strategic number","sales,products_services",,
"Our all-flash array number includes products and services, right? I think when you think about all-flash versus hybrid flash arrays, I mean, they're essentially solutions we offer customers",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Some customers, for their workloads, choose all-flash solutions and some customers choose hybrid solutions",,,
We have a unique advantage in the market that we are able to offer customers choice with the same set of data management capabilities,,,
"So if the price of NAND rises unexpectedly, we can always offer them a hybrid solution which no one else in the market can offer",,,
"We have NVMe support in the flash arrays that we introduced to market, so the flat FAS9000, the 8200, 2600 series all have NVMe integrated onboard for a low latency cash",,,
We also have in the A700s a NVMe over fabric ready architecture,,,
NVMe will become just like fiber channel,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It'll take time to get adopted and become deployable widely at customers as a true storage solution,,,
"We're working with the industry to make that available, and it will become part of every platform",,,
I don't think there is meaningful differentiation from NVMe,,,Uncertain
"I think, as I've said continuously, proven data management capabilities, integration in the application domain, and delivering business value will be the composition with customers",,,Uncertain
"NVMe will become a check box that all of us will have, us included",,,
"First of all, in terms of the cost savings that we have taken on, it's a transformation across all aspects of the business",op_costs,,
"I would say in the product portfolio, it is to leverage the capabilities that the supply chain has to not only meaningfully reduce the cost of introducing new hardware platforms, but actually accelerate the pace at which we are introducing new hardware platforms","op_costs,products_services,organic_expansion",,
The recent lineup of FAS hardware platforms were introduced at 3 times lower cost of introduction and three 3 faster,op_costs,,
So we're substantially better in terms of the way we build systems and hardware,,,
"The second is in terms of our shared services environments, we've consolidated the operations of many of our back end functions into a shared services platform",products_services,,
"There's continuing work to be done to complete that transition, but that offers promise of not only savings for this year, but in years to come by being much more efficient",,,
"Things like reporting, payroll administration, various elements of human resources and so on will be delivered from a centralized shared services facility rather than close to the employees, giving us both consistency and operating leverage","products_services,organic_expansion",,
"And in the go-to-market area, as you can see, the work that we have done, particularly in the services business, have materially improved the profitability of that line","earnings,products_services",,
"We've integrated, for example, self-service support, online chat as opposed to human support",products_services,,
"And you'll see us integrating advances in machine learning so that customers can both get better satisfaction, but at a lower cost",op_costs,,
So we remain committed to doing that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As we think about the savings that we generate, we'll continue to look at all of the options that are in front of us, right? Returning some of that through improved profitability to shareholders, as well as investing in the long-term growth of the business","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
One of the meaningful areas that we've invested in is SolidFire,,,
"And you can see, we're not only leveraging that investment in the all-flash array segment, but to deliver a compellingly differentiated hyper-converged offering to the market",organic_expansion,,
I think the install base of units is growing at a faster rate now,,,Uncertain
"I think in terms of the systems, life cycle continues to expand, right? So I think the continued extension of life cycle is what causes the install base to have legs and growth, right, in addition to the product revenue growth that we're seeing now, so","sales,products_services",Neutral,Uncertain
Okay,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Let me take the first one, and Ron will take the second",,,
"I think in terms of our approach to media prices, we've generally taken the position that we will pass on whatever cost structure being offered to us, benefit or disadvantage, from the media manufacturers to our customers",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
I think the caution is really reflecting the dynamic nature of SSD availability and pricing,,,Uncertain
"As we noted, we've put in place the capability to meet a short supply",,,
"We're wanting to guarantee a short supply to our end customers, and that has been a priority ahead of specific pricing agreements",,,
"From a channel program perspective, we've started to see the beginnings of an integrated channel program from EMC",,,
I'll just tell you that incentives are just a small part of the total value proposition that a channel partner looks for from their supplier,,,
"I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners","sales,earnings,products_services",Neutral,Uncertain
"So we're going to continue to attack with the full breadth of our channel, and we are making progress as our results note",,,
"They are solutions that are fixed configurations of our Clustered ONTAP and all-flash FAS products that make it easy for the channel to procure, and we did include that in a couple of the past quarters",products_services,,
So there's a slight adjustment for that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The second question was on amortization,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We have a broad book of business around the world,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I would just tell you our book of business is affected by GDP outlook, as well as the competitiveness of our portfolio and execution against those opportunities",,,
We didn't notice any specific change in pattern through the course of the quarter across the broad base of geographies that we serve,,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We expect the trend to continue the same,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think through the course of the quarter, we saw a strong year-end budget flush",,Positive,Uncertain
"We saw January return to fairly normal patterns of uncertainty across the geographies that we serve and saw linearity similar to normal sort of back end loaded quarters, right? I think in terms of the segments of the market that we serve, I think our pivot is targeting the faster growing parts of the market",,,Uncertain
"So there's a lot more interest as a share of wallet for the technologies that we're offering today, like solid-state, next-generation data centers, object storage, as well as what we're thinking about delivering to market in the hyper-converged space",,,Uncertain
"I think in terms of traditional environments, you continue to see people sweat assets trying to get longer lifecycles out of that",,,Uncertain
We're benefiting from the fact that we've got a differentiated portfolio,,,
We're benefiting from the fact that the portfolio is targeting the places where customers are spending,,,
"And, frankly, we're benefiting from the fact that Clustered ONTAP significantly and substantially transforms the cost structure for legacy frame array",op_costs,,
We can go in there at an order of magnitude greater efficiency and enable lots more software features than they've historically had,,,
We'll give you more details of the long-term outlook at our Analyst Conference,,,
I can just tell you that we are increasingly seeing wins where people are using NetApp Private Storage solutions connected to public cloud providers,,,
And what we've always said is we anticipate returning the company to moderated revenue growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"Our focus on transformation allows that moderated revenue growth to generate substantial returns to shareholders, and we're delivering on that commitment right now",sales,Positive,Confident
"I think if you look at our results today, we are gaining share in the markets that we serve",,,Uncertain
"In the all-flash array market, there's no question we're growing faster than competitors, big and small",,,
"I think if you look at the storage and device management market, we took over the number one position from EMC in that market",,,Uncertain
"We've made solid progress in Clustered ONTAP in terms of transitioning our install base, and are doing so with greater operating margin leverage","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"As we indicated on the call, we are working on a next-generation hyper-converged solution which we think will allow us to do to the hyper-converged market what we did to the all-flash array market: serve the needs of mainstream customers with a platform that's differentiated with performance, enterprise data management capabilities, and hybrid cloud integration",,,Uncertain
We think that's what the market wants,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And we're focused and going to be delivering that, and you'll see us make some exciting announcements early next fiscal year",,,
It isn't a net new market that we serve,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It will allow us to serve the system or virtualization administrator at customers rather than the storage administrators,,,
The hyper-converged market today is sort of a first-generation solution,,,
The solutions don't have enterprise data management features,,,
"They have challenges with performance consistency, which requires them to become a single workload configuration and are, therefore, addressing the low-end market, the departmental market",,,
There are few solutions that can really serve anything broader than that market,,,
"What we're trying to bring to customers, just like we did in the all-flash array market, is a solution that allows customers the benefits of ease of administration, but with the unique benefits of performance and scalability, enterprise data management and hybrid cloud integration, which really gives us a net new market to address",,,
"As I've said, as part of our transformation efforts we have continued to leverage the supply chain, the industry supply chain, to build technology for us",organic_expansion,,
"If you look at the recent A700s flash-optimized, NVMe fabric ready architecture, it was sourced by â€“ off the â€“ an ODM model, right? So we are expanding the range of usage of off the line platforms across the range of our business, both in SolidFire as well as in our traditional FAS business",,,
"Could you speak up a little bit, please? Kulbinder S",,,
Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC I'm sorry,,,
"A question on gross margins, again","sales,earnings",,
Did you say that the gross margins between the mature and the strategic segment are pretty similar?,"sales,earnings",,
We've had also been running promotions to get our customer base transitioned from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP,,,
"As we announced this quarter, those promotions â€“ we've transitioned 50% of the capacity in our install base to Clustered ONTAP, and so we're seriously evaluating whether we need to continue those promotions",,,
Kulbinder S,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC And so, would you say we're near the trough on gross margins, then?","sales,earnings",,
"I think in both of those cases, our perspective is the long-term winner, as we have demonstrated in the all-flash array market, is the one that can take an architecture and serve the mainstream customer segment",,,Uncertain
There have been lots of companies that have gone after the early-adopter segment with a subset of the features that enterprise customers really want and have failed in the long run,,,
"And so, first to market doesn't necessarily mean the big winner, right? I think what we are trying to do with the hyper-converged segment is the same track record that we've demonstrated with the all-flash array segment, which is customers want mature enterprise data management features",,,Uncertain
"They want performance consistency and scalability, so that they don't have to have operationally a siloed environment",,,
"And hybrid cloud is really the architecture of the data center going forward, and they want true hybrid cloud integration",,,
"And so, we think that by offering those capabilities to customers, we will redefine the hyper-converged market just like we did to the all-flash array market",,,Uncertain
The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
We're expanding our opportunity by addressing an increasing range of strategic customer use cases,,,
"We've completely refreshed our portfolio of hybrid and all-flash arrays, delivered an industry-leading storage efficiency guarantee to the market, expanding our cloud-based services, and soon we will introduce a next-generation Hyper converged solution",products_services,,
All of this underpins our growing confidence in the future,,,

"The success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which were 69% of net product revenue in Q2, up 23% year-over-year","sales,products_services",,
Customers are moving to all-flash arrays as they modernize existing data centers and build next-generation data centers to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications,op_costs,,
This shift creates enormous new opportunity for us as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors' equipment with our cloud-integrated all-flash solution,,,

Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets,,,
Our clustered storage solutions have substantial and structural technological advantages over competitors' SAN products,products_services,,
"This is enabling us to gain share in the SAN market, both in new customer acquisitions and in greater share of wallet within existing customers as we displace legacy competitive SAN installations",acquisitions,,
The all-flash FlexPod again helped to strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 20% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC's Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker for calendar Q2 2017. We continue to outpace and win against full stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution,sales,Positive,Confident

"The new EF570 all-flash array designed specifically for performance-intensive workloads such as big data analytics, technical computing and video surveillance, leads both the SPC-1 and SPC-2 benchmarks for price performance and is the first enterprise all-flash array to support NVMe over InfiniBand for ultra-low-latency applications",,,
The newest SolidFire Element OS helps customers align business goals to IT service levels with new user-defined quality of service policies to further simplify performance management in rapidly evolving private clouds,products_services,,
NetApp's SnapMirror integration supports data movement from Element OS systems to ONTAP systems across the Data Fabric,,,
"These SolidFire innovations are incorporated in NetApp HCI, the first enterprise-scale hyper-converged infrastructure solution which began shipping at the end of Q2. We enable customers to overcome the limitations of inflexible first-generation HCI products that strand resources, throttle the performance acquired by next-generation applications and are not able to consolidate workloads",products_services,,
Customers are excited that we are delivering on all of the promises of HCI and we are seeing strong demand for this offering,,Positive,Confident
"More and more customers, partners and service providers are choosing NetApp because of our hybrid cloud strategy",products_services,,

We're not going to break out the guide of product versus services,products_services,,
But the 7% number that you impute is aggregate revenue,sales,,
So we see continued acceleration of our business through the second half of this year,,,
"With regard to our portfolio of innovation, we are winning both on-premises deployments as well as net new customer logos because of our Data Fabric strategy",,,

"We have a portfolio of both all-flash and hybrid flash solutions, and one of the things we have noticed is that some customers are choosing hybrid flash since the price increases in solid-state",,,
And so our unique approach where we have a single software architecture that can span both gives us a differentiated competitive position as well,,,
And so we've been using that to be disciplined in the marketplace,,,
"First of all, thanks for your question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The percentage of our installed base that is on solid-state is just about 10% now,,,
And so we have a long base of footprint to go upgrade,,,
"And as you know, with our Clustered operating system, the process to upgrade our installed base to solid-state is pretty seamless",,,
You can move from disk to flash in a seamless mechanism,,,
And so we have a good opportunity ahead of us as flash continues to become more and more affordable relative to disk,,,
"With regard to hyper-converged, I think that that's an opportunity for net new customer acquisition, net new workload capture and primarily at the expense of direct-attached storage or alternate storage solution from our competitors, and so we do see hyper-converged being additive to our installed base","op_costs,acquisitions",Neutral,Uncertain
"We are seeing that today in the use cases for hyper-converged as opposed to converged system like FlexPod, they are different",,,

Let me start with a quick recap of our results and John will provide more details in his remarks,,,
"As I mentioned, we delivered a solid fourth quarter",,,
"We reported $0.42 of non-GAAP EPS at the top end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.42. We delivered $2.981 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis",sales,,
"This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow",sales,Positive,Confident
"For the full year we delivered $1.50 of non-GAAP EPS, which came in at the top of our initial full-year guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Our revenues grew 21% on a pro forma FX neutral basis above our initial 2016 guidance of 19%",sales,Positive,Confident
"And despite the increased size of our revenue base, we grew faster in 2016 than in 2015. We ended the year at $10.84 billion of revenue and we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, well above the initial guidance we provided",sales,Positive,Confident
"Perhaps more importantly, the underlining drivers of our revenue growth saw continued strong performance throughout 2016. We ended the year with $197 million active customer accounts, adding 5.4 million new accounts in Q4, our highest organic total in two years","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Customer engagement in the fourth quarter increased to 31 transactions for active accounts up from 27 a year ago, and 30 last quarter",,,
Our growth in Q4 came from across our global platform and we benefited from a notable shift in consumer behavior,sales,Positive,Confident
Holiday shoppers increasingly bought gifts online and with their mobile devices through convenient omni-channel shopping experiences,,,
"For PayPal, this helps drive a 25% increase in payment volume, resulting in $99.3 billion of payment volume in the quarter",,,
"According to Internet retailer, Black Friday 2016 was the largest mobile shopping day in history",,,
Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday PayPal processed more than 2 billion in mobile payments,,,
And mobile accounted for a third of our overall payment volume during the quarter,,,
Mobile is becoming an increasingly important competitive differentiator for PayPal,,,
More than half of our active account base transacted on the PayPal platform using their mobile device over the last 12 months,,,
The scale and reach of our platform clearly separates PayPal as one of the world's leading FinTech companies,,,
"In 2016, we processed 6 billion payments, an increase of 24%",,,
"This represented a total payment volume of 354 billion flowing through the PayPal platform of which more than 100 billion was mobile payment volume, an increase of 55%",,,
"We saw strong growth in peer-to-peer payments, with P2P payment volume growing 57%, more than $64 billion for the year",sales,Positive,Confident

"As you may recall, Venmo processed 1 billion in monthly TPV for the first time just last January",,,
"For the full year, Venmo processed $17.6 billion, up 135%",,,
Itâ€™s been several years since we expanded our mission to be more than a button on the website,,,
"We have evolved to become the platform and payments partner of choice for merchants around the world, as they move towards a multichannel retail experience driven by the mobile phone",,,
"For example, with Braintree's commerce infrastructure tools, we are creating simpler ways for merchant install for contextual commerce experiences that transform the way consumers shop and pay",,,
"For entries forward API, which merchants securely share, payment data with other sites and apps, allowing customers to purchase from multiple merchants in a single convenient and secure experience",,,

One Touch has redefined online checkout,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Simply put it produces by its and away the best conversion rate in the payments industry by making it faster and simpler for customers to pay with the single tax,,,
Its adoption has well exceeded our projections,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We ended the year with over 5 million merchants offering One Touch to more than 40 million consumers,,,
PayPal has the unique distinction in the corresponding benefit of having a deep and trusted relationship with almost 200 million merchants and consumer accounts through our two sided network,,,
This means we can deliver new payment experiences like One Touch for the speed and impact that there is truly differentiated,,,
eBay and PayPal have always enjoyed a close partnership,,,
eBay CEO Devin Wenig and I are committed to further strengthening what is already a strong relationship,,Positive,Confident
We are working closely to creating better payment experiences for their buyers and sellers,,,
"For example, our teams collaborated this past year on new customized checkout experiences that helps to reduce card abandonment, increase loyalty, and help buyers seamlessly transact on eBay's platform",,,
"As we look to 2017, we see even greater opportunities to work together",,,
"In the quarter, we were also proud to welcome several great brands to our platform",,Positive,Confident
"DE, the second-largest retailer in Europe, Crate and Barrel, which now offers PayPal as a payment option on its web and mobile sites, and on the CB2 and landed not cite for their global customers",,,
"Squarespace, an all in one website publishing e-commerce platform",,,
Now itâ€™s more than 1 million paid subscribers,,,
Seamlessly integrate PayPal into their online stores,,,
"To give you an idea of the demand for PayPal within the first 24 hours of launching, we saw hundreds of Squarespace merchants integrate into PayPal and that demand continues",,,
"Finally, consumers can now create a campaign on go funding on behalf of their favorite charity",,,
By doing so they take advantage of the PayPal giving funds facility to receive and process donations and avoid the complexity of having to handle the funds themselves,,,
"Last year, highlighted our commitment to putting our customerâ€™s front and centre",,,
That led to our decision to offer greater customer choice in our payments experiences,,,
This in turn has a recast to competitive landscape for PayPal and enables landmark partnerships and alliances that continue to expand and extend our opportunity for growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"These partnerships are focused on giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to use PayPal anywhere they want, in stores, in apps, online and a new context for the consistent, convenient, and secure experience, following the announcements of our strategic partnership with Visa on our Q2 earnings call and MasterCard in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we announced our first partnership agreement with financial institutions",earnings,Neutral,NIL
"These include agreements with Citi, the largest global credit card issuer and Fidelity National Information Services known as FIS, which represents thousands of financial institutions",products_services,,
This is just the beginning,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
As our conversation with almost all leading financial service players are warm and welcoming,products_services,,
"Earlier this month, we announced the strategic agreement with Discover Financial Services",products_services,,
This partnership allows the PayPal wallet to be closely linked and Discover cardholders acquires and merchants,,,
"It will allow PayPal credit customers who link their discover cards to purchase online, in-app and in-store at contact listed enable merchants in the US",,,
"And in a first for us, PayPal customers will be able to use their discover cash back bonus to pay for purchases at the millions of online and mobile merchants that accept PayPal",,,
"We expect that the reward points will become an easy convenient and alternative source for customers of PayPal and our financial institution partners, the pay for online and mobile shopping due to PayPal platform",,,
"As mobile and digital payments continue to provide new opportunities for bringing cost consumers and companies close together, we're partnering with other market leaders across a variety of industries",op_costs,,
"In the fourth quarter, we entered into an extended partnership with cellular carriers, software providers and leading consumer brands",,,
One prominent example of this is the global partnership agreement we announced with Intuit,,,
"Building on successful regional agreements, we are not deploying our express checkout and more than 1.5 million quick book small businesses and self-employed customers worldwide",,,
The PayPal and Intuit partnerships due to business owners simpler and faster ways to accept invoice payments and significantly accelerate the fees with which they can collect funds,,,
"Based on our role out in Australia, we found that merchants who offered PayPal payments in their quick book invoices will pay two times faster than it to get paid without PayPal",,,
This meaningful improvement in cash flow is crucial for the SMB market,,,
We are proud to bring this benefit to Intuits customers,,,
"Our partnerships with Facebook, Google, American Mobile, Vodafone, AliExpress, and other financial institutions and major retailers continue to grow as our platform and capabilities expand",,,
2016 was a transformative year for PayPal,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Our separation from eBay afforded us an opportunity to sign a unique, meaningful, and expansive mission for our company",,,
I believe our expanded focus and value proposition allowed us to widen the distance from our competitors,,,
"We upgraded our platform invested significantly in our global compliance capabilities, improved our developer tool sets, and drove our scale and engagement through a unique and enhanced value proposition",,,
We are inspired and focused on the opportunities in front of us and we look forward to providing ever more value to our customers and our shareholders,,,
Before I conclude my remarks Iâ€™d like to just take this opportunity to publicly welcome the newest member of PayPalâ€™s Board Belinda Johnson,,,
Belinda has filled an impressive track record at Airbnb,,,
She has been a key architect in their growth and has held to chart new business approaches and innovative customer experiences,sales,Positive,Confident
Sheâ€™s already proving to be a great addition to our board and we look forward to her valuable contributions,,Positive,Confident
"And with that, let me hand it over to John",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
You're talking about the increase in our revenue guidance?,sales,,
"So, we are taking off our revenue guidance on an FX neutral basis and the reason we are doing that is there is a tremendous amount of secular tailwinds that we are seeing right now",sales,Positive,Confident
"As I mentioned in my remarks, seeing money digitizing is a big move to mobile, it is a big move to really online being sort of online payments and then pick up in stores or commerce is really just becoming commerce",,,
"I mean a great example of that is this was the best retail holiday season in five years, but you saw - in-store sales actually drop and online move up to almost 17%, 18% or so",,Positive,Confident
"And so as we look at these secular tailwinds behind us, we look at the performance of things like One Touch and its clear advantage that we have now in mobile and the scale we have the increased engagement we are seeing",products_services,Positive,Confident
New market opportunities frankly internationally that we are beginning to see and have a platform now that we can extend to many more markets of Venmo,,,
We see the beginning of monetization as we come into this year,,,
"And we are seeing the back of the year, the beginnings of some in-store volumes based on tokenization and our partnerships with both the network and financial institutions and then we've got a tremendous number of new partnerships, whether it be with Facebook, or Intuit or FIâ€™s really around the world right now that is growing exponentially since we've announced our network agreement",,,
So there are a host of reasons right now that our confidence has improved in terms of our top line growth rate and by the way thatâ€™s also lacking 200 million of Xoom,sales,Positive,Confident
"So think about that, as well as you think about kind of the revenue guidance we gave",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So, we think they are good prospects ahead of us",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We are very focused on those opportunities and we are comfortable with that guidance,,,
Bryan itâ€™s Dan,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Iâ€™ll take the first part of that and then Iâ€™ll wisely let John take the next part of it,,,
"So, let me just back up a little bit, as you know and everyone on the call knows credit is and will continue to be an important flywheel for us",,,
Credit gives flexible payment option to both our margins and to consumers,"sales,earnings",,
"It reduces card abandonment, it increases basket size for our merchants and consumers",,,
When somebody uses credit they do two times the spend on our PayPal network than somebody who doesn't,,,
"When we do PayPal working capital on average those that we lend to, they see their sales go up 20% plus, and so itâ€™s a tremendous flywheel for us",,,
It is a small part of a business and itâ€™s likely to remain so as well,,,
"We don't need to chase growth here, we can be very responsible and who we lend to and how much we lend to them",sales,Positive,Confident
And we have great amounts of data and really I think world class modeling around this,,Positive,Uncertain
"That said that is no reason really to use our balance sheet or the receivables and there are, as we've mentioned before, a lot of benefits of asset right",,,
"Obviously, we tie up a lot of our free cash flow in the receivables with free cash flow, for other capital allocation that we might do, we have reduced exposure, we still have a differentiated proposition that we would use our data and our modeling with our partner to bring back a differentiated proposition into our phase and there are very attractive economics to share",,,
"And as we've seen right now, from people who are very interested in partnering with us, our portfolio is very effective",,,
"The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business",op_risks,Positive,Confident
That is a working hypothesis as we are going through this,,,
"We are in the early process of looking through this right now because it is a very competitive process out there as people look to potentially partner with us, you know we look to make a decision as we digest and sort through all the different proposals that weâ€™re seeing, that said very much likely to be a - if we go and how we do this exactly with the back half of 2017 event, but clearly there is a lot of demand, there is a lot of benefits for us moving towards asset light and we think as I mentioned you reduce risk and maintain strong economics for the business",op_risks,Positive,Uncertain
Let me try and jump the two questions in there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So let me start with the mobile and then I will go into the impact of some regulatory and change of administrations,,,
"Mobile, mobile is driving growth in the industry right now",sales,Positive,Confident
I mean more half the sales that are going online are being driven by mobile,,,
"Mobile is blurring lines of distinction between in-store environment and online environments, where like commerce is just becoming commerce",,,

"If we think about mobile, the real problem that merchants have with mobile is that when a browser begins the shopping experience on mobile between 65% and 74% of the time there is card abandonment because itâ€™s such a small screen, itâ€™s difficult to put of the payment information in there et cetera",,,Uncertain

I will start of a little bit and then you can jump in,,,
"So, like I say in terms of Venmo monetization pricing very little actually built into our guidance for 2017. We fully intend to rollout out Venmo, previous Venmo in a much broader basis in 2017. And we will see some impact in that, but really the big impact on that happens in 2018 and 2019. And so just see that and thatâ€™s, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond itâ€™s because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but letâ€™s model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere and so not much is built into that","sales,earnings",Positive,Uncertain

"We have fundamentally retooled our technology and infrastructure, leading to significant improvements and availability and develop our productivity",products_services,,
We have meaningfully improved our core experiences and expanded our suite of products,products_services,,
Our overall scale is accelerating due to the network effects of our two sided platform,,,
It is clearly a macro secular shift toward digital payments and our customer choice results continue to exceed our expectations,,,
"We have completed a rollout of choice across our on-boarding, servicing and checkout experiences in the United States and over 13 million customers have opted into choice",,,
We have the data from millions of customers over multiple quarters,,,
We are beginning to see clear trends resulting from our choice initiative,,,

"The results of choice on the numerous other product improvements, we delivered significant OpEx savings over the course of our three-year finding horizon",products_services,,

Choice will also help to expand PayPal's presence in our customers' lives,,,

"In the second quarter, we continue to make excellent progress with our partnerships",,,
"We continue to expand our relationship with Visa, expanding our partnership in the Europe",,,
"As most of you will recall, last quarter, we announced an agreement with Visa that covered the Asia-Pacific region",,,
"Consequently, we now work around the globe with Visa",,,
"And as part of our network agreement announced last year with Visa and Mastercard, we recently announced the new service as it designed to allow PayPal and Venmo users in the U.S",products_services,,
"to instantly transfer money to their bank account via eligible debit card, linked to their PayPal account",,,
Findings faster and more convenient ways for our customers to fund into and out of their PayPal accounts is a key part of our overall value proposition,,,
"Throughout the quarter, we saw a relationship with issuers grow increasingly collaborative and productive",products_services,,
"For example, we are pleased to see leading issuers including Wells Fargo and HSBC actively marketing PayPal to their customer base, encouraging their clients to link their cards into PayPal accounts",,,
We also announced new strategic relationships with JPMorgan Chase and as of today Bank of America to utilize their token services and enable their customers to easily integrate their cards into PayPal and seamlessly create a new PayPal account from their properties,products_services,,
"Furthermore, as part of our expanded relationship with Citi and Chase, we will make Citi ThankYou Rewards Points and Chase Ultimate Reward Points available in our PayPal wallet to be used as a funding source for consumers shopping at our 17 million merchants",,,
"As I've said on last quarter's call, it's hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across multiple sectors to many once view as potential competitors",,,
We are confident these partnerships will drive enhanced value to our mutual customers,,,
"The accelerating and extensive scale of our two sided global platform, which will allow consumers and merchants to transact instantly in new context, across operating system, technologies and platforms, create a strong foundation and is very attractive to multiple partners",,Positive,Confident
"Our open technology platform has enabled expanded partnerships with Google, Apple, Facebook and Samsung over the past few months",,,
These agreements benefit both PayPal and our partners by creating innovative consumer-focused experiences that connect their combined billions of consumers to new buying experiences enabled by PayPal's powerful platform,,,
"In April, Google announced an expansion of our partnership to make it easy for consumers to use PayPal as a payment method in Android Pay wherever it is accepted, in-store, in app and online",organic_expansion,,

We continue to make good progress in rolling out Venmo as a payment option for PayPal merchants,,,
"As we shared last quarter, we're not introducing the ability for U.S",,,
PayPal merchants to accept Venmo as a mobile payment option,,,
Venmo users are now able to use Venmo at an expanded number of PayPal merchants such as lululemon and Forever 21 and I'm quite encouraged by the early results,,,
We expect that the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely deployed across millions of our PayPal merchants by the end of this year and I look forward to sharing more details in the coming quarters,,,
"The ability to deliver new consumers and enhanced sales growth to merchants of all sizes is a key benefit of PayPal, especially as the world becomes more global and increasingly digital",sales,Positive,Confident
"As of today, this includes bringing the power and reach of the PayPal platform to the expansive and rapidly growing Chinese consumer market",,,
"We're very pleased to announce that PayPal has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Baidu, the leading Chinese language internet search provider with approximately 700 million users",,,
This partnership allows Chinese consumers to pay with their Baidu Wallet and PayPal at our merchants outside of China,,,
"Beginning later this year, this partnership will provide Chinese consumers more ways to discover and buy from PayPal merchants in the U.S",,,
and will eventually expand the PayPal's entire global merchant base outside of China,,,
We expect this partnership to drive significant demand and additional cross-border trade over the PayPal platform,,,
"In addition in helping our merchant customers maximize their opportunities in the age of digital commerce, another key part of our strategy is helping underserved consumers, join and thrive in the digital economy",,,

That vision has grown increasingly important to our merchants in today's rapidly evolving retail landscape,,,
Our execution in support of that vision is yielding strong results and expanding our leadership position,,Positive,Confident
Our efforts to place our customers' frontend centered everything we do is driving the scale and engagement on our platform,,,
It has opened the door to strategic and reductive partnerships that have extended the PayPal experience across multiple contexts in existing and new geographies,,,

Nice to hear you and thanks for the question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So I am quite pleased with our progress on engagement,,,
It is up 10% despite really what is an accelerating day right now which is kind of the high-class to have,,,
We are seeing tremendous adoptions across merchants and consumers into the PayPal franchise,,,
"As I mentioned, we think weâ€™ll exceed 25 million net new actives for the year",,,Uncertain
"In past couple of years, weâ€™ve taken our active user engagement up almost seven transactions per user across the whole days",,,
"And if you look under the covers what weâ€™ve done here quite a bit, the news is even better because the majority of our user engagement right now is coming from the core PayPal Wallet and in many prices before it was coming from growth of Braintree and core PayPal",sales,Positive,Confident
But now it is being driven the majority from our PayPal core wallet and that is a great story for us,,Positive,Confident
"And if you look at our product growth and our core PayPal franchise over the last several quarters, weâ€™ve taken multi-year trend that have been drifting slightly down in terms of their real growth year-over-year and we have bent these curves across pretty much every single one of our core products and they're now up and accelerating",products_services,Positive,Confident
"So, that is a piece of really good news that you probably wouldnâ€™t see from a number in and up itself",,,
"And it kind of feels like, weâ€™re just at the beginning of this",,,
"We've got One Touch that is driving engagement, thatâ€™s driving increased engagement and itâ€™s accelerating across the base",,,
"Choice still new, but choice engagement and summing up into choice that engagement is up quite substantially, and I am really pleased with what we are seeing from choice",,,
"As I mentioned, we're about 13 million plus customers that are in choice now, that will grow and that will impact engagement",,,
Weâ€™re obviously just beginning of the journey the movements in your context,,,
"Now, we now at basically major agreements, we're pretty much every major issuer, weâ€™ve got agreement from the financial networks to utilize their tokens and those start to move us, move more an in-store environment as we go into next year, that'll also drive engagement",,,
"Right now, there's no engagement with Venmo, it's P2P, but we don't count that in our engagement",,,
So also you'll see that drive up,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
TIO just came on,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Our new partnerships with Facebook and Google are going to start to kick in, that's really not in our guidance right now, as they -- those things are going to start to accelerate and drive our future growth as we look into '18, '19, '20. So, we still have a goal that would consumer use PyaPal two times a week",sales,Positive,Confident
"That is our goal, not to drive once a week, but to drive two times a week",,,
And I feel with all the initiatives we've right now and the trending that we're seeing that over -- our medium to long term thatâ€™s within our reach too,,,Uncertain
So feeling pretty good about where we're on the engagement side,,,
"You've violated first quarter rule, one question, but otherwise okay",,,
Correlate with it and I admire that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, listen one of the things I mentioned in my opening remarks is we're beginning to see a tremendously collaborative relationship with issuers right now",,,
We're seeing I mentioned two that are marketing to their pace to actively encourage them to link their cards into our PayPal account,,,
"And that's happening because we're going to drive growth for them, as John mentioned in his remarks, our MS TPV -- our TPV growth outside of eBay is growing at 30% and we're the perfect digital distribution channel for financial institutions especially now that we've implemented choice",sales,Positive,Confident
And consumer will opt on how they want to pay and where they want to pay on that,,,
"And so I think this acceleration of our net new actives is coming at a lower cost to it, so it's really found sort of one-two punch thatâ€™s positive for us now, but especially as we look forward",op_costs,Neutral,Uncertain
"Just to add to that, we saw first [indiscernible] well and we spent a lot of time as we started the transition of the Company from being really single product type of company to being a platform company that offers a suite of services to both merchants and the consumers",products_services,,
"And where we found and with a ton of detailed research and analytics on this is when we add an incremental service to a consumer or even to our merchants, we see the lifetime value basically double",products_services,,
"And so a consumer adds to P2P, we see them they engaged more, their use of PayPal goes up, their churn goes way down, and it is a gigantic benefit for our flywheel and for our economics",,,
"And so, the more products and services and experiences and more engagement we could have with the consumer and a merchant, the better the LTV is for us",products_services,,
"And that comes through us, as Bill said, historically as we have seen with P2P and others",,,
"We also start in-store with Vodafone as we go down, we have seen these",,,
People have used Vodafone and PayPal in-store,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
They use PayPal more in app and online because the distinctions between those things are blurring especially with mobile,,,
"And so, our ability to engage with consumers and drive that engagement is a good thing both for consumers, for merchants and for the economics of PayPal",,,
I'll start then maybe Bill can supplement,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, I would say and as I mentioned in my remarks, there's no one single thing driving the growth of those net new active",sales,Positive,Confident
"And as I mentioned, you know, I said I think we'll do an excess of 25 million net new active that would imply so that we're going to do another on average 6 million or so in the third and fourth quarter",,,Uncertain
So we see a continued strength in net new active,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"That's coming as a result and Bill won't say this, but I will from the great work that Bill and his product and engineering teams have done, great work that have done",products_services,Positive,Confident
The risk teams have done around improving our core experiences,op_risks,,

That matters a lot,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We got a new mobile app there,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We got One Touch,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We got choice coming in,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Choice is driving both reduction in churn which helps to net new actives obviously, but itâ€™s also driving additional new adds because the on-boarding process is so much more streamlined, and then you also have partners that are now actively marketing PayPal because together we're sort of allies in advancing digital payments and tapping into that growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"So I think there is a number of things and we also obviously with 210 million people now on the platform, weâ€™ve got maybe at a tipping point of these network effects right now where there's so many merchants on the platforms, so many consumers on the platform, that it's a must have for people especially if they move into mobile check out experiences",,,Uncertain
"I think what Bill and the risk teams have done and things like One Touch have really been an unparalleled kind of a mobile checkout experience, almost two times the conversion of the industry average",op_risks,Neutral,Uncertain
"And so, I'll look at a number of things that we've done over the course of the last several years, and they're beginning to take hold in the market, and really driving our results and Bill would you answer that",,,
"I'll just add one last thing and then we'll be done with your question, Ashwin",,,
"We didn't underestimate what can happen with Baidu, I mean we're now tapping into that Chinese consumer marketplace, and that is going to open up a whole new market for consumers to come on to the PayPal platform, interact with our PayPal merchants outside of China and drive what we think could be substantial cross-border traffic",,,Uncertain
"And I talked about this, it's not just Baidu, it's Baidu and PayPal",,,
So almost a little like we've done with Android Pay that it's a cobranded experience and sign up to our PayPal account from there,,,
"So, there're a lot of things that we're working on, a lot of things we still want to implement but feel good about the current trend right now",,,Uncertain
"Yes, so, we've done I think 24 major partnerships in the last 18 months and you've seen it last quarter starting to accelerate actually",,,Uncertain
And it's accelerated that people are beginning to understand the assets that we bring to our partners,,,
"We obviously bring our scale to partners and when you talk to different platforms whether it'd be Baidu or Google or Samsung, the ability to tap into 17 million merchants we have that long tail of merchants, that's a very difficult asset for others to replicate and it's accelerating in its growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"If you look at other partnerships, we can add potential for pretty significant additional growth for them, whether that's driven by mobile and we can do a One Touch or TPV that's accelerating",sales,Positive,Confident
"And as you know, we also control value prop end-to-end, there're very few players who do that, there're some players that can take a piece of it, but very few players own it including risk, custom service, brand reputation","products_services,op_risks",,
"And we own all of that parts of that proposition and we've also changed our model, quite a bit, we're an open platform and a suite of service both branded and unbranded that's operating system and device and technology agnostic",products_services,,
"And so, we're -- and very importantly, we're a neutral third party platform",,,
So we don't compete with any of our merchants or partners who are allies in advancing digital payments,,,
"So, I think our positioning is really good within the entire ecosystem to continue to partner",,,Uncertain
"There're a number of other partnerships that are on the horizon and I think the more we partner the more people see that the benefit of doing that could be quite substantial, so I think we announced enough partnerships right now, so we'll save some for the next -- for the next announcement",,,Uncertain
But I think we're really well positioned on that front,,,Uncertain
On the M&A front because you got two questions in there in a very subtle way,acquisitions,Neutral,NIL
"But on the M&A front, look we've a very strong balance sheet",acquisitions,Positive,Confident
"John mentioned, we've $6.4 billion of cash equivalents on our balance sheet",,,
We're generating -- now with our guidance is over $2.9 billion of free cash flow for the year,,,
So thatâ€™s the competitive advantage for us,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"There is no question about it and we are very active and looking at range of opportunities around the world, both big and small",,,
But look those opportunities needs the time to our vision in our mission,,,
They got to accelerate our progress either against the key vertical or geographic expansion,organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
"We do tuck-in acquisitions from a tech or functional capability like a TIO type of things, but we look at this in the through the lens of do we build, do we partner or do we buy",acquisitions,,
"And the amount of work that John and Bill done on there, respective platforms with risk capabilities or full infrastructure -- I mentioned the increased developer productivity, we can put out a ton of releases, now we put out some like 30,000 releases in the quarter","products_services,op_risks",,
I mean it's amazing in velocity of new functionality and innovation that Bill and his team are putting out into the market place,,,
"And so, well, we used to have to buy at onetime because it would take us month to make a change on our website because we have such a monolithic infrastructure",,,
"Now, there is a rapid velocity, a very innovative services coming in",products_services,,
Second thing is we can partner now in ways that we never partnered before,,,
We have new velocity about cooperating with people,,,
It's created in environment that gotten very competitive one to one thatâ€™s much more cooperative,,,
We have a ton of complimentary resources that we can use with partners,,,
"And now many times where we used to think that we will have to buy something, we can that partner on a commercial relationship to go and do that",,,Uncertain
"And then obviously, if we can't do any of that we look at buy and we do that in a very disciplined manner",,,
"We have got certain amount of skill and capabilities and so you can expect us to continue to be acquisitive, but in a disciplined fashion and within the context that what I just mentioned",,,
"So, Iâ€™ll start off and then Iâ€™ll turn it over to Bill",,,
But I think there is a real difference now with the partnerships that you mentioned that are major tech platform companies,,,Uncertain
I think none of that really wanted to go into payments as an end to itself,,,Uncertain
It was a means to an end that they have,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so, it might be more engagement on their platform and that engagement lead to key metrics that they want to try to keep the advertising, it could be other thing",,,
"And when we made the shift to being an open payments platform as opposed to just seeing a button as I check-out experience, and really open our platform up to pretty sophisticated technological upgrades through open APIs with the partnership we had with tokenization and that kind of thing",,,
"We were then able to become really in many ways an underlying payment OS or those tech platforms that enable them to create the experiences, that they wanted to drive for their end user",,,
And so that partnership is fundamentally different right now and it has evolved greatly over the last several years,,,
"I'll ask Bill to add a color to that, but it's a very different conversation that we have now then we used to have",,,
I'll start off with that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Obviously, we've worked closely with JP Morgan Chase over the last couple of years actually, as we've talked about the potential for how we might work together",,,
And I'm really pleased with where we came out in this partnership,,,
"We both see a lot of value in it, if two very strong companies lending what are really impressive assets to create consumer experiences, including as you mentioned processing through Chase Net which obviously does give the potential",,Positive,Confident
"We are not talking about any deal terms one way or another, but potential for lower cost from that",op_costs,,
So I'm really pleased with the comprehensive nature of the partnership that we have with Chase because time to work through all the details of it,,,
But I think both of us are really good about and really good about what we can drive coming out of that,,,Uncertain
"I think you just think about things like reward points, Discover, Chase, Citi have all decided that utilizing the reward points within the PayPal platform to utilize those for purchases that are 17 million merchants",,,Uncertain
"Thatâ€™s a real significant differentiation for those particular financial institutions and their customers who are using their instruments, but also for PayPal because you now can utilize those reward points in a split transaction",,,
"You have X number of reward points, but maybe couldnâ€™t do that full transaction",,Neutral,Uncertain
"You can now split that, you can use this reward points to purchase 40% of which we are going to do and then the other 60% can be done to whatever funding instrument you select as a consumer",,,
Thatâ€™s a little over a cost funding mechanism as well for us so,op_costs,,
"There are all sorts of things within these relationships that we have, they try to enhance value for our mutual customers that, if you parse through them, it's really quite significant and differentiated from where we were certainly a year or so ago",,,
"Now the in-store stuff, we obviously now have the ability to use industry tokens from these Mastercard and others",,,
"And now, we are working with each of the FIs to use their tokens for their particular instruments",,,
"And so, you will start to see thatâ€™s just a naturally begins our rollout",,,
There really is much of a trial and error per se on this,,,
"We will have the ability for our PayPal customer, if they are opted into one of the bank services thatâ€™s provided token, we will use network tokens with that",products_services,,
"And you will simply be able to use that instrument seamlessly across where actually it is accepted now on android phone for instance across in-app experience, online experience, or an in-store experience without us having to do bespoke customization of software at the point of sale terminal",,,

"salesforce is the fastest-growing top five enterprise software company in the world, and this year, we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue",sales,,
"And that will reach the milestone that we've been talking about, about being faster than any other enterprise software company in history to that $10 billion mark",,,
"In FY 2017, we drove tremendous execution, growth of scale and delivered unprecedented customer success",sales,Positive,Confident
"And we did this while integrating Demandware, our largest acquisition ever, launching innovative new products, including Einstein, and adding more than 5,000 employees","products_services,acquisitions",,
"When I joined salesforce nearly four years ago, Marc and I put together a plan to become more strategic to our customers and to become more of an enterprise skilled company, and that plan really had three parts to it",,,
Number one was the focus on industry,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
This is all about speaking the language of the customer and bringing industry expertise and launching industry products in the marketplace,products_services,,
The second was expanding our international reach to serve our global customers,,,
"Very, very important",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And the last was building the world's strongest ecosystem in the cloud, and that was with our SI partners and our ever-expanding ISV community",,Positive,Confident
"Well today, we have strategic relationships with the largest and most successful companies in the world",,,
"We're inspiring companies of all sizes, all industries and all geographies",,,
We have clearly become the trusted advisor to our customers for their digital transformations,,,
"All of this is translating to our results, including a record number of big transactions",,,
"In fact, we hit a huge milestone this fiscal year which we're incredibly proud of, and that was achieving 100 $10 million-plus relationships on an annual basis and the number of $20 million-plus relationships has nearly doubled in just one year",,,
Pretty incredible progress,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Now, let's talk about some of the highlights in the quarter, starting with our industry strategy, again one of our growth pillars",sales,Positive,Confident
We had strong growth in Q4 in all of our target industries,sales,Positive,Confident
"In fact, the largest deal in the quarter was a massive expansion with one of the world's leading CPG brands based in Europe using Marketing Cloud, sales Cloud and Service Cloud to deliver personalized consumer experiences","products_services,organic_expansion",,
"We expanded our relationships in Q4 with three of the five largest CPG companies in the world, all of them running on salesforce",,,
"And, as you recall from last quarter, our momentum is continuing in financial services",products_services,,
"In Q4, we expanded relationships with U.S",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Bank, SunTrust, TD Bank and many, many more",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're also building on a very strategic relationship with Farmers Insurance,,,
"Now that's from our early days in helping them modernize their customers' self-service to bringing more synergy across their customer, agent, employee and partner channels",products_services,,
Healthcare continues to be strong for us,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In Q4, we expanded relationships with Anthem, athenahealth and one of the largest healthcare companies in the United States, Humana",,,
And just a quick update on Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud,products_services,,
It's been less than a year since they've been GA and we've already seen great traction,,Positive,Confident
"In fact, more than 70% of customers who have purchased one of these industry solutions are net new logos to salesforce in this fiscal year",,,
So all of these are proof positive around the power of speaking the language of the customer,,,
"Now on to international, our second growth strategy",sales,Positive,Confident
Each of our regions grew more than 25% in constant currency for the full year,,,
"In fact, EMEA and Asia Pac both grew 29% year-over-year in constant currency",,,
"So today, nearly 30% of our revenue is outside of the Americas and this represents a huge, huge growth opportunity for us",sales,Positive,Confident
And we'll continue to accelerate our international expansion to meet our customers' demand and I fully expect our revenue mix to be more balanced over time,sales,,
"And this is, again, something that we're very, very focused on and very excited about",,,
"Now to that end, we expanded relationships in Q4 with some amazing brands like Shell, Michelin, Emirates and Maersk in Europe",,,
"We drove strong financial services momentum as well, again, in the industry with 5 of the top 15 banks in Europe this quarter including Banco Santander and BCC, again, all running their business on salesforce",products_services,Positive,Confident
"We had other huge international wins in the quarter with BRF, Latin America's largest food company, also with the Japanese Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Tax and Fujisoft, all in Japan",,,
"So great progress, again, on the international front",,Positive,Confident
"As far as partner momentum, we continue to strengthen our partner ecosystem",,,
"In fact, we are seeing partners grow their salesforce practices by more than 50%",,,
"Today, every single one of the top five SIs in the world run their business on salesforce",,,
We have an incredible partnership with them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"In the quarter, they expanded their relationship with us, rolling out sales, service, analytics and of course, the salesforce platform",products_services,,
We're also seeing strong momentum in our ISV community and the innovation around our platform in that community,,Positive,Confident
"In fact, today nearly 90% of the Fortune 100 are running apps from the AppExchange and these are apps that are being installed by customers at a rate of more than one per minute every single day, which is pretty incredible",,,
"Now before I wrap up, I want to say how proud I am of the company and our ability to integrate more than a dozen acquisitions in FY 2017 while still delivering really record-breaking results",acquisitions,,
"And look, this operational excellence, it's already paying off",,,
We're driving incredible value and innovation for our customers,,,
"In fact, this quarter, we had a huge set of Commerce Cloud wins with Levi's and The Gap and YETI and many, many others",,,
"And Commerce Cloud grew customer gross merchandise value by 26% in constant currency from a year ago, again, an acceleration from Q3. So look, in summary, I would tell you that no other technology company is building the relationships that we are",,,
We are driving incredible innovation,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're bringing huge value to our customers,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We continue to inspire our customers,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We continue to paint a vision for their success, and as I said, we are executing at scale across every part of the company and delivering success for our customers better than anybody else in the world",,,
"And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Kash, hi, it's Keith",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So thank you for the complex multipart question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'll lead off with this part,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So as you know, we did a dozen plus acquisitions in FY 2017; the integration has gone incredibly well as we continue to operate the company at scale and growth","sales,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
We have a standard template and process when we integrate these companies in all lines of business,,,
"So for example, in the go-to-market business aspect of the company, we try to keep these companies together because we want to incubate them",,,
We want to grow them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We want to nurture them,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We want to bring them into our culture, but we also want to make sure that we allow or we put them in a position where we can attach to the install base and the customer",,,
So they can get the power of salesforce when they come into the company,,,
We've seen some great success,not_applicable,Positive,Confident
"A good example of that is the Demandware acquisition, now called Commerce Cloud",acquisitions,Positive,Confident
The GMV growth was excellent,sales,Positive,Confident
We signed up some great business in the quarter,not_applicable,Positive,Confident
But it's â€“ because we have a standard model from an operational perspective on how we bring these companies in so that we minimize disruption and we try to get them to hit the ground running as fast as we can,,,
"Well, I think that the â€“ I think it's pretty clear that customers â€“ the company over the last 18 years has had an incredible vision and consistently has delivered new innovation to the marketplace",,,Uncertain
"Obviously, pioneer in cloud, and bringing sales Cloud to the market 18 years ago was a great start",,Positive,Confident
It was a first act,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Many companies never get beyond that first act,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We've gotten beyond the first act, the second act, the third act, the fourth act, and we're well into our fifth act-plus around innovation and Einstein is certainly a great example of that",,Positive,Confident
"If I looked at use cases for Einstein, overall, I would tell you that this is really bringing insight to action across sales and service and marketing and commerce, if you think about opportunity insights or account insights, predictability scoring, et cetera, et cetera",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"I mean, I can go through every one of the lines of business",,,
"But at the end of the day, yet again, you're painting a vision for our customers and providing them with a very compelling technology to get insights about their customers and what sort of use cases that that technology can be applied to",,,
So every customer that I've spoken with is hugely excited about the potential for Einstein and what it means to their business models and their business,,,
And we're just starting to see the beginning of it,,,
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, hi, it's Keith, let me take this",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, look, we put a premium on what we refer to as enablement, right? We bring a lot of people into the company, 5,000-plus people this year",,,
"And we spend an incredible amount of focus time making sure that our people â€“ all of our people are brought up to speed on the features and functions of any of our cloud, take Service Cloud as an example since it's the one that you asked about",products_services,,
"And we take advantage of some amazing technology; Trailhead is an example, so we're making sure that we can bring people up to speed and hit the ground running very quickly",,,
So this is an ongoing thing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We don't just train somebody once and then that's it,,,
There's no end of job when it comes to the training and enablement,,,
"As I said, I think it's one of the reasons why we're so different than the rest of the marketplace in terms of the effectiveness of our go-to-market teams",,,Uncertain
"And specifically on Service Cloud, look, we're the market leader, okay? So we had amazing growth",products_services,Positive,Confident
The Magic Quadrant,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're the market leader of the Magic Quadrant with Gartner, if you take a look at that",,,
This is a $2.5 billion run rate business,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It is â€“ after sales Cloud, it is the largest cloud, I guess you could say, company in the world in terms of size and scale",,,
"And again, we're taking market share",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're number one in the marketplace,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So we've got incredible capabilities,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We continue to improve the product,products_services,,
"We're enabling our sales teams and our customers' success teams, and I think it shows up in our results",,,Uncertain
Let me talk about that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So we're in an enviable position where we're a market leader in every cloud that we make and produce and bring to the market, and that drives incredible amounts of customer success into the marketplace for our customers",,,
And that is where we are laser-focused,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And when we go to market, we go to market on a solution basis, which is typically a multi-cloud solution",,,
"So that could be by industry, that could be by line of business",,,
"But when I think about, for example, the top 10 deals in the quarter, I can tell you that 8 of the top 10 deals in our quarter in Q4 had multi-cloud solutions",,,Uncertain
So that means it wasn't just sales Cloud,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"It was sales Cloud and Service Cloud, or it was Marketing Cloud and communities, or it included Analytics, et cetera",products_services,,
"So again, customers are buying solutions",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"They buy solutions because they're looking to solve a business problem, and we are uniquely positioned to solve those business problems in the marketplace as it relates to customer engagement",,,
So we're in a great product position,products_services,Positive,Confident
We have an excellent execution strategy which I outlined in the call earlier,,,
"And yeah, just to give you an example, I talked a lot earlier about the level of relationships that we're establishing with these customers",,,
"When I talked about achieving this goal of 100 $10 million-plus relationships and doubling the number of $20 million-plus relationships, just to put that into perspective, if you go back to â€“ I joined the company back in FY 2014 â€“ and again, I had the privilege of working with an amazing team and an amazing company",,,
"But to put that in perspective, fast forward to where we are today",,,
"We have three times, three times the $10 million-plus relationships with customers than we had back in FY 2014. We have five times the $20 million-plus relationships that we had back in FY 2014. Well, how did that happen? Well, it happened because we had a compelling vision",,,
"It happened because we had a multi-cloud portfolio that added a lot of value, incredible value, that allowed these customers to drive digital transformation and engage with their customers in entirely new ways, in unprecedented ways",,,
So there is an incredible amount of opportunity on an attach basis across all of our clouds,,,
"We're seeing more and more demand for it, and we are uniquely positioned to provide that for our customer base",,,
Absolutely,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think it's listening,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Listening is very, very important, but also it's bringing a point of view, whether it's an industry perspective or a line of business perspective, as I said before",,,
"At the end of the day, let's use consumer packaged goods, in a quarter, three out of the top five consumer packaged goods companies in the world, and these are massive companies",,,
These are brands that we all know and we'll talk a little bit about that next week,,,
They are expanding their relationships,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
They are betting their business on salesforce,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So this is Keith,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Look, we talked about this earlier",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
CRM is the fastest-growing enterprise market and we're the market leader,,,
We continue to separate from the rest of the marketplace,,,
There's a number of reasons for that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Obviously, it starts with a compelling vision, an incredible execution and operations of scale",,,
But we started off the year with a fantastic quarter,,,
"We're certainly very, very proud of the entire company and are very thankful to our employees, and all of our â€“ really all of our stakeholders",,,
But we have some momentum carrying into the quarter,,,
"And I think that's reflected in our forward guide, which I think Marc and Mark talked about",,,Uncertain
So there's a lot of momentum,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We're very excited,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We've got a great story, a compelling vision for our customers and we continue to execute in an unprecedented way, better than anybody else in the marketplace",,Positive,Confident
"Marc, I don't know if you want to add",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Thank you so much, John",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I really appreciate it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And before I begin the script and talking about our quarter, I really wanted to review something that I sent to the Company last week, regarding some of the things that weâ€™ve been seeing in the world",,,
And I thought it would be appropriate if we just took one minute and just allowed you to hear these words as well,,,
As the world has watched with all of us the horrors of the last week taking place in the United States and Spain,,,
The pure hatred that we have seen displayed is everything we all want to end,,,
And Iâ€™ve been especially disheartened to see the display of symbols of hatred including Nazi flags and salutes to KKK hoods,,,
The horrible tragic death of Heather Heyer was a senseless act of terror and this hatred must end now,,,
"salesforce is a company that is built on the values of love, equality and generosity",,,
We work hard every day to improve the state of the world through our own work and promote our Companyâ€™s mission to others,,,
We all have to recommit to our own personal acts of love and kindness as this is the only way to fight this pure hatred,,,
"We can all make our own choices between love and hate, and we can all love more",,,
"Now is the time for all of us to remember, love thy neighbor as thyself",,,
Thank you very much for allowing me to say that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And now, Iâ€™d like to move into the quarter",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We had our best quarter ever and we reached a huge milestone for the company,,,
"As you might remember, two and a half years ago, I talked about our dream of surpassing $10 billion in revenue",sales,,
"And at that time, we were just on a $5 billion revenue run rate",sales,,
While I can remember how many employees and customers and partners came up to me and said there is no way you are going to get to $10 billion,,,
"What kind of a dream is this? And now, I am absolutely thrilled that in the second quarter we broke through the $10 billion run rate, doubling the Company in such a short time",,,
"Now, salesforce is the first enterprise cloud software company in the history of the industry to reach the $10 billion run rate",,,
"No competitor has pierced $10 billion this fast, not Oracle, not Microsoft, not SAP and certainly not which has $15 billion of deferred revenue on and off the balance sheet",sales,,
This makes salesforce the fastest growing enterprise software company ever to reach this milestone,,,
And this incredible achievement is now coupled with an incredible dream,,,
We now set our sights on $20 billion and doubling the Company again,,,
"And you can see today how we can get there organically with our unmatched product portfolio, world-class team, and as I mentioned $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet","products_services,organic_expansion",,
"While this was a phenomenal quarter of growth, we continue to improve our profitability, executing at scale and we remain the fastest-growing of all the top five enterprise software companies","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"Now, letâ€™s talk about some of the highlights of the quarter",,,
"revenue for the quarter rose to almost $2.6 billion, which was up 26%, and we are heading fast to $20 billion in revenue",sales,,
"As I mentioned, we have more than $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, thatâ€™s up 29% from a year ago",,,
"In fact, we added more than $3 billion to this balance since last year",,,
"Based on these strong results, we are raising full year top-line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.4 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth for this dream, and I will tell you personally, Iâ€™ve got dreams of 25%",sales,Positive,Confident
This is the second quarter in a row we have raised our revenue guide by a $100 million and only the third time in our history,sales,,
"Now, there is a reason for our incredible success year-after-year and why we continue to be investing at such an incredible rate to be the number one CRM company, is because no other company like ours has ever been as committed to customer success as salesforce, and thatâ€™s reflected in how our customers are driving tremendous success for their customers",,,
"You all know that customer relationship management, whether itâ€™s B2B or B2C, has already become the most important and fastest-growing enterprise software category, growing at nearly 14%, and thatâ€™s going to come for years to come",,,
"Well, itâ€™s a massive $100 billion plus opportunity that salesforce is leading, and we are in a phenomenal position going forward",,,
We all see the $1 trillion CRM opportunity in front of us,,,
"Now, we see that by our -- through our number one position and thatâ€™s because we are number one in CRM, number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, and we have the number one platform that we have a tremendous opportunity to deliver on these goals",products_services,,
"And we are delivering this at a scale every single day, creating nearly 3 million sales opportunities, more than 5 million customer cases sending 1.4 billion emails, processing 1 million purchases, and producing 40 million reports and dashboards every single day, thatâ€™s 1 billion reports and dashboards a month, by the way, all while delivering more than 5 billion platform transactions a day",,,
And itâ€™s no wonder that Forbes just named salesforce the most innovative company in the world again,,,
"We were the first to bring innovations like cloud and social and mobile to CRM, and now weâ€™re the first to deliver artificial intelligence to all of our customers with Einstein, right inside our core platform across all of our products",products_services,,
This is a massive $1 trillion growth opportunity,sales,Positive,Confident
"According to IDC, the combination of CRM and IA - excuse me, according to IDC, the combination of CRM and AI will create more than $1 trillion in new GDP impact worldwide; 800,000 net new jobs by 2021, amazing",,,
"And weâ€™re already seeing how Einstein is a game changer for customers, delivering hundreds of millions of critical insights, recommendations and predictions every single day",,,
"But, our biggest advantage is more than 27,000 talented employees of salesforce, these incredible people who are focused on making our customers successful with our products",products_services,,
No other company can match this level of focus on the CRM market,,,
"All of this adds up to salesforce, becoming increasingly strategic to our customers and to our partners who are trusting us to bring them into this incredible new future",,,
Youâ€™ll hear more about that in a second from Keith,,,
"While itâ€™s only August, weâ€™re officially on the road to Dreamforce, which is going to take place in San Francisco, November 6th through 9th, and itâ€™s going to be the most exciting, most inspirational and most innovative Dreamforce ever",,,
And I hope all of you can be there; youâ€™re not going to want to miss one moment,,,
"Okay, Keith",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Thank you very much for asking that question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think that when we think about earnings, and obviously we have this incredible top line growth, and there is one word that really comes to mind and thatâ€™s balance, which is that itâ€™s incredibly important as we grow our company and exceed these incredible revenue targets that we also continue to grow our bottom-line","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
And I am sure that Mark will address the specifics of how much weâ€™ve grown our bottom line in the last few years,earnings,,
"But one of the things that continues to be on our minds is, how -- what are the ways that we can grow our margin while also continuing to grow our top line, and weâ€™re absolutely committed to doing both","sales,earnings",,
And I think thatâ€™s on the mind of every single member of our management team,,,Uncertain
I think weâ€™ve continued to deliver those numbers actually very well and weâ€™ll continue to do that going forward,,,Uncertain
"And thatâ€™s also under the guise of pressure that we get from foreign exchange, like every time the euro increases, its valuation that puts more pressure on our bottom-line",,,
"Mark, do you want to address?",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Iâ€™d like to think of this investing in growth by design and enhancing our profitability every step of the way,"sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"Well, let me take the last question first, which is that salesforce actually gets its data from a lot of different places",,,
"More than half of the transactions, when we talk about 5 billion transactions a day, more than half of those transactions are API transactions already, thatâ€™s other computers filling our database with data",,,
And we have just amassed a huge amount of customer data based on that,,,
We have so many integrations and so many customers so deeply integrated,,,
And then there is many different ways that customers get their information into our system,,,
"Of course, we have many natural language type systems like one you mentioned, voice type systems like youâ€™ve seen us do work with Alexa, with Amazon and I think you will continue to see an evolution of that",,,Uncertain
One area that I am especially proud of is mobile,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I donâ€™t think any enterprise software company has done as good a job with mobile as salesforce,,,Uncertain
"salesforce has -- with salesforce1, with My salesforce1, salesforce Inbox, many of our mobile offerings and mobile platform capabilities, more mobile capability than any other enterprise software company",,,
And that has really allowed customers to access and work with an input data in lots of new ways,,,
"Because mobile devices are empowered and enabled to so many kind of, I would say, next generation capabilities including many operating systems that have very deep AI, as you know, all of that is already tied into salesforce",,,
"So, itâ€™s a very extremely powerful",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think that number one for us, here we are, weâ€™re blasting through $10 billion, all of you have your models for salesforce, you can plug these preferred revenue numbers into your models and do your calculations of where our revenues going to be in each of the next several years",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And Iâ€™ll tell you, we took our whole management team offsite two weeks ago to lay out our plan for what we call chapter three",,,
"Chapter one for us certainly was zero to $1 billion, itâ€™s well documented in the book Behind the Cloud, how we did it, what we did, all of those capabilities",,,
We want to write a second book now for entrepreneurs of what we did from $1 billion to $10 billion,,,
We think thatâ€™s an important story that needs to be told,,,Uncertain
Thatâ€™s certainly chapter two,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Now, weâ€™re in chapter three, which is to go from $10 to $20 billion",,,
And Iâ€™m sure all of you can see thatâ€™s going to happen in fairly short order,,,
I think that one of the things that we have done to focus on and make sure that we blast through $10 billion is to focus on customer success,,,Uncertain
I think a lot of mistakes that the other entrepreneurs have made and I can go through each one,,,Uncertain
"In enterprise software specifically, itâ€™s not to really double down at this point, again on the customer",,,
"Get absorbed in your own myopia, get absorbed in your corporate politics, get absorbed in your corporate bureaucracies and yourselves, and try to break out of yourself and recognize the most important thing, continues to be the customer",,,
"And how do we enable that customer and empower that customer and of course, weâ€™re going hold ourselves accountable and weâ€™re also going to deliver all kinds of other capabilities along the way as well",,,
"But, that is really our focus, which is how do we make our customers more successful than ever",,,
And I think thatâ€™s the heart of our culture,,,Uncertain
"We have a great culture at salesforce, itâ€™s a culture built on our core values of trust, of growth, of innovation, of quality",sales,Positive,Confident
But I think nothing is more important to our Company than customer success,,,Uncertain
"And even though the vast majority, letâ€™s say half of the 27,000 employees that work for us today probably were not with us two years ago",,,
So that is something that we really have to spend time with them at,,,
Weâ€™re different than other software companies because we really care about that customer and weâ€™re going to make sure that customer is successful,,,
"When youâ€™re an enterprise software, you have to realize, itâ€™s hard work, not everything is going to be perfect all the time, there is going to be problems",,,
Thatâ€™s why being so committed to the customer I think is more important than ever,,,Uncertain
"And I think thatâ€™s why youâ€™re going to see extraordinary growth for years to come, because of this culture thatâ€™s really driving it forward",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
And then we coupled it with this incredible CRM opportunity,,,
And I have to say our competitors have really done a horrible job in last few years,,,
I just would say that a lot of them have abandoned the CRM market,,,
"If you talk to the major CRM analysts and we do that, we just had one of them at our management conference, they are shocked, weâ€™re shocked of how these companies have really walked out of the CRM market, companies that had huge multibillion dollar positions in the CRM have ceded that market to us",,,
"And thatâ€™s very exciting when you look at the huge investments that weâ€™ve made, not just in product but also distribution","products_services,organic_expansion",,
More than half of our organization is a customer-facing organization,,,
We sell directly and service directly to the customer,products_services,,
That is going to serve us very well for years to come,,,
"So, I feel very good and I think you can see it in the numbers here",,,Uncertain
"As I said, weâ€™re here forecasting 24% growth for the year thatâ€™s our official guidance",sales,Positive,Confident
I have personal dreams of 25%,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I think that would be amazing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
No software company kind went through the $10.4 billion number at these rates,,,
"And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsoftâ€™s growth over 30 years, salesforceâ€™s growth, Oracleâ€™s growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories",sales,Positive,Confident
And I feel that thatâ€™s going to continue to happen,,,Uncertain
"Well, the platform strategy has evolved over time",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, one of the cool things for us is we have a tremendous capability with our platform",,,
And that really started with this idea that we are building these amazing CRM apps like sales and service app but our customers wanted apps really designed for them,products_services,,

"Per an earlier question, notwithstanding the year-to-year differences, the semiconductor industry has had a fairly steady growth rate and with steady R&D expenditures, and therefore fairly steady EDA growth all in all",sales,Positive,Confident
"Within individual product groups, and especially when you connect them together in coherent platforms, there are actually very big changes in products in a matter of two to three years as on moves to the next generation",products_services,,
And these changes invariably are around finding a way to dramatically improve one of three characteristics,,,
"Either characteristics of the quality of results, meaning the power of the chips or the performance of the chips, or the time to results, meaning make the product run much faster, or the cost of results which is reduce the area of chips","op_costs,products_services",,
These evolutions are not linear because often you work for two or three years on a set of profound algorithms and then suddenly it makes a difference,,,
"If you look at a little bit higher level, and this is where sort of intersects with the strategy for a Company, the big inflection points from my perspective have been the addition of the IP business to EDA",,,
"And this, of course, now already quite a number of years ago but now it is a significant portion of our business",,,
Iâ€™ve alluded the last couple of years to the inflection that is coming with the addition of the software side of hardware-software,,,
And itâ€™s not a surprise that so many of the verification expenditures are increasingly focusing on that,,,
And then we have predicted that the software side itself would go through this by virtue of the complexity growth,sales,Positive,Confident
And so that is how we are looking at our opportunity space,,,

"Well, listening to my predictions through your mouth, I almost feel clairvoyant because indeed the deals did get larger",,,Uncertain
And thatâ€™s not surprising because this is the same history as EDA many years ago or many other fields where automation and verification takes hold,,,
"And yes, it takes hold faster with people that look forward and so on",,,
But really it happens very often when people have a catastrophe or an issue to deal with,,,
"On the services side, youâ€™re right, we mentioned that then",products_services,,
"And to be honest, I donâ€™t recall if we were completely engaged with Cigital at that point in time already",,,
"But we have felt for a while that the issues around security are so large that when you get the opportunity to talk to, letâ€™s say, the CIO or CSO or CTO of a large Company, and they tell about all the security issues, the next answer is, well, we have this one product, why donâ€™t you just buy some, feels pretty shallow",products_services,,

"Everything around us is becoming smart, connected but also complex",,,
"Mounting software content, whether integrated on a chip or as an app, creates huge functionality, development and security challenges",,,

Core EDA revenue growth has outpaced competitors over the past years,sales,Positive,Confident
IP continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion,sales,Positive,Confident
Let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with core EDA,,,
Synopsys is a mission-critical partner for the most advanced designs,,,
Our EDA and IP collaboration with TSMC illustrates this,,,
"During Q2, we announced full flow certification for TSMC's 12- and 7-nanometer processes as well as broad IP cooperation for 12-nanometer FinFETs",,,
Customers today rely on Synopsys for more than 95% of their FinFET designs,,,
"Meanwhile, we-re already partnering on early R&D of 5-nanometer and below",,,
Our design platform is generating solid results and notable customer successes,,,
"IC Compiler II, our place and route solution, is used on highly complex chips, some as advanced as 7-nanometer, by companies such as Xilinx, NVIDIA, ST and Broadcom",,,
"IC Validator, our physical verification product, has already performed final sign-off of more than 100 FinFET production tape-outs, a significant accomplishment given the historical reliance on competitors",products_services,,
"Meanwhile, intensive R&D across our digital platform is delivering new high-impact capabilities at a very rapid pace",,,
"In custom, our long-time leadership in simulation and our new Custom Compiler design solution are generating high interest",,,
"Custom Compiler's FinFET optimizations and our close collaboration with UMC, for example, enabled customers to use Custom Compiler in their new 14-nanometer process",,,
"At our March user group conference, ST, MediaTek and Renesas shared their production successes with engineers from more than 40 companies",products_services,,
"In verification, we continued to see excellent results and a strong outlook for the year",,Positive,Confident
"Our Verification Continuum platform is in high demand for 2 reasons, first, we have leading-edge verification technologies ranging from simulation to emulation to prototyping to static techniques to powerful, well integrated debugging; and second, our coherent platform is solidly centered at the intersection of hardware and software, the very intersection enabling Smart Everything and addressing the time-to-market urgency of this dynamic market",,,
We continue to see great progress ranging from excellent customer interest in our new superfast VCS simulator to platform-wide adoption and proliferation,,Positive,Confident
"Over the last several quarters, leading mobile, graphics and processor companies have aligned with us through expanded multi-year strategy -- strategic agreements, including simulation, verification IP, debug, formal, emulation and prototyping technologies",,,
"In Q2, broad demand for ZeBu emulation continued with 6 new logos and expansion in top accounts",organic_expansion,,
"For example, Spreadtrum standardized on ZeBu for its advanced mobile SoCs and Wave Computing adopted ZeBu for its machine learning products",products_services,,
"While lumpy from quarter-to quarter, we expect 2017 to be another record year for hardware revenue, driven by industry demand and the robustness of our solution",sales,,
"On top of this, virtual prototyping which enables early software development and architecture assessment, resonated particularly well in the automotive market",,,
"During the quarter, we announced support for chips from Silicon Mobility Inc",,,
", a leading semiconductor provider for hybrid and electric vehicle control systems",,,
"Let me pause for a moment on automotive, where, over the past several years, we've deployed a wide range of targeted solutions",,,
"With touch points ranging from functional safety to autonomous driving to the next-generation of infotainment, all the way to lighting simulation, Synopsys is growing into a crucial participant in the automotive ecosystem",,,
"Elements throughout our EDA, IP and software integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety defined by the ISO 26262 standard",,,
"In IP, for example, over the last 8 quarters, we significantly extended our portfolio of certified IP",,,
"More broadly, in Q2, we saw strong demand in IP with particular momentum in advanced technology and security",,Positive,Confident
We announced an expansive portfolio of IP for TSMC's 12 FFC process and taped out multiple 10- and 7-nanometer IP test chips with advanced foundries,,,
"We're systematically building out our portfolio of security IP for mobile, automotive, IoT and cloud computing markets",,,
"In Q2, for example, we delivered a high-performance, hardware-secure module that protects sensitive information and data processing within SoCs",,,
"The need for security is, of course, much broader than IP which brings me to our third customer base, software developers across many industries",,,
The focus in our growing Software Integrity Group is to provide products and services that help developers write high-quality code that can withstand security vulnerabilities,products_services,,
This as a key differentiator and new TAM for Synopsys and I'm happy to report that it's scaling well both organically and via acquisitions,"organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
Our software sign-off platform is making good progress and we have expanded our road map to reflect the acquisition of Cigital,acquisitions,Positive,Confident
We're strong in the embedded space with growing transaction sizes and are gaining good traction in the automotive industry with our security solutions and well-respected expertise,,Positive,Confident
"With the acquisition of Cigital in Q1, we're accelerating penetration in other key verticals such as the financial services industry","products_services,acquisitions",,
Our objective is to drive demand creation at early stages of security strategy development,,,
The Cigital integration is already delivering examples of our first combined services and product agreements and cross-selling opportunities,products_services,,
"Finally, Synopsys was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for application security testing",,,
The Magic Quadrant is an important indicator for customers who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors,,,
We've already seen increased customer interest as a result,,,
"In closing, as we look to the second half of the year and beyond, our priorities remain centered on generating long term shareholder value",,,
"We do this by investing organically and through M&A and EDA, IP and software integrity to realize our Silicon to Software vision","organic_expansion,acquisitions",,
We do this by executing with a clear intent to sustain technology leadership while simultaneously growing revenue and profitability throughout our business,"sales,earnings",,
"And we do this with a clear bottom line objective and many year track record, of driving ongoing high single-digit EPS growth and returning cash to shareholders","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
Let me now turn the call over to Trac,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, in general, I think we're in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas, we always look at it from a perspective of a multi-year outlook because that's sort of the only fair way to do it, all the more given that we have a multi-year agreement",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"Having said that, there's no question that the push towards more advanced chips is actually continuing strong and I think the reason for that is relatively straightforward which is that the new opportunities in technologies and products are using any of the existing computation and mobility techniques but now amended by increased digital intelligence requirements, will continue to be very strong after that enormous amounts of data generated by a happily growing set of sensors",products_services,Positive,Uncertain
And you can see that the entire field is really poised to demand more computation,,,
"And so it is natural, therefore, for people to come to our products",products_services,,
"And while there are some up and down from quarter-to quarter, they are driving the leading edge and they need the tools to support that",,,
So I think we're fortunate to do well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It feels like repetitive in the last 3 or 4 earnings releases,earnings,,
"We must have used the word hardware is lumpy every time and that is an indication that the visibility is not complete, meaning that some of these things come in and then the customer wants immediate fulfillment or delayed fulfillment",,,
So the timing can be somewhat arbitrary,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
There's no question that we have done well in the hardware area and I think that correlate directly to what we said earlier which is growth in complexity of chips but also more and more chips and the affiliated software needing to be verified together,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
And that is only a center of strength for Synopsys,,,
"Actually, the first two groups because in order for emulation and other hardware isolation methods to be useful, it is really in the proximity of the intersection of hardware and software which means it's the high-end chips that invariably drive a lot of software or it is the systems companies that integrate multiple chips around building apps or building entire product",products_services,,
"And so the distinction between semiconductor vendors and system vendors sometimes is a little blurred because they tend to increasingly do stuff for each other or demand from each other that, that sits at this intersection",,,
"So both of those, I think, sort of grow hand in hand",,,Uncertain
"Actually, sorry I forgot that part of your question",,,
IP is directly related to efficiency and productivity,products_services,,
"And with continuous complexity of chips and by the way, continued complexity of the IP blocks, delayed collection of these blocks just continues to grow and the efficiency with which people can put together large chips is directly a function of which blocks are available, how easy is it to integrate them and how much do you trust the vendor because, obviously, you're highly relying on who provides you those blocks",,,
"And so as companies design large chips or larger systems, increasingly, they put their engineers on those aspects that they can't purchase but where they can provide additional differentiation while outsourcing increasingly blocks that, in the past, they would have done themselves",,,
And I think that bodes very well for us,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I have not seen any seasonality,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think it is very much project based and it has always a little bit the characteristic that the minute they figure out what's going to be in the project, they would like to have the IP the next day which, of course, not possible because a lot of this gets developed as part of agreements and service development sets",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
But the projects come and go,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The companies have no aligned time line for these projects and so I don't see any seasonality,,,
"But one could have the configuration that, for some reason, there are some quarter, there are more project finishing than others or deliveries that we could do",,,
"So it could be somewhat lumpy, but it's not because of seasonality",,,
They are completely ready for the 7-nanometer,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
5-nanometer is not on the market and 5-nanometer is still in deep development,,,
That will take a little while,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And even when I say for the 7-nanometer -- 7-nanometer is really leading edge and what that means is that the foundries that provide the technology and that manufacture these chips will keep refining their technology on ongoing basis because they constantly are trying to tune the yields that they get because if you have a little higher yields, meaning a higher percentage of chips that work on a wafer, that has enormous economic impact",,,
And so we-re in constant interaction with foundries,,,
"Every time that they tune it a little bit, we tune our tools and in some cases, we also tune our IP a little further",,,
"Yes, we have a number of efforts in these advanced nodes and the word ready is not a black and white, meaning that there are certain things that are already earlier",,,
"There are certain things that are already with 7-nanometers, not quite there, for test chips, for example",,,
And so there's a very complex multi-year process to bring something to market,,,
"But from my commentary, you should read that we-re well exercised in trying to align as much as possible with the foundry train so that we arrive at the station at the same time",,,
It doesn't matter that much,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
There are some very fundamental IP that's impacted by EUV,,,
"And as you may know, EUV is sort of now just slowly seeping into potentially some production manufacturing in the coming years and that is only for a few layers of the chip",products_services,,
"And there are many, many layers, so EUV will be for the very refined ones initially",,,
"And so we're well on top of that, but it does not mean a big effort nor a big issue",,,
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Just to clarify, when we do IP, people buy existing functionality but very often wanted to be delivered in a very specific form, maybe with some alterations or with some tuning for their versions of technology",,Neutral,Uncertain
And so this is why the IP is accompanied by a statement of work which can be viewed essentially as a service business,products_services,,
But it is service business around an existing product,products_services,,
And the reason you saw us hesitate is because we rarely think about it in those 2 categories,,,Uncertain
But it is a good question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It is sort of a balance between the 2.,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yes, we have seen those since like the middle 1990s",,,
"We've been in China for a long, long time and they have been, for now many, many years, many design companies",,,
Many have not been successful,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so I would say, we're at least already on the third or fourth generation of companies where a bunch have disappeared, reconfigured and so on",,,
"And now there is a significant segment of strong Chinese companies that are -- that have, year after year, become closer and closer to be at the state of the art and we would certainly say that there are a few companies that are designing with absolutely state-of-the-art silicon technology",,Positive,Confident
And so they have been broad users of our tools,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
China has been a growing market for us and we continue to see expansion of that market,organic_expansion,,
Definitely yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I mean, memory development is development that requires pretty deep understanding of semiconductor physics and device construction",,,
"And so with the number of companies we have now been working for a while on the development of those, you're absolutely right that, in the last recent period, I would say maybe last 2 years, there has been an increase in attention and effort",,Neutral,Uncertain
"And that is the direct response to the fact that most economies are seeing an enormous amount of data coming about, that the big data will be analyzed and therefore, the -- be it in the cloud or be it the devices around it, are all going to use massively more memory and that their strong desire to make that memory a lot faster so that you can do more processing",,Positive,Confident
"And so in that sense, while China may be new to this game, the push in new memory technologies is quite interesting and that fits well the overall picture of a semiconductor business that is going to be an enabler to many other high-tech capabilities",,,
Good question,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I don't know the exact answer, but I can venture that it is probably half to a little bit more as outside",,,
And the reason for that is that the marketing needed in our core semiconductor space is not that high because we have many very good connections and we can relatively easily access people that need security and quality tools for their software,,,
"Whereas in the rest of the space, there are many different market segments",,,
"And you mentioned Cigital which is a really interesting acquisition because it's not only that it brings to us a service business, that allows us to engage at a higher level with customers that are looking at the strategy of their -- of how to deal with quality and security","products_services,acquisitions",,
It is that they're also very strong in the financial market,,Positive,Confident
"And so the way you communicate with financial market is very different than, let's say, the health market or the embedded software market and that is why some marketing effort has to be specialized on that",,,
"From a sales point of view, there, it is much more a question of global access and how quickly can we grow this and be in a situation where we have high-quality salespeople",,,
And that is an ongoing effort and going well,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We're growing well, but there's no end to that one yet",,,
"Well, so for being at Synopsys for 30 years, I would say our capacity has always been less than the customer wanted and more than they thought they would get, meaning that the state of the art is limited typically by a few things which is, one, is how fast can you run; and two, how much can you run at the same time",,,
"And so it has been actually quite remarkable how, over all this time period, these numbers have continued to increase",,,
"And I'm certainly on record of having argued many times that we-re the other half of Moore's Law which is if they can manufacture it, we will find a way to simulate it, to design it and so on and that goes hand in hand",,,
"But for the most state-of-the-art situations, one has always had the limit of what one can do",,,
"The second comment I would have for that, it is quite remarkable how, over all these years, over and over, there have been redesigns of architecture of utilization of compute environments, of utilization of multiple computers, multiple cores, multiple threads that have managed to keep your question in check",,,
So we're always chasing the horizon in other words and this is true on the hardware side in emulation or prototyping,,,
It is certainly true for software for a long time,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And expect that to absolutely continue and we will stay at the leading edge of that,,,
"Secondly, regarding the intersection of prototyping and software integrity, I expect that we're going to start seeing some of that in the not-too-distant future",,,
"So far, there's not been a lot of evidence of that, but we have not really pushed on that front yet either",,,
"The intersection between prototyping of emulation, we have already seen quite a bit of that",,,
"And by the way, it's intersection of prototyping, emulation and simulation and in some cases, even virtual prototyping",,,
And that is because the system people would like to simulate software on larger systems that have many components that may be defined at different levels of abstraction,,,
So all of this is being done,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I don't want to give the impression that this is routinely easy,,,
But we-re in a very strong position with this and the most advanced customers are very literate about this type of problems,,Positive,Confident
We have very strong hardware business,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"For starters, we're fortunate that our own processes around upgrading our firewalls, of making sure that all of the patches have been applied to software have been effective, so we have not had any issues with this",,,
"Very clearly, every time there is a big story, in this case, massive number of stories, the attention level around the notion of security goes up",,,
"And we-re sitting in the space where the idea is to design security in the first place, not to just fix all the things that went wrong in the past but make it essentially correct by construction",,,
"And so from that perspective, I think we-re in a very healthy situation",,,Uncertain
"If you amend that by the fact that Gartner which tracks many, many security-related companies such as ourselves, are now putting us in the leading quadrant for the activities that we do, obviously, the attention that this is getting is positive for our business even if it's negative for the world and so we-re seeing that with the acquisition of Cigital, with the commentary that Trac just gave you on the existing business",acquisitions,Positive,Uncertain
"I feel that we can now state that this business has, for lack of better term, reached critical mass",,,Uncertain
"And what I mean with that is that a number of years ago, we made the decision to move up from the silicon to the software",,,
"We made a decision to bank beyond the hardware and software intersection and that, moreover, this new TAM that touches many companies that, in the past, we have no business with looks very promising",,,
There were many execution challenges in getting there,,,
I think we've navigated well through those,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And I'm very encouraged with where we-re in the middle of 2017 because we see this vision materializing,,,
"And hopefully, it's not on the back of catastrophes around us but more on the premise that building correctly for the future is really where the software industry should go and that is where our contribution will be",,,
"Well, for the first part of your question, yes, we think that it is in the low double digits",,,Uncertain
"So far, the team has been executing particularly well and if you look at it from the complex chips, our expectations are that we will continue to see good growth and healthy business there",sales,Positive,Confident
"I'm sorry, I couldn't acoustically hear your second part of the question",,,
"Oh, yes, sure, sorry",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Yes, automotive has been an interesting area because it's having so much attention, frankly, by a whole number of people that may create a bit of a bubble there",,,
"But at the same time, there's a good reason it's getting so much attention which is it is the showcase for what modern hardware software will be able to do to fundamentally transform a field that has been relatively slow in evolving",,,
"It is now evolving very, very rapidly",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And so we have invested quite a bit over the last few years not only to make sure that the tools are capable of dealing with this type of designs, but our IP portfolio has grown significantly in the realm of having certified IP",,,
And certification of IP is for one key reason which is automotive demands a certain set of checks to make sure that what you're doing is actually safe,,,
"And in the past, safety has been actually developed quite well in automotive",,,
"With this very, very rapid increase of both hardware and software, the complexity that comes with that is going to be a challenge for safety and the fact that we have a portfolio that is now massively certified, I think, bodes very well for our position there",,,Uncertain
"Well, one of the key pieces is that the intersection of hardware and software has been driving verification extremely hard and a subcategory to that is really emulation and prototyping",,,
We refer to that as hardware,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And that growth has just been exemplary because so many people would like to run software on hardware they don't have and so instead, they use an emulator to sort of fake the hardware if you like",sales,Positive,Confident
"And I expect that to continue because if you want to go to market, you want to start the software development as soon as you possibly can and make sure that it's going to work with the hardware that takes a long time to manufacture",,,
So that has really been one of the key variables in this game,,,

"Customers such as MediaTek, Renesas, Panasonic, ST and TDK/Micronas have reported very successful deployments and tapeouts using our Custom Compiler solution, which is targeted specifically at FinFET designs",,,
"Now to verification, which continues to be an area of strength and growth for Synopsys",sales,Positive,Confident
"We realized a number of years ago that as chips and systems became more and more complex, verification would increasingly be required at the intersection of hardware and software",,,
"Over the last years, while collaborating with market leading customers, we developed a comprehensive verification platform that excels at exactly that",,,
"In fiscal 2017, our investments have resulted in another outstanding year of growth and share gains","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"One example is Samsung SARC, which chose our Verification Continuum, including simulation, formal, emulation, debug and verification IP as the primary solution for their advanced mobile processor designs",,,
Strong customer adoption of our hardware verification products drove another record year as well,products_services,Positive,Confident

"Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"Over the past 15 plus years, weâ€™ve built the broadest portfolio of IP titles and subsystems and have become a trusted partner and market leader",,,
Our foundry relationships and active drive in standards groups ensure that customers can buy leading-edge products in key technology processes at the earliest stages,products_services,,

Our vision and investments are resonating well with customers and weâ€™re excited about the long-term potential of this product group,"products_services,organic_expansion",,
"Lastly, Iâ€™ve mentioned a number of vertical markets this afternoon",,,
One key vertical that is going through momentous change and is directly impacted by our end-to-end solutions is automotive,,,
Let me provide some highlights resulting from our multiyear automotive strategy,,,
"Because safety is so critical, the automotive industry requires certification of products up and down their value chain",products_services,Negative,NIL
"Weâ€™ve significantly expanded our portfolio of products certified for standards such as ISO 26262, including our functional safety test solution, which was certified in Q4. During this year, weâ€™ve massively expanded our industry-leading automotive grade IP offering, including a broad portfolio of interface blocks that meet stringent automotive temperature requirements for the 16-nanometer FinFET process",products_services,Neutral,NIL
"In Q4, we extended a multiyear Automotive Center of Excellence collaboration with NXP, enabling early software development for next-generation electronic systems",,,
"Weâ€™re also well-recognized in the industry, serving as a leader on the Society of Automotive Engineersâ€™ Cyber Security Task Force focused on driving new standards for software security",,,
"In summary, for Synopsys, fiscal 2017 was an excellent year, positioning us well going forward",,,
"We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the Board",sales,Positive,Confident
"Our EDA and IP products are delivering top-notch results for customers building chips to bring about the Digital Intelligence, Smart Everything age",products_services,,
And weâ€™re making significant progress in scaling our software security platform and market leadership position,,,
Let me now turn the call over to Trac,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Yes,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, RISC-V is sort of in its beginnings, but it is also one processor among many being built right now",,,
"This is aimed, I think, at being more a general purpose processor and maybe of high interest to some parties",,,Uncertain
"But many people are focusing right now on the development of AI-specific processors, and so from our perspective as EDA and IP provider, itâ€™s a little bit like the more the merrier, because we can support many people doing designs, and we expect many processes to be optimized specifically for the applications, because the hunger for more speed will be so high that just going to smaller geometries will not be sufficient, and therefore, people will say, â€œHey, if I can build processors that are narrower and just aimed at some application and can make them faster,â€ and weâ€™re seeing really a plethora of companies investing in them",,,
"Well, I think, the answer is yes, yes, yes, because there is no question that the overall global economy has done well, mostly because all regions are reasonably solid and so having those in unison tends to help things",,,Uncertain
"Secondly, there is no question that semiconductor has had a very, very strong year",,Positive,Confident
"And in all fairness, this is after a few years of not being particularly strong and so these things tend to go up and down but up feels better than down, no question about that",,Positive,Confident
"And then, lastly, and I think that that is actually the factor that will matter most in the long-term is that, this move into this next wave of electronics enabling a very notion that was [indiscernible] in the â€˜90s of artificial intelligence and outcomes under a set of other names, big data, machine learning, digital intelligence, Iâ€™d like to call it Smart Everything, that will drive a very broad consumption of semiconductors, because the amounts of data generated by IoTs and various forms of sensors are growing by leaps and bounds, and just think of any camera as being really billions of pixels being generated",,,Uncertain
"Secondly, this data needs to be manipulated through machine learning, which is extremely compute in terms, and then the machine learning it in terms gets interpreted in the utilization, letâ€™s say inside of a car for example",,,
"And then on top of that, you need to add one more aspect, which is security",,,
"And security, there is a very, very big component to that in the software part of our business, but it also will impact hardware as a variety of security modules will get added",,,
"So, I think, that semiconductor is at -- really at the heart of enabling a whole new wave of impact and therefore would stay reasonably healthy just on that basis only",,,Uncertain
"Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we donâ€™t give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions","sales,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"And frankly, our first job is to always make sure that the company really lands well and that we can quickly look at what are the upsides for them with Synopsys or for Synopsys with them, that goes in both directions",,,
"Having said that though, I think, what is exciting about Black Duck is that, they are really have grown up and have impact to the whole aspect of software refer to as Open Source",,,Uncertain
"And one of the biggest productivity increases and this is true on chips with IP, I think, it is true on software by virtue of our use of software and Open Source software is, of course, the fact that you can use software for many sources and assemble it quickly",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"There are quite a number of lurking dangers in that and there is a large catalogue of known vulnerabilities, and when people integrate this Open Source code material and they donâ€™t pay attention to at least the vulnerabilities that already known, I think thatâ€™s closely delinquent when thinking about building secured software",,,Uncertain
And so itâ€™s just a natural for us as an extension of our focus on quality and security of software,,,
"Itâ€™s actually a quite difficult question, because we touch many, many companies that are in the automotive space and we ourselves find it a bit challenging to know exactly what is in the automotive part and what is in the regularly semiconductor deliveries",,Negative,Dodgy
"Having said that though, the reason I like to highlight automotive is because it is such a poster child for what big changes are happening in an industry that traditionally was very slow in the adoption of any super advanced technology and so many semiconductor technology",,,
"I highlighted specifically the fact that we had invested substantially in automotive certified IP in FinFET 16, because three years ago nobody in their right mind would have ever associated the word FinFET in automotive and today all of the big providers in that value chain are focusing on that, because they need more computation inside of the car",,,
"And so the investments that weâ€™ve made are not only to provide the tools that are suited for designing and modeling what goes into a car, but as you mentioned that also fulfill the existing standards that initially were all built up really for safety and only now are gradually being evolved towards security and those are words that we can certainly deal with very well",organic_expansion,,
So I think weâ€™re well-equipped to be a good provider in that value chain,,,Uncertain
"Well, I am always careful answering questions like that, because often the claims get out of hand quickly",,,
"We have extremely competent competitors like Cadence and Mentor, of course, are the largest ones",,,
"In some areas, Cadence has been growing a bit faster in digital design",,,
We have been growing faster in verification,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Things ebb and flow and go back and forth,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But in aggregate as an industry, weâ€™re quite competitive, because we have to constantly develop technology thatâ€™s at the leading edge",,,
"And so, I think, I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies, we are all striving to be a good providers in a market that right now is doing very well and so weâ€™ve had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
Youâ€™re welcome,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, a little bit everything you said is true, meaning that, thereâ€™s no question that when your customers do really well, they are a little less hesitant in spending money and semiconductors have been doing extremely well and I expected right now to continue for a bit",,,
"At the same time, the -- our solution in the verification space, the overall verification platform, which includes the emulation and the FPGA prototyping boards has done very, very well",,,
"And this is not completely a surprise, but somewhat difficult to predict in timing, because it follows what we have said, which is the center of gravity between hardware and software is going to increase in importance",,,
"With more complex software, people want to run the software before they have the hardware and therefore they model the hardware and thatâ€™s the basis that weâ€™re in",,,
"The third aspect I would mention is that, our IP business has been very strong and that is definitely partially the result of continued investment in the most advanced nodes, which is difficult IP to do",organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
"And as you probably know the advanced nodes keep rolling out at a rapid pace, because the providers are very competitive with each other",,,
"And last but not least, the Software Integrity platform, so far I think is living up to our open expectations to be good pillar for the company that is on one hand completely adjacent to what we already do both in terms of technology and complexity and in many cases in embedded situations",,,Uncertain
"On the other hand, itâ€™s clearly a fresh TAM for us as we were talking to customers that in the past we would never have dreamed of interacting with",,,
"Jokingly, I sometimes say, we now have customers from Samsung to Starbucks, in fact is itâ€™s actually true and so that is a very big opportunity space",,,
"This makes for a very long discussion, because we have -- we are now very, very rich in technologies in this domain",,,
"And this is a domain that has been extremely fractured in the past, and weâ€™re already starting to get I would say very strong positive feedback from the number of CIOs or people that are responsible for the security of software that being able to interact with a company that has longevity and some mass, gives them a better feeling of security that weâ€™re going to be around",,Positive,Confident
"Thatâ€™s just another way of saying, there is a lot of work ahead and we are continually integrating capabilities",,,
But it is after we really understand them well and so an integration is really a two-year to three-year process at many different levels,,,
"Having said that, Black Duck resonates very well with many of our customers and they understand immediately that doing some automatic checks on software that comes in from variety of not always understood sources is a good defense mechanism that they need and so, I think, that we will be well-equipped together with them to drive this area forward",,,Uncertain
Youâ€™re welcome,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, for starters, we always start to look at this via a multiyear perspective, because acquisitions like that, they take some time to integrate, they have haircuts, they have a number of complexities on the financial side that that need to be understood on a longer term perspective",acquisitions,,
We have actually a fairly well-honed process of trying to understand the value of the acquisition based on the cash flow that comes out of it over many years,acquisitions,,
"We donâ€™t disclose the exact metrics, but we have a fairly good discipline for that",,,
"We review this for many years after the acquisition with our Board, always with some up and some down surprises, which is another word of saying, itâ€™s always difficult to exactly predict",acquisitions,Negative,NIL
"But in aggregate, it has been part of how we continue to create value for the company and in that context Black Duck is not an exception",,,
"Our own sense is that this is a particularly valuable acquisition, because of the strategic position it fills technically in the portfolio, but also because of the very acute value it can create by reducing the risk profile for customers","acquisitions,op_risks",,
"So, that is the process that we follow",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Nothing is perfect and I am sure we can always do better, but we do have a long-term experience that has worked out pretty well for us",,,
"Well, this is an excellent question, because there are so many opportunities and your commentary is partially correct in that when we did the Cigital acquisition",acquisitions,,
Cigital was particularly focused on the financial sector,,,
"At the same time, my mentioning earlier of the automotive sector was interesting, because those people are just as interested in the issues of security and software as anything else",,,
The other areas that are also highly paranoid about what can happen medical is a good example and youâ€™ve seen some really horrific acts happening there,,,
"And so, I think, over time, no area, no verdict vertical is immune to the damages that can be done by essentially leaving the software doors wide open for hackers",,,Uncertain
And so this is going to become more and more a must do everywhere,,,
"But clearly, the sectors that are most sensitive also the ones that have been most attacked",,,
"And the financial sector, it quickly goes to the bottomline, because the attack means trying to steal money and that brings a very rapid reaction",,,
"So we are prudent in investing in verticals, because each vertical requires skills, it requires understanding the vocabularies and it requires understanding who to interact with",,,
"But I think our opportunity space will continue to grow and with is this part of our company broadening, we will put some more effort in understanding what are the best channels to do that, but so far I think weâ€™ve been executing reasonably well",,,Uncertain
Youâ€™re welcome,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, let me go backwards",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We continue, of course, to always look at opportunities, at the same time, itâ€™s also important to make sure that we executed well on the integration of the acquisitions that weâ€™ve done so far",acquisitions,,
"And while we have a number of teams that are extremely skilled at this, every case is different and so they take some time",,,
"And what is also interesting is that as we bring new members to our team, they bring fresh perspective, I like to call it fresh DNA that allows us to shop and how we think about the field",,,Uncertain
"To be honest on your TAM question, I sort of read the same reports that most people do and I am equally skeptical if the number reflects any reality, because when you have a very rapidly developing market where there are many, many different, very fractured companies, that typically indicates that thereâ€™s a high need and that the need is still not satisfied or still in development and those are actually all positive words, because thatâ€™s just coming opportunity, but it also says that adding up whatever these companies have been able to do and then extrapolating this mostly spreadsheet effort",,,
"And I donâ€™t want to be negative when people are trying to forecast it, because it is important, of course, but from our perspective, right now, the size of the TAM is the least of our issues",,,
"I think we have open space to run with and our challenge is how quickly can we execute on this, not are there more customers to call on, there are many more",,,Uncertain
"So at this point in time, first a big thank you for having reported on us and supporting us during the year",,,
"Fiscal â€˜17 turned out to be a very good year, not only from results point of view, but to most importantly from the perspective of preparing us for the next few years",,,
And by now it already feels a little old and so we are fully proceeding on like on 2018 and hope to talk to you soon,,,

Please turn to Slide 5 so we can discuss our results by segment and let me start with Transportation,,,
"The first quarter was an excellent quarter for our segment, with sales growing double-digits year-on-year and adjusted operating margins expanding 340 basis points on increased volume and productivity improvements","sales,earnings,products_services",,
Segment sales exceeded the expectations due to strength in China and Korea,,,
"Our auto sales were up 13% organically in the quarter, well ahead of auto production growth of 5% due to increased content from the secular trends we talked to you about around safe, green and connected, coupled with our very strong global leadership position","products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
Growth was led by demand from China as the expected expiration of government incentives spurred demand in the quarter,,,
"Note that these incentives are now being faced out over the course of the year, so as we look forward, we expect that vehicle production growth in China will continue to be front-end loaded in the first half of 2017. For the full year, we expect 4% growth in vehicle production in China and 2% growth in auto production globally",products_services,Positive,Confident
"While this assumption of 2% auto production growth globally is an increase from our prior view of 1%, this sell-side comes from the strength in the first half in China, with our outlook for the second half production being the same as our view 90 days ago",products_services,Positive,Confident
"For the full year, we expect to continue to outpace the growth of production due to the continued benefit of content growth as well as share gains",products_services,Positive,Confident
"Turning to Commercial Transportation, our team delivered another very strong quarter against still a tough backdrop",,Positive,Confident
"This was outperformance versus the market, with organic revenue up 16%, driven by a very strong heavy truck market in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations as well as share gains","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident

"When you think about the segment margin, our margin expectations remained the same for the segment and you should continue to think of steady state transportation operating margins as 20% plus or minus to 1. Please turn to Slide 6, so I can discuss our Industrial Solutions segment, which performed in line on both the top line and on the margin side in quarter one","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"Industrial solutions sales grew 12% on a reported basis, driven by the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and generated 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite the 80 basis points of headwind from the declines in oil and gas","sales,earnings,acquisitions",Negative,NIL
"If we had owned Creganna and Intercontec in the year ago period, our growth for this business would grow up at 16% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance of these acquired businesses",sales,Positive,Confident
"Industrial Equipment, we grew 1% organically, driven by strengthening market around the factory automation area as well as growth in medical","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Aerospace and defense remained strong with 4% organic growth, driven by increased content on new airframe builds as well as momentum in defense programs","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
Oil and gas declined 24% as expected due to the weakened market conditions and we feel that our oil and gas business has now bottomed and expect this business to remain stable at the current level as we benefit from new programs ramping later in the year,,,Uncertain
"Our energy business declined 3% organically, with growth in North America and Asia more than offset by the softness in Europe","sales,organic_expansion",Negative,NIL
"Adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations and expanded 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3%, which includes the oil and gas impact I mentioned earlier","sales,earnings",,

"In addition to the growth that we are excited about, data and devices also doubled its top earning adjusted margin from a year ago and we expect this business to be an increasing contributor to the profitability of the Communications segment going forward","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"On SubCom, the business declined slightly in the first quarter as a result of program timing",,,
Our momentum continues through this growth cycle and we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 based upon our very strong backlog,sales,Positive,Confident
"For the Communications segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.2% for the quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL

"If you would normalize for this impact, Communicationsâ€™ adjusted operating margins expanded significantly in the first quarter of â€˜17. And to really illustrate the progress that we have made in this segment over the past four quarters, adjusted operating margins have expanded from approximately 8% in the second quarter of last year to 13% in the quarter we just completed","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident

So let me turn it over to Heath and he will cover the financials,,,
"Thanks, Heath",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So now, I will get into our guidance for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2017. So, if you could please turn to Slide 10 and I will follow up with the quarter two outlook",,,
"We expect second quarter revenue of $3.025 billion to $3.125 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.09, representing sales growth of 4% on both the recorded and on an organic basis and 19% EPS growth at the midpoint","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"This guidance does include the impact of a stronger dollar, which we expect to be a $60 million headwind to sales and a $0.03 headwind to EPS on a year-over-year basis",,Positive,Confident
"Following two consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings per share and strong orders in the first quarter, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to also be a quarterly record and our guidance represents a strong first half of fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single-digits organically and low single-digits on a recorded basis due to the impact of the dollar","earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the second quarter, where exact growth will be driven by Asia and in Europe",products_services,Positive,Confident
Commercial transportation growth is expected to be driven by China,sales,Positive,Confident
"In industrial solutions, we expect to grow mid-teens overall through the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and we will be up low single-digits organically","organic_expansion,acquisitions",,
"And in communications, we expect mid single-digit organic growth, with growth in all three of our businesses","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
Now if you can turn to Slide 11 and let me cover full year guidance,,,
"Relative to our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our organic growth expectations for 2017 by 100 basis points and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, with better operational performance more than offsetting the headwinds from the strengthening dollar that Heath highlighted","sales,organic_expansion,op_risks",Positive,Confident
"While we are raising our guidance for the full year, we are maintaining our previous view of the second half by keeping our second half organic growth expectations consistent with our view, 90 days ago","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
I believe this is prudent given the uncertainty in the macro environment,,,
"And when you look at the implied trends for first half to second half, please keep in mind the impact of the stronger dollar and the tax dynamics that Heath mentioned earlier and we have some slide details in the back of slide material for your reference",,Positive,Confident
"For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.30 a share to $4.50 a share",sales,,
"This represents 3% reported growth, 4% organic growth on the top line and 11% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks of fiscal 2016. Relative to our prior view of revenue guidance, reported revenue growth is down 200 basis points due to the $300 million impact from the currency exchange rates","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Our organic growth is up 100 basis points, reflecting improvement in the transportation and communication segments","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"We are raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS from $4.34 to $4.40, which in essence, includes a $0.22 increase due to operational improvements and better performance from our acquisitions",acquisitions,,
Then this is offset by $0.16 of headwind from the stronger dollar,,Positive,Confident
"So really, highlighting the strong business model Heath and Tom talked about",,Positive,Confident
"I do feel very good about our ability to drive 4% organic growth, expand the operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points and generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this uncertain macro environment","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"This is an improvement and demonstrates as the portfolio is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses",sales,Positive,Confident
"While much of our operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by our transportation segment, I am pleased that in 2017 our operating margin expansion will be driven by all three segments, with more contribution from communications and industrial","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"So before the full year guidance and thinking through the segments, we expect transportation solutions to be up mid single-digits organically, on 2% auto production growth reflecting content growth trends and share gains","products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"We also expect commercial transportation to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market",organic_expansion,,
And we expect sensors to grow mid single-digits in total year-over-year,,,
"Industrial Solutionsâ€™ organic growth guidance is not changing from 90 days ago and we continue to expect growth to be up low single-digits organically, with continued gains in commercial aerospace and defense as well as medical","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Communications is expected to be up mid single-digits organically, an increase versus our prior year view due to the strength in appliances and data and devices",organic_expansion,,
"And as I mentioned earlier, weâ€™ve hit a milestone of improved performance in the D&D business",,,
Progress and growth and profitability is ahead of our prior expectations,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
We now expect organic growth for D&D in fiscal 2017 in the low single-digits and momentum in SubCom remains strong,"sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
And we continue to expect growth in the mid single-digits for the year in SubCom,sales,Positive,Confident
"Before I turn it back to Tom for closing comments, I do want to highlight that this is Tomâ€™s last earnings call as our CEO, after doing about 40 of these earnings calls with you all",earnings,,

"When you look at it, the first quarter what was a very strong quarter and it was driven at Asia",,Positive,Confident
"We saw I think, continued trends around sort of North America being flat, but we also did have growth in Europe",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"When you think through the content, itâ€™s broad based",,,Uncertain
"It is not one application and I think really when it comes to the perfect content and the share gains, it represents our strong global position that we have throughout automotive",,Positive,Uncertain
"I think when you look at the year, like I said in the guidance, we did expect automotive in the second half of the year production to slowdown versus the first half",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
We kept that the same,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We still feel when you get to the second half, while production globally, we assume to be relatively flat",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"We are going to still drive mid single-digit organic growth, improve that organic content and growth story","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"So itâ€™s just one of the elements of how production is with the strong Asia part in the first half, a lot of it is driven by China",products_services,Positive,Confident
"But the content along all the trends we have, whether itâ€™s electronification of the car, how the car gets more connected or around the green side of the car, how emissions and electronics get put them on",,,
"So it isnâ€™t one specific area, itâ€™s really the combination of all the trends we talked to you about",,,
"Hey Wamsi, itâ€™s Terrence again",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So as you know, we produce where our customers consume",,,
"So when you look at our footprint and a lot of the work that we have done to get our capacity to the right part that Tom and Heath talked about in their prepared comments, we feel very good about where our footprint is aligned with where our customers are",,,Uncertain
So we are fairly balanced when it comes to that element,,,
"How the border tax comes out, I think we all have to sit there and wait to see how that does",,,Uncertain
"When we sit there today, we like where we are positioned manufacturing wise and we will keep you all updated",,,
"Clearly, on things and tax related to repatriation, being a Swiss company, that doesnâ€™t really impact us positively or negatively",,,
"So from that viewpoint when we look at the guidance we gave you, itâ€™s pretty much a steady-state guidance as we think about it",,,Uncertain
"What I would say Craig, I think there is a couple of things",,,Uncertain
"One of the things, if you look to the quarter, itâ€™s very broad based across all our businesses",,,
And thatâ€™s something you havenâ€™t seen in a while,,,
"I would also say both through our direct customer relationships, I would also say our channel partners you will see some confidence in some of their activity",,,
The other thing that I would say is â€“ it is across â€“ all orders grew in all three regions,,,
"So there is to your view, some glimmer of I think it shows the background around our markets, but I would also say there is still uncertainty in the macro when you deal with things like the currency rates that while we have capped our back half the way it is from where we guided",,,Uncertain
"So when we sit there, I do think you are going to continue to see improvement",,,Uncertain
"Clearly, you are going to see improvement in our Industrial and Communications segment as we go through the year",,,
I think the order trends for some of the comments we made show very strong trends that we are excited about,,Positive,Uncertain
And then also the element around D&D growth,sales,Positive,Confident
Thatâ€™s not a headwind thereafter,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We did a lot of pruning to get that business focused on applications where we thought we could get paid for the great engineering and serve our customers for that we do,,Positive,Confident
"So I do think there are some positive glimmers of momentum not only in the business, but in the markets we serve",,,Uncertain
"So, I do think it feels a little different from the backdrop than it was a year ago or even during certain times last year",,,Uncertain
"Absolutely, certainly when you think about integrated products and where we bring [ph] sort of giving much more than just an interconnect product, but other technologies like sensors and sometimes even some of our cable technology on the material side, it does go broader than transmission",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"I know we use the transmission example as one to bring it to life, but it is then brake applications",,,
It is then track applications,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Itâ€™s throughout the auto, is where we get those",,,
So it is much broader than that and probably what we should do is break some of those and there is the life as we talk to investors,,,
I know we have been talking a lot about the transmission example,,,
"But Craig, I think the important point is, when you see the content growth that we are driving above production like we did in the first quarter and what we guided for the year in auto, it shows integrated solutions that help drive that content up",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Thatâ€™s why we have confidence that over time, what we do around $60 today, over the next 5 years, we can take up to that $80 range, not only from the trends that we benefit from, but also bringing those integrated solutions to our customers and we become more important to them and serve to many where they are in the world",,,

"Well and on the sensors, sensors actually â€“ we all know that, thatâ€™s running single-digit as we continue to invest ahead of the range that we have ahead of us that will begin in 2018. So we do think that, that will be a lever over time as those programs ramp, but we saw a significant investment in those programs",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain

Let me take both of those,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So letâ€™s start with oil and gas,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Number one is when you look at our oil and gas business, we basically are seeing stabilization",,,
"And that stabilization, we are happy to see certainly we hope upside comps as oil moves, but right now, I would say as we see it from the programs we are exposed to is much more around stabilization than I would say any ramp up",,Positive,Confident
"The other element that I would say when you think about our oil and gas business, it is very much around oceanic oil",,,Uncertain
"So pipelines, land-based, we are not strong in that",,Positive,Confident
"So on that, it is important to understand this is really around offshore oil and gas and the indicators around that are really offshore rigs",,,
"So where we see things right now is itâ€™s still stable in our guidance, and hopefully, we get some benefit from some of the things that President Trump is talking about that those kick in and help them back to get us little bit more upside in industrial",,,
But thatâ€™s not assumed right now,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On SubCom, we feel very good about where we are at",,,Uncertain
"Similar really, not much has changed since the last quarter",,,
Our guidance for the year is to be up 5% that will put us well over $900 million in revenue,sales,,
"Our backlog, we are booked for the â€“ so really when we look at the programs that we win throughout this year, itâ€™s really around 2018. So, 2017 is very locked and loaded",,,
"Our team is working very hard to execute to the backlog with where we are from an execution perspective and really program â€“ itâ€™s a pipeline of programs that we are quoting and trying to win, itâ€™s still very active",,,
"So we still think we are in a growth phase, but I would just say, right now, the 5% that we talked about last quarter being up year-over-year, even though we were down a little bit due to timing in the first quarter, we feel right in front of us and itâ€™s really around execution for us this year",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So clearly, benefit from cloud applications, not only in SubCom, youâ€™ve heard it in D&D, where we have also had that benefit",,,
The hyperscale customers and we are getting benefits in both the segments from them,,,
Sure,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Well, a couple of different angles there",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We did inch up the restructuring comments from 90 days ago and largely there is not one item on there that drives it,,,
"There is a list of several things, particularly around some footprint consolidation that continues to go on, or deals for acquisitions that have been completed over the last few years",acquisitions,,
"And marginally, thatâ€™s facility consolidation","sales,earnings",,
"And then there are some structural things that we look at and we will continue to be ongoing, Iâ€™d say for this year and probably into the early part of next year, just in terms of how organized and the layers within the company",,,
"So more to come on that, but I think we are sharpening our pencils certainly",,,Uncertain
Not all $150 million of that restructuring would be cash charges,,,
There is some things in there that are non-cash that we will talk about later in the year,,,
"So, more to come on that, but in the M&A side, certainly we are active",acquisitions,,
Intercontec has been a great performance out of the gate,,Positive,Confident
"We are also very pleased with the performance on the medical side, Creganna â€“ well, both of those are well ahead of the deal model expectations and are executed very well",,,
"And Creganna, we will anniversary here little bit late this quarter, in terms of the fresh full year on our portfolio",,,
The Medical space has continued to have legs to it,,,
"And so looking at things along that, maybe not the same size necessarily of ground type transaction, those things are a little bit closer to the Intercontec size or something, plus or minus in that range that have good margins and where we can get to a return on invested capital may be a little quicker than historically we have, so lots of opportunity out there, but we will be choosy and spend the shareholdersâ€™ dollar wisely","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
"A couple of things, well, thanks for the question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Our expectations around sensors has not changed for the New Year,,,
"Overall, we expect growth to be mid single-digit",sales,Positive,Confident
"The only change we would have to be due to FX, so our expectation has not changed versus where we were",,,
"I think when you look at it, certainly, we did get impacted in our sensors business by the same thing that impacted our industrial business since we bought Measurement",,,Uncertain
And Measurement was very much focused on industrial applications,,,
"So as there was the industrial recession going on that impacted our Industrial segment, it did also impact the Measurement asset, then the growth was a little bit slower",sales,Positive,Confident
"What we really get excited about was when we bought Measurement, we basically signed up to scale that and use our go-to-market and take that great Measurement technology into different markets like automotive and to places like industrial transportation",,Positive,Confident
"And really, those program wins and that momentum there is very strong, that program pipeline is strong",,Positive,Confident
"But as you know, those programs donâ€™t â€“ one of the day and ship them in three months, they are programs that we have been building out past couple of years",,,
"And really you are going to see the growth of that, really in 2018 as when we are going to start having some of our launches",sales,Positive,Confident
Thatâ€™s why we are investing ahead in sensors and part of those programs,,,
"And in some cases, that they are integrated products",products_services,,
"They are not just the sensor element, they are things that also have additional things on them",,,
So we feel very good that we are leveraging our go-to-market to get those wins,,,Uncertain
"Certainly, you are not seeing them in the numbers yet",,,
"And 2018 is when you are going to start to see those come through with revenue and going to be excited to show it to you in â€™18 and shows you normalcy in 2017, is not just where the program ramps are",sales,,
They are a big chunk order in automotive and they are among many technologies,,,
"So there you amended either temperature, the pressure, they are among many different technologies and in the sensor space the fragmentation around the sensor space, really make to that, you compete against different people not one competitor",,,
"So whatâ€™s really great about the programs we have won is they are among varying technologies, they are at different regions of the world, which really shows the strength of our go-to-market and then it also comes out some of that business case that when we bought Measurement to get these technologies, how do we leverage our go-to-market in places where we have very exceptional leadership positions like our Transportation segment, we are leveraging",organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
"So we will continue to share those as they ramp, but 2018 will be the year where you will start seeing it in the numbers versus just from our works",,,
"When you look at it Mark, similar to last quarter, we knew there is this China incentives that was ending at the end of the first quarter",,,
We expected a slide in China demand that the incentive is sort of phased out throughout the year,,,
"We do expect production to still stay strong into the second quarter, but there is still is an element of when you have incentives, this is pull forward demand",products_services,Positive,Confident
"And so when we look at it and talking to our customers, they have told us things back to production to moderate in the second half versus a very strong level we are going to have in the first quarter and continue a little bit in the second quarter",products_services,Positive,Confident
"So itâ€™s not really different that while we pull forward, just we are getting a little bit decreased production due to the incentive being phased out",products_services,,
"So when we look at the second half, the second half is identical to where we were 90 days ago and if there is more incentives around China, I would expect we would benefit from it, but they are not there yet",,,
And we are really aligned with our customers,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So like we said, we expect auto production in our third and fourth quarter to be relatively flat, globally",products_services,,

"Tom, do you want to start with that and I will jump in then?",,,
"Now, when you look at it clearly, we view that as an opportunity",,,
"When you get into any integration and one of the things thatâ€™s great about the business that we have always had is we benefit from electronics trends, but we also get integrated out due to electronic trends",,Positive,Confident
"Connectors can be integrated out by semiconductors and so forth, but because there are more electronics happening, it also creates in that content opportunity",,,
"I think when we look at it Steve, itâ€™s really around it creates more opportunity because of the abilities we have and the value we provide to our customers",,,Uncertain
"So why as we said there itâ€™s why we get excited about our content in auto being able to grow from the 60 to 80 that we talked about, because what sensors brings to it, how we integrate these things in, I mean we probably arenâ€™t to a turnkey level, but you describe how I think about it, but that integration we provide to allow some way to get to a turnkey level is very important",,,Uncertain
And that drives the content growth opportunity and the stickiness we have with our customers and our engineers basically create so much more opportunities,sales,Positive,Confident
So we knew thatâ€™s a net-net opportunity,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We donâ€™t view its displacement, because we are very close to the architecture of the vehicle and what we do",,,

"The world that we play in partnering with BOEs and the Tier 1s, both of them are our customers is really what we get excited about why I am so buoyant on the content opportunity",,,
So itâ€™s all plus,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"I think when you look at it, I think you can always think that we have always a priority towards the components side, but even when you do take Creganna, that is doing more than just a component",,,Uncertain
So I think you will see things over time of that can add integration like skills,,,Uncertain
But I think it will be a balance of both and it will be how does it tie into our strategies in different markets,,,Uncertain
"I think you have seen move into that with Creganna, but we had more the component they had much more a full assembly and integration capability that we had and thatâ€™s one of the things we get excited about the close of our customers and medical wanted that",,,Uncertain

"We delivered 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, which is up 15% over the prior year","sales,earnings",,
This year's growth in EPS year-over-year was entirely driven by our sales and operating income performance,sales,Positive,Confident
If you want to look at our $1.24 compared to our guidance of $1.16 approximately half was driven by the higher sales growth of 8% with the remainder driven by taxes and a little bit of currency,sales,Positive,Confident

"In auto, our sales were up 6% organically with mid-single-digit growth rate in the Americas, Europe and Asia against a global auto production growth of only 1%","products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
We continue to consistently demonstrate the ability to outperform the market due to content growth and expect that trend to continue even at these lower production levels,products_services,Positive,Confident
We also expect the benefit from new program ramps as we go forward which will also continue the outperformance due to content versus market,,,
"For the full year of 2017, we expect high-single-digit organic growth in auto on approximately 3% production growth, but clearly that 3% production growth was driven by the stronger production growth in the first half that we talked about in prior calls","products_services,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Turning to commercial transportation, our business continues to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 23% year-over-year","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Growth is driven by continued strength in the global heavy-duty truck market, particularly in China, and while we do expect China growth will moderate over time, we are encouraged to see signs of continued growth in Europe and North America as these markets improve",sales,Positive,Confident

"Additionally, we're also encouraged by the strong design win momentum that we had in sensors that was reflected by double-digit order growth year-over-year in the quarter",sales,Positive,Confident
"Adjusted operating margin were as expected at approximately 19% in the quarter in the segment, but I would say, at these year-over-year revenue growth levels, we would normally expect a corresponding expansion of margins versus where we guided","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"However, demand in the second half of this year has exceeded our expectations, and has led to some near-term inefficiencies in our supply chain as we make sure we satisfy our customers",,,
"This is a temporary issue as our teams are fully engaged to ensure our customers are not impacted by these supply dynamics, and we expect this to be fully remedied in early fiscal 2018. So let's talk about the Industrial Solutions segment, so I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 6. Growth momentum in the Industrial Solutions segment continued with 5% organic growth year-over-year in the quarter","sales,organic_expansion",Negative,Uncertain
Segment sales did exceed our expectations due to strength in industrial equipment with this business growing 10% organically,organic_expansion,,
"Now, this growth we saw in the industrial equipment side is really due to our position in the factory automation and medical markets, also coupled with the acquisitions that we completed last year, and this is really driving the strong growth ahead of the market on both a reported and on an organic basis","sales,organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"When you think about Intercontec and Creganna, both of these acquisitions performing exceptionally well and ahead of our expectations",acquisitions,Neutral,Uncertain
"In aerospace, defense and marine, we did see a slight organic decline in the quarter in revenue, and this was driven entirely by program timing in commercial aerospace, and that was partially offset by growth in defense","sales,organic_expansion",Negative,NIL
"Our energy business in the quarter grew 2% organically, and that was driven by growth in Europe and Asia","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"On the margin side, our adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 12.7%, and this was flat sequentially and down year-over-year due to the near term softness in commercial aerospace, which does run above segment average margins","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL

The Communications segment delivered another outstanding quarter with 14% organic growth and 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 16%,"sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
Performance was well ahead of the market and included contributions from all three of the businesses,,,
Starting with data and devices,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Data and devices had 6% organic growth as we continued to benefit from high-speed ramps in cloud infrastructure customers,"sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident

"Earlier this month, we announced the winning of a new regional program which provides high-speed bandwidth between the Caribbean and the United States, and we continue to expect high-single-digit growth for the SubCom business in 2017. Now, with that as a backdrop, I'll hand it over to Heath who'll get into the financials in more detail",sales,Positive,Confident
"And let me get into guidance, and I'll start with the fourth quarter",,,
"And if you could turn to slide 10, please, I'd appreciate it",,,
"For the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter revenue at $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.16. When you look at this, this represents reported sales growth of 5% and organic sales growth of 4%","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"And from an operational perspective, this would be adjusted EPS growth of 8% once you normalize with the unusually low tax rate we had last year that Heath just highlighted",sales,Positive,Confident
Looking at it by segment,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"For the fourth quarter, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single digits on both a reported and on an organic basis",organic_expansion,,
This is above expected auto production levels of 1% with the outperformance driven by the content growth I mentioned earlier,products_services,Positive,Confident
"We also expect growth in commercial transportation across all regions in the fourth quarter, and as noted earlier, we do expect to have some lingering effects on margins from supply chain dynamics in the fourth quarter","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"But expect margin performance to improve as we put these issues behind us in early 2018. In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow high single digits on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically, with growth expected across all three of our business units","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"And we also expect, as I mentioned, operating margins to expand sequentially as well as year-over-year in the fourth quarter","sales,earnings",,
"And in Communications, we expect also mid-single-digit growth on both the reported and organic basis with growth in each of our three businesses","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"And while we're not providing guidance beyond this fiscal year, I would ask that as you look at your models, you keep in mind our typical seasonal trends as you think about next year",,,Uncertain
"And while demand continues to be strong, we historically see seasonal declines in the mid-single-digit range from quarter four into our first quarter",,Positive,Confident
"I'd also ask as you think about adjusted operating margins, please keep in mind that we're currently running in the mid-16% range, and that the first quarter 2017 had an unusually high operating margin level that we covered in detail back in the first quarter call","sales,earnings",Positive,Uncertain
"Now, let's turn to slide 11, so I can cover full guidance or ramp up and then go to Q&A",,,
We are raising the midpoint of our guidance to represent 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for 2017. We expect revenue in the range of $12.85 billion to $12.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 to $4.74. I'm very proud that our 20% EPS growth is driven almost entirely by strong organic growth performance and operating income expansion that we have in 2017. We did also benefit from using our strong cash flow model both via adding on bolt-on M&A and returning capital to our owners,"sales,earnings,organic_expansion,acquisitions",Positive,Confident
"When you think about the growth in the margin and the EPS by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to be up high-single digits organically on approximately 3% global auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains","sales,earnings,products_services,organic_expansion",Neutral,Uncertain
"Commercial transportation, we'd expect it to outperform its end market benefiting from both content expansion and share gain in heavy trucks, and we continue to expect sensors to grow mid-single digits year-over-year, as I previously mentioned",organic_expansion,,
"In Industrial Solutions for the year, organic growth guidance of low-single digits is consistent with the guidance we've been giving since the start of the year, reflecting continued improvement in industrial markets","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"And in Communications, we expect it to be up high-single digits organically, a further improvement versus our prior view, reflecting continued strength in our appliances and growth in data and devices","sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
Our guidance relating to SubCom is being maintained that we're going to grow high-single digits in that business,,,
"In summary, I feel very good about our portfolio and execution and believe we are well-positioned to deliver growth ahead of our markets",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"As Heath mentioned, we've established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, and this year's results represent best-in-class performance with 7% organic growth, expanded operating margins and 20% adjusted EPS growth that these results truly demonstrate the execution along all the levers we have in our business model","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident
"Lastly, before I go to Q&A, I want to close by thanking our employees all around the world for their continued strong execution and commitment to our customers",,Positive,Confident
"So, with that, Sujal, let's open it up for questions",,,
"Thank you, Wamsi, for the question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"But let me take it because it is something what we think about our Transportation business model, first it always starts with a global picture",,,Uncertain
And I think one of the things that we're very fortunate about where we drive growth it's just not in one region in the world it's across the world,sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And even as production has slowed down to 1% and pretty much in line with where we are, it does come back to how do we drive across the three big trends that are happening in the vehicle",products_services,Negative,NIL
"And we've continuously shown content growth, and it has been accelerating both from our focus as you think about not only what's happening in the connected car or in safety applications, but also benefiting from everything that happens around the powertrain whether it's on combustion engine that needs to get more fuel efficient towards the adoption of electric vehicles that while we talk electric vehicles and you really think about it, we get very excited around where electric vehicles are going in China",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"So it is along all three dimensions both with where safety applications go, certainly the emission and the green go and also around the connected",,,
"And what we feel very proud of if you went back five years ago, our content per vehicle in a car was around $50. Today, it's well over $60, and we with the programs that we are winning, we see that content momentum continuing to increase",,,Uncertain
"And when you take the results that we have in a 1% production environment, like we've had in quarter three as well as what we expect really in quarter four, growing mid-single-digit shows the content momentum we have",products_services,,
And I just think we continue to demonstrate it and we feel very good about the program ramps will continue to allow us to have that type of separation even as global production stays at a low-single-digit to flat environment that we're in,products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Thank you, Wamsi",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Yeah,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
So let me talk about EV,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And I always do think, Shawn, it's important to make sure when you talk EV about â€“ close to 90 million cars are made in the world, and today, there's about 4 million that are electric vehicles whether it's pure electric or plug-in hybrid, et cetera",,,Uncertain
"So, what's really â€“ what we like about that is you do have your emission regulation to drive that increase, but when you sit there, we see the opportunity to that type of level to quadruple of the amount of electric type vehicles over the next five years",,,
"And when you see that, clearly, that creates higher demand for power and voltage connections that also gets into things we do from our very high-current relay-type products, as well as you get into sensing that occurs there",products_services,,
"And when you sit there, that really comes down to the energy management that gets into the harsh environment",,,
So the whole environment that you have there really plays to our strength of our engineers and how we have to work with our customers to really make this volume grow,,,
"When you think about from a content, on a traditional combustion engine, due to the trends I just talked about, what occurs on that combustion on a model, we typically get about 1.5 multiple of content to a hybrid and then about 2x content increase on a pure electric",,,Uncertain
"So if something has $60 today of content on a vehicle, an opportunity to get closer to $100 on a hybrid and you could go up to basically $120 on a full electric is the simplest way to think about it",,,Uncertain
"So that's the excitement we have around the content growth, and that comes into the emissions",sales,Positive,Confident
"So we think we're very well-positioned, we think we're positioned globally in all regions of the world around the players in that market and it is part of our content growth story of how we position ourselves and it's investments we've been making","sales,organic_expansion,competition",Neutral,Uncertain
"I would guess it's a fair question, but really what it is, is what we're seeing is in certain parts of the supply chain, you see this in some areas and so forth as lead times have expanded, we've seen some customer behavior place orders now that are a little bit more extended",,,
"So when we typically think about our orders, our orders are typically pretty current",,,Uncertain
We typically have orders that are for the current quarter or further out,,,
"We've seen some extended placement out, it is not that we're under shipping demand it's just that I would say people are making sure their supply chains are lined up for as they are doing production because they've been surprised in certain categories",products_services,,
"So it's why when we look at our double-digit order growth, our guidance is more mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter because we see orders placed out to the far first fiscal quarter and into second fiscal quarter",sales,Positive,Confident
I don't see them being cancelled,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I just think there will be things that will smooth out over time,,,Uncertain
"I would say when you take our lead times, collectively, yes, they're pretty normal",,,
"There are some pockets, like Heath talked about on his automotive question, as well as some of our businesses where you see 14% and 20% growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"They've extended a certain product category, but it's very pocketed, not broad based",products_services,,
"I think it's pretty pure actually, Amit",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So when you sit there, I think it's pretty pure",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Things getting extended, I would not say",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The automotive supply chain stays pretty tight, and that's why we have some of the extra cost to make sure we do not disappoint our customers",op_costs,,
"But in auto itself, I would say, when you look at the growth we've had, it doesn't pull in meaningfully or push out meaningfully because that's why we've had the extra cost","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"Sure, Craig",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Let me take that, and I think when you think about North America automotive, I want to take a step back and frame global automotive first",,,Uncertain
"We have to realize there's 90 million cars, plus or minus, made on the planet and 17 million of those cars are made in the United States",,,
"So I do think we have to remember, 50 million of the cars made in the planet are in Asia, and well in the mid-20s are made in Europe",,,Uncertain
"So North America while we live in every day as Americans, it is the minor part of production when you think about it globally",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Our automotive business in North America, and we look at this year, like I said, we have about mid-single-digit growth here in the quarter",sales,Positive,Confident
So we have the same content trends but the size or sensitivity is only about $800 million of total TE,,,
"So, it's only about 6%",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"And even as you said North America automotive production went down 5%, and we decline with it, it would be $40 million of revenue and a couple of pennies","sales,products_services",Negative,NIL
"So, I think about it, I think it gets a little bit too much press when you think about TE versus our great global position we have in automotive",,Positive,Uncertain
"And if we correct it by 5% production, it will be couple of cents in the big picture",products_services,,
"So, certainly we won't want to see that, but it won't be a big thing in the big picture of TE",,,
"On sensors, your second question, when we sit there our turf momentum that we talked to you about in many quarters is continuing",,,
"And what we really appreciate is that the programs that we're winning across the sensor portfolio that we got with mesh (39:40) the wins we're getting with our customers are across humidity, pressure, force, position, et cetera",,,
"So what's really great is across the whole product set, which is what we were excited about, and it's also across all regions of the world",products_services,Positive,Confident
It's not concentrated,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

So that's always a plus and I feel very good how our team been executing organic wins with those important customers,organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"When you think about it, this year we're going to be a little bit below $1 billion, and I think as you look into next year, I think our fair assumption is sort of keep that flattish because we do get to a level of capacity constraints as well as have orders that are coming in and the routes we're building",,,Uncertain
"I think as we sit there, some of the things that we continue to think through is what are the next routes to those customer needs, how do we schedule that",,,Uncertain
"So, it does not feel to us that you would have the trough cycle we've had in the past when you had customer dry up or customers be impacted by financing cycle because these customers do have capital and do not need capital markets",,,Uncertain
"So we're still in the middle of what trough is, but it still feels like a business that the trough is much higher",,,
"I think it begun probably in the $700 million to $1 billion range, is what we've been telling people, but I would say we're still trying to figure that out",,,Uncertain
"Matt, you're exactly right",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, let me take it from what we're seeing through our channel partners because when you go outside of Transportation and you're into our Communications segment excluding SubCom as well as our Industrial segment, you do have about 40%, 50% of those businesses go through distribution",,,
So I think that's the right way,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's just the latter part is how you asked it,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"What we're seeing, we're seeing right now through our channel partners, they're having point-of-sale out that's pretty much high-single digit and their inventory has been very flat",,,
So we don't see inventory building up in the channel and staying very consistent with where it's been,,,
"So, we don't see creep up there",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
And the order rates that we're having from our channel partners were pretty similar to our company average in a low-double digit,,,
"So, the dynamics we're seeing through distribution, I would say, are consistent overall",,,
We're not seeing inventory getting ahead of itself,,,
"And I would just say when we look at those markets from a direct customer where we service the larger customers direct, it does feel like it's demand",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"I mean, we're seeing improving markets globally, and what we're seeing and how we're seeing it is these are due to production increases by our customers where we deal with customers directly and not through our channel partners",products_services,,
"We'll guide, Matt, when we get to our first quarter call",,,
"So, I just think some observations I would make as we exit there",,,Uncertain
"I talked about, certainly, I think with what we're seeing, we would expect a seasonal coming out of the quarter four and the quarter one",,,Uncertain
"I think when you take the bigger picture, and I think about next year, number one is the content growth story we have in automotive, I think, is very evident of the traction we have",sales,Neutral,Uncertain
"And I think it's fair to assume that automotives, being in this flat to plus 1% production environment where we are right now, would continue into next year",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
And I think we've been very clear that we think we can grow mid-single digit in it,,,Uncertain
"I think when you get into the industrial markets, I see them improving",,,Uncertain

The biggest piece is the efforts we've done over the last three years to get that business focused on high speed and move away from the consumer device base primarily,,,
"So when you look at the big growth, it's really the culmination of the cost actions as well as the focus of the portfolio that we did in that segment mainly around D&D","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident

SubCom had a very strong organic growth of 22%,"sales,organic_expansion",Positive,Confident

"I think longer term you should think about the segment margins staying around mid teens, depending upon where the businesses are, but that's where I think you can think about it, but a lot of that margin improvement was structural impact that we've been driving over the past three years that we've talked to you all about","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
No,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continues,,,
Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year-ago,,,
I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments,,,

"Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago","sales,earnings",,
"We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand",products_services,,
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders,products_services,,
"In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases",,,
"Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter",sales,Positive,Confident

"Yes, it included several agreements with the several different cross licensees, but the part of that was a sale of some IP assets, and that was recognized and restructuring other lines",,,
And then the balance was settlement of past infringement that was recognized in the other income expense model,op_costs,,

"Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance",,,
"Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation",,,
Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter,,,
"Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days",,,
Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter,,,
"On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago",,,
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue,sales,,
"As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue",sales,,
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue,sales,,
Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model,,,
"As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners",products_services,Positive,Confident
"In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion",,,
Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion,,,
These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners,,,
"Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count",,,

"In March, we retired $250 million of debt",debt,,
This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%,debt,,
Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash,,,
"We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S",organic_expansion,,
entities owning about 80% of our cash,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses,,,
"Turning to our outlook for second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit","sales,earnings",,
"Before moving to Q&A, there are three changes that I want to explain to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook",,,
"The first is to remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new GAAP standard that impacts the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation",,,
"While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our effective tax rate and earnings per share",earnings,,
"To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impact",,,
We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance just as we did this quarter,,,
"To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance",,,
This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer term models,,,
"Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017 respectively",,,
"Therefore, the effective tax rates which include discrete tax items translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively",,,
These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models,,,
"If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year",,,
"I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter to quarter, particularly in first quarter",,,
We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete tax items as well as the retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti,,,
com/ir,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
Hopefully providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard,,,
"The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue","sales,op_costs",,
"This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue","sales,op_costs",,
A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties,,,
We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue,sales,,
"Instead, they will be recorded as income in other income and expense",op_costs,,
"As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue",sales,,
"They were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago",,,
We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future,,,
"However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as other income and expense rather than in revenue as of our first quarter 2017 results","sales,op_costs",,
"I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages",,,
We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress,,,

I'll handle that one,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"On OpEx, everything came in about as expected",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL

And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years,,,
"And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that",,,
"So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines",,,Uncertain
"If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level first to second, I would remind you that second quarter does have three months of higher pay and benefit raises versus only two months in first quarter",,,Uncertain

"Yes, we are â€“ well, I'll answer our inventory days and then I'll let Dave comment on the disti channel",,,
But we're comfortable with our inventory days,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's well within our range,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth",sales,Positive,Confident
"And the other key point to remember is as we have focused our strategy more on industrial, automotive and on catalog type of parts, the risk of obsolescence on this part is really minimal",op_risks,,
So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth,sales,Positive,Confident
"Yes, I'd be happy to comment",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The update is no change,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
It's the same strategy for M&A,acquisitions,,
"We looked at â€“ we're always considering options and looking at things, but it has to be an opportunity that is focused on industrial, it's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog",,,
So it has to be a good strategic fit from that standpoint,,,
But then the other component that has to be there is that the numbers have to make sense,,,
"So when we have both of those combinations, then we are willing to move forward on considering that further",,,
"So the change in royalties was included in our guidance, meaning that the royalties were in other income and expense, just like how they came in in results",op_costs,,
"And on a go-forward basis, they will stay in other income and expense",op_costs,,
"So for modeling purposes, you can look at how that other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to that on a go-forward basis",op_costs,,
"Yes, sure",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth","sales,earnings",Neutral,Uncertain
And that's what we're focused on industrial and automotive,,,
Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces,sales,Positive,Confident
"Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter",sales,Positive,Confident
"As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage, and that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less",op_costs,,
"In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter",,,
"So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin but more importantly, higher free cash flow, And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company","sales,earnings",,
"Well, I'll give you some color and then I'll let Dave chime in",,,
"But, we think of our strategy, as stated in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand",,,Uncertain
And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
This capacity we can buy,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow",op_costs,Positive,Confident
"So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions",,,Uncertain
"The way I would comment on that is, we have said before that our revenues fall through between 70% and 75%",sales,,
"So if you do that math on a sequential basis, you'll get somewhere close to where you need to be",,,
Let me address the second part of that question first,,,
"That's clear, we've been focusing on industrial and on automotive",,,
"That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets",organic_expansion,Positive,Confident
"Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive, so those investments are paying off","sales,acquisitions",,
"On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comments",,,
"We like, our stated goal or model is 20% to 30% OpEx",,,
"I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti",organic_expansion,Neutral,Uncertain
"com, and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages",,,
"So OpEx 20% to 30% in stable times, in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 months",,,
So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx,,,Uncertain

"Before diving into quarter one results, I want to highlight a few changes we've made to our reporting beginning in 2017. As we previewed last quarter, post the spinoff of Conduent, we have streamlined the management of the business along geographic sales channels and, therefore, now have one reportable segment",,,
We are at the same time enhancing our disclosures to provide additional insight on our results,,,
"Around revenue, we are providing additional details by geographic sales channel, by product grouping for equipment sales revenue, and will continue to provide line-of-sight to our document outsourcing, or what we now call Manage Document Services revenues, as well as progress on the shift over time of our revenues toward our strategic growth areas","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
"On profitability, we'll be providing gross margins for both equipment and post sale revenues","sales,earnings",,
"On cash flow, we're providing some commentary around our expectations for normalized operating cash flow after we get past near-term higher restructuring payments and pension contributions",,,
We believe these reporting changes will give greater context to our results and perspective of our business model,,,
I'll talk more about them as we go through the presentation,,,
"With that, let's start with the review of the income statement, which I'm going to mainly talk to on an adjusted basis that excludes non-service retirement-related costs, restructuring and related costs, and amortization of intangible assets",op_costs,,
"In addition, this quarter, we had two other discrete items that we adjusted for, and that essentially offset, a $13 million charge related to the extinguishment of debt and a $16 million benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter related to a previously-adjusted item",debt,,
"revenue, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide, was down $161 million, or 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency, which is consistent with full-year 2016. Looking at the cost ratios, savings from our strategic transformation program more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction-currency impact of 110 basis points, resulting in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points and an improvement in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 20 basis points","sales,earnings,op_costs",Negative,NIL
"Within our definition of operating income is equity income, which was down year-over-year due to the Fuji Xerox receivable write-off that Jeff mentioned",,,
"As Fujifilm recently announced, they are reviewing the appropriateness of accounting practices related to certain sales of leasing transactions involving Fuji Xerox New Zealand",,,
"Our first quarter results included charge of approximately $30 million within equity income, representing our share of the current Fujifilm estimated adjustment for this review",,,
"Although the approximate $0.03 impact of the Fuji Xerox New Zealand receivable matter is included in our adjusted EPS, we are modifying our definition of adjusted operating margin to exclude this matter in order to present a more normalized view","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
"On this basis, overall adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points and adjusted operating profit was up $6 million","sales,earnings",,
"So, from an operating perspective, overall good cost management offset revenue declines consistent with our expectations","sales,op_costs",Negative,NIL
"Turning to the below-the-line items, other expenses net of $41 million was $4 million better year-over-year as lower interest expense roughly offset the gain on sales of assets in the prior year",op_costs,,
"The tax rate of 27.5% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28%, and was higher by 6.1 points year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.01 impact year-over-year to adjusted EPS",,,
"Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.15 was down $0.03 from Q1 2016 driven by the higher tax rate and the Fuji Xerox matter",,,
GAAP EPS was $0.02 in the quarter,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets, as well as the two discrete items I described earlier",op_costs,,
"Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue",sales,Negative,NIL
"Starting with total revenue, from a geographic perspective, North America was down 4.5%, or 4.8% in constant currency, and represented 60% of our revenues",sales,Negative,NIL
"International represented 35% of total revenue, and reflected higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we saw a turn there and overall improvement off a weak Q1 2016. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, which includes our OEM business, sales of Fuji Xerox and licensing",sales,Negative,NIL
"Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 7.4%, or 5.7% in constant currency",sales,Negative,NIL
"From a product-offering perspective, entry equipment sales was down 6.4%, or 5.5% in constant currency, an improvement in trend reflecting the rebound in developing markets, as well as early benefits from new products offset by continued higher OEM equipment declines",products_services,Negative,NIL
"Mid-range was down 8.6%, or 7% in constant currency, so relatively weaker, but anticipated given that none of our recently-announced new mid-range workplace products were available in quarter one",products_services,Negative,NIL
"Lastly, we saw better performance in high-end equipment sales, which were down 6.1%, or 3.7% in constant currency, an improvement from the fourth quarter",,,
A couple of points to highlight in the high-end,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"First, color equipment grew 1% in constant currency; and, second, the growth was driven by the higher end of the portfolio, continuous feed and iGen products",products_services,Positive,Confident
"Entry production color products were down year-over-year, as we have yet to benefit from the new Versant products we only just announced",products_services,Negative,NIL
Post sale revenue was down 5.8% or 3.9% in constant currency,sales,Negative,NIL
"This compares to a decline of 2.9% in 2016. The higher Q1 post sale decline was driven by Managed Document Services, which essentially is our previously reported document outsourcing revenues now expanded to include Managed Print Services within Global Imaging","sales,products_services",Negative,NIL
"In Q1, Managed Document Services was 33% of our revenues","sales,products_services",,
It was down 2% in actual currency and up 0.4% in constant currency,,,
"This compares to 2.6% constant currency growth in 2016. The slowdown can be attributed to lower signings in recent quarters within the enterprise space, as well as a challenging compare in Q1 as Q1 2016 Managed Document Services was up 4.9% in constant currency driven by strong equipment growth",products_services,Negative,NIL
"I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a view which I have already touched on",,,
"Strategic growth areas in the first quarter grew 1% in constant currency and comprised 39% of our total revenues, a 2 point mix shift from the year ago period",sales,Positive,Confident
The growth of 1% did not reflect benefits from our newly launched products and compares to growth of 2% in 2016 with the trend change coming from the Managed Document Services component I just discussed,products_services,Positive,Confident
Jeff highlighted earlier that we made progress in Q1 laying the foundation to drive improvement in strategic growth areas with a target to shift the mix by approximately 3 points this year,sales,Positive,Confident
"Turning to installs, as expected, color was stronger than black and white",,Positive,Confident
"We saw improved performance in entry, although a weaker mix given the better developing markets performance where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio",sales,,
Mid-range installs likewise were dampened as expected by not benefiting yet from the newly launched products,products_services,,
"And high-end installs were weaker than equipment revenue performance I described earlier as mix improved the stronger performance in the higher-end products like continuous feed and iGen, offsetting install declines in entry production products given product launch timing","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
Signings in the quarter of $532 million were down 6% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency,,,
"With that, we did see improvement in new business signings which were up 1% year-over-year at constant currency",,,
"Signings, as Jeff mentioned, is an area where we are making investments in sales coverage and taking action to drive better results",organic_expansion,,
I should note that we only have a line of sight to signings in the lower growth large enterprise areas,sales,Positive,Confident
"So broadly speaking, total Managed Document Services revenue growth outperformed signings as the higher market growth is coming from the SMB area","sales,products_services",Positive,Confident
The last key measurement I'd like to cover is strategic transformation,,,
This is a critical program to drive both expanding margins and enabling investments to improve revenue trajectory,"sales,earnings,organic_expansion",,
"We have many projects underway spanning the company and we continue to target $600 million in gross savings for 2017. We took, as anticipated, a fairly large restructuring charge of $120 million in quarter one to position us to achieve our full year gross savings objectives",,,
"There are headwinds related to revenue declines as well as currency that partially offset these savings, but net-net we anticipate continued margin expansion for the full year","sales,earnings",Negative,NIL
"Before moving on to cash flow, I'd like to take some time to cover the trends we're sitting at a high level and how we expect them to play out as we progress through the year",,,
The total revenue decline of 4.3% in constant currency was consistent with 2016 and an improvement over Q4. We continue to expect full year constant currency revenue declines in the mid-single digits with about 2 points of negative translation currency,sales,Negative,NIL
"From a calendarization perspective, Q2 will face the most challenging year-over-year compare and we won't see a full quarter's benefit from the new product launch",products_services,Negative,Uncertain
"So net-net, we'd expect higher declines in Q2 with moderating declines in the second half driven by improving equipment revenue trends",sales,Negative,NIL
Operating margin is seasonally weakest in Q1 so we expect improvement in absolute terms as we move through the year supported by our continued focus on our transformation and productivity initiatives,"sales,earnings,products_services",,
"Transaction currency is dampening some of that improvement and was a negative 110-basis-point year-over-year impact to margin in Q1. At current rates, we expect a slightly higher negative impact in Q2 and more moderate impacts in the second half","sales,earnings",,
"Lastly, and looking at the trends for adjusted EPS, we are continuing to guide for full year adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.88, which compares to $0.88 in 2016. The drivers of full year 2017 adjusted EPS as we highlighted last quarter are currency and the higher tax rate partially offset by lower interest expense",op_costs,,
"These factors impacted our first quarter results and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through",products_services,Negative,Dodgy
I will now shift to discuss cash flow,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Operating cash flow generation coming from continuing operations in the quarter was $190 million, up $103 million year-over-year and free cash flow was $164 million, up $109 million year-over-year",,,
So a good result driven in part by working capital timing as inventories were a smaller use year-over-year given product launch timing and payables were also a source,products_services,Positive,Confident
"As we indicated last quarter, our operating cash flow guidance of $700 million to $900 million will be about $200 million lower this year than normalized operating cash flow of about $1 billion driven by higher restructuring payments and pension contributions",,,
"Q1 operating cash flow reflected the higher restructuring payment expectations, $60 million versus $21 million in the prior year",,,
The pension contributions of $23 million were only a small portion of our guidance of $350 million for the full year,,,
Investing cash flows were a use of $35 million and included CapEx spend of $26 million and $11 million related to a small GIS acquisition,"organic_expansion,acquisitions",,
"Cash used in financing was over $1 billion and reflected $1.3 billion in senior note repayments and $87 million in dividends, both common and preferred",,,
Turning now to the capital structure slide I will spend a few minutes on debt before handing it back to Jeff,debt,,
"We ended Q1 with $5 billion of debt, which is lower than 2016 ending debt of $6.3 billion reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments I just highlighted",debt,,
Two elements made up the repayments,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
The first was the repayment of $1 billion associated with two senior notes that matured,,,
"In addition, in the quarter we exchanged $600 million of certain senior notes due 2018 through 2020 for $300 million in cash and $300 million in new senior notes due 2022 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.07%",,,
This transaction in essence allowed us to early retire $300 million in debt and extend out the term of an additional $300 million,debt,,
"Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.7 billion is allocated to financing debt calculated by a fine of 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $472 million of equipment on operating leases",debt,,
This financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage,debt,,
"So, to summarize, overall a positive start to the year with most operational metrics in line with expectations, putting us on track to meet our full-year guidance",,,
"With that, I will hand it back to Jeff",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Hi, Shannon",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
This is Bill Osbourn,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
I'll touch on that,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that â€“ both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion",earnings,Neutral,Uncertain
And the two primary items which you mentioned are the higher pension contributions over that period of time being approximately $100 million-plus higher each given year,,,
"And then also, we were going to have higher restructuring payments each of those two years as we were doing our strategic transformation",,,
We would expect those to normalize and have a $200 million-plus benefit versus to get to a more normalized $1 billion cash flow in 2019 and beyond,,,
So similar to what we said at year-end both 2017 and 2018 would be dampened by approximately $200 million,,,
"We are working continuously to improve our working capital both from an inventory management perspective, managing receivables, payables, timing, et cetera, and we have some specific projects in place to really focus on inventory management, but the primary things impacting the normalized cash flow are the higher restructuring payments this year and next year, and the higher pension contributions",,,
"As far as your second part of your question regarding the uses of cash, similar thoughts to year-end",,,
"Given the $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow we're expecting this year, and our cash on hand on the balance sheet at the end of the year, we projected to have about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash available",,,
"We're going to pay down incremental $300 million of debt, which we did during the quarter; dividends around $280 million, CapEx we're guiding about $175 million and M&A in the $100 million range","organic_expansion,acquisitions,debt",Negative,NIL
"That left, if you're doing the math, about $100 million to $300 million that we're evaluating the best uses of, whether that's paying down additional debt, whether M&A opportunities come along, et cetera","acquisitions,debt",Negative,NIL
"At this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet",sales,Positive,Confident
"Just to follow-on, I was going to say the same thing",,,
"G&A, clearly, we're looking for areas to cut costs, where we are not going to be impacting future revenue growth, and G&A is one of those areas","sales,op_costs",Positive,Confident
"We've done benchmark analyses and have identified areas that we plan on reducing costs in certain G&A sectors, and that will be clearly an area of focus",op_costs,,
"There are â€“ the reinvestment, clearly is â€“ part of it is offsetting various headwinds from currency transactions, et cetera, but we are also utilizing these savings to reinvest in the business",organic_expansion,,
"Couple examples would be in â€“ people may not think about it this way, but we are planning on and have been selling more A4s as part of our new product launch, and those have lower margins upfront","sales,earnings,products_services",Neutral,Uncertain
"It's really investing in the business, because you get higher margins over the life of the product due to the post sale revenues, but it is actually an investment getting those machines in field, or MIP, out there, and our goal is to â€“ this year to increase our volume of A4s of our new product launch","sales,earnings,products_services,organic_expansion",,
That is one example in particular,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We are investing in systems, as Jeff mentioned, the delivery area",,,
There are costs there,op_costs,,

"Hey, great question",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"As far as the Fuji Xerox, just to confirm it is a $0.03 impact in our adjusted EPS, so the $0.15 adjusted EPS does include that $0.03 or $30 million charge, or we would have been say it another way, $0.18 without it",,,
"Clearly, we did not know anything when we gave guidance back in January about this charge when we were setting guidance for the full year",,,
"With that said, when you go throughout the year, and we update and we do detailed analyses internally projecting for the rest of the year, there are puts and takes that occur and I'm not going to go through all the details of those but one example of that is we give guidance at the beginning of the year and factor in a certain amount of transaction currency headwinds for the year",,,
"Updated based upon current foreign currency rates, we see that being a couple of pennies less for the rest of the year and that would be something that we factor in to our updated overall guidance analysis",,,
"So the $0.03 clearly was not expected; however, it is factored into the full year updated guidance now and when we look at other puts and takes that come into play as we update each quarter end and we're reaffirming the $0.80 and $0.88 and knowing that that $0.03 charge is in the Q1.",,,
We're not going to go into really details regarding the Fuji Xerox matter other than what they have disclosed,,,
Fujifilm put out a press release last week that specifically cited a Â¥22 billion receivable adjustment,,,
This is our calculated estimate of the impact of that adjustment on our earnings,earnings,,
Fujifilm has stated that they are in the process of an investigation,,,
The Â¥22 billion is their current estimate that they put out there,,,

"Hey, Kulbinder",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"A couple of things really from a difficult compare perspective, we're expecting a little bit bigger headwind in Q2 from a transaction currency perspective",,,
"Also, if you're looking at Q1 last year, we had not fully ramped up our strategic transformation, our restructuring process",,,
By Q2 that had ramped up; it was in full swing,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"So we now have full ramped-up strategic transformation this year in Q2 and in last year in Q2, so that creates a little bit tougher compare",,,
"And we won't fully benefit from all the products being out in Q2. Most of them will be out in Q2, but it won't fully be there yet",products_services,,
"So, with that said, we don't give â€“ we're not giving formal quarterly guidance on adjusted EPS, or anything",,,
"But I think, historically, if you do the math, Q2 has been around 25% of the full year, and it looks to be in that zone for this year",,,Uncertain

"We had anticipated, as stated during Q1 earnings, that Q2 revenues would be the weakest of the year, given product launch timing coupled with Q2 having the most challenging compare","sales,earnings,products_services",Negative,Uncertain
"That played out, driven by equipment revenue declines that were weak, given the significant product transition","sales,products_services",Negative,NIL
Post sale revenue decline of 3.9% in constant currency was in line with the first quarter rates and our expectations,sales,Negative,NIL

In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment","sales,products_services",Negative,NIL

"Within facilities, we are consolidating locations, 79 thus far, with more planned at the balance of the year",,,
"As an example, we moved our headquarters to a smaller location at favorable terms, resulting in a couple million in annual savings",,,
"Within service delivery spend, about 30% of our savings program, we are consolidating our service delivery for MDS and break/fix taxable service under one management umbrella and optimizing our resources",products_services,,
"We are leveraging more remote cell and cell phone technologies, which are further enabled by new generation of product",products_services,,
"This will result in, among other things, greater dispatch efficiency and also enable greater machine uptime leading to better customer satisfaction and more pages printed and more revenue",sales,,
"In supply chain, we're negotiating with vendors for better terms and have outsourced activities",,,
"We've closed five major warehouses and a number of district part centers, which combined will drive around $24 million in annual savings once fully implemented",,,
"Within IT, we are consolidating vendors in areas like mainframe support, moving to shared environments and leveraging more cloud tools to enable greater customer self-service in areas like billing and collection",,,
"And within SG&A, we are advancing our resources to the smaller size of our business following the separation in driving to get some functional spend areas closer to benchmark",op_costs,,
We've reduced spend that layers in a number of areas and we're leveraging more technology to become more efficient in how we get work done,,,
"We're also tackling legacy infrastructure areas like Europe, where historically, it's been more difficult to make changes, to streamline our operations and create more shared services in areas like selling support",products_services,,
"Lastly, our transformation program is not limited to costs",op_costs,,
We're applying the same program diligence to drive better revenue performance,sales,,
Examples of some of these initiatives include using inside sales personnel to call an underpenetrated account and improving pricing tools and resources to give selling hours back to reps and minimize revenue lost on the table,sales,,
"So all in all, a very broad company-wide program with a rigorous process that we work at every day with the goal of not only driving margin expansion, but also in making us more efficient and competitive","sales,earnings",,
"Before covering cash flow, I'll cover the trends we're seeing in how we anticipate they will play out in the back half of the year",,,
"The total revenue decline of 6.4% in constant currency in Q2 was below trend as discussed, driven predominantly by equipment sales",sales,Negative,NIL
"We continue to expect full-year constant-currency revenue to be in the mid-single digits with about one point of negative translation currency, a modest improvement to our previous assumptions",sales,,
"Looking at the second half, consistent with our previous commentary, we expect improving equipment revenue trends",sales,,
"Q3 should improve over Q2, although we won't get the full quarter's benefit from all the new products or realize larger deal, mostly MDS benefits, given the inherently longer sales cycle on these deals",products_services,,
"Thus, Q4 will represent peak revenue performance for the year, with further benefits extending into 2018 with post sale, which lags, should also begin to reflect benefits from our initiatives",sales,,
Operating margins show good sequential and year-over-year improvement in Q2. Transaction currency again dampened margins in Q2 by about negative 100 basis points year-over-year,"sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"At current rates, we expect more moderate impact in the second half, especially in Q4. Overall, we anticipate continued strong margins in Q3, although seasonally, Q3 is not as strong as what we'll see in Q4, where typically margins peak for us","sales,earnings",Positive,Confident
"For the year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin between 12.5% and 13.5%","sales,earnings",,
"Lastly, in looking at the trends for adjusted EPS with two quarters left, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $3.20 and $3.44, essentially chopping out the top end of the range as that relied on a more rapid rollout of the new products",products_services,,
We expect EPS to follow the trend in revenue with peak performance in Q4. Q3 is seasonally the second weakest quarter of the year after Q1 and historically has made up about 24% of full-year EPS,sales,,
I'll now shift to discuss cash flow,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Operating cash flow generation coming in from continuing operations in the quarter was strong again at $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year",,Positive,Confident
"And free cash flow was $322 million, up $101 million year-over-year",,,
"Cash flow was driven by working capital timing and improvements, including in accounts payable related to the timing of supplier and vendor payments, the impact of lower equipment sales, a benefit to both accounts receivable and finance receivables, as well as the weighting of pension contributions to the second half of this year",,,
"Through the first half, we have contributed $46 million of a planned approximately $350 million for the full year",,,
Investing cash flows were a use of $77 million and included $65 million related to a GIS acquisition and CapEx spend of $21 million,acquisitions,,
"Cash used in financing was $80 million and reflected $68 million in dividends, both common and preferred",,,
"So overall, we continue to feel good about cash flow and are maintaining our full-year guidance of $700 million to $900 million in operating cash flow from continuing services",products_services,Neutral,Uncertain
"Turning now to capital structure slide, I will spend a few minutes on debt",debt,,
"We ended Q2 with $5 billion in debt, which is consistent with Q1 ending debt balance and lower than 2016 ending debt balance of $6.3 billion, reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments we did in the first quarter",debt,,
"As we highlighted previously, a focus area for us in 2017 is getting our capital structure aligned to the new Xerox",,,
We have made good progress and we continue to look to ways to optimize our balance sheet,,,
"Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.6 billion is allocated to financing debt, calculated by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our customer financing asset of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $464 million of equipment on operating leases",debt,,
And I will remind everyone that this financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage,debt,,

But we're still very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13. 5% range and believe we're set up pretty well for that,,,
"revenues mid-single-digit down in constant currency for the full year; first half, we are 5.4% down",sales,Negative,NIL
"We believe the second half will be better than the 5.4% down at constant currency with once again Q4 being the strongest quarter of the year and Q4 being better than Q3. From an operating cash flow perspective, once again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we ended for Q2 at $343 million, $533 million for the first half of this year",,Positive,Confident
"And I think most everybody knows and I'll just remind everyone the timing of our pension payments we gave guidance towards $350 million in pension payments for the full year, which is still on track, but only $46 million were made in the first half",,,Uncertain
So a lot of the pension payments are back loaded,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"There's also some timing of payables, with payables management that was a help in the first half that won't necessarily repeat in the second half",,,
"So then after all that getting to your question regarding the adjusted EPS and really, there a lot of factors as you can imagine that go into it",,,
There are some favorable things in particular,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"Currency, we think based on current spot rates, will be a little bit better than we had expected as far as the headwind at the beginning of the year, in particular in Q4. And Q3 will probably be similar as far as the negative impact to the first half of the year, but Q4 we expect to have a more modest negative impact from a currency perspective",,,Uncertain
The Fuji Xerox provision is clearly a favorable item,,,
"And in the first quarter, we took that $30 million hit on that and that was revised $24 million or most of it was revised out",,,
"So, some favorable items there, but to get to the higher end of the range, a few things",,,
"We had â€“ everything had to go right regarding the product transition, and Jeff, in a lot of his comments talked about that",products_services,,

"We plan to have â€“ we want to have flexibility, continue to do as much of that as we can",,,
We've done a fair amount in first half,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We want to continue doing that in the second half of the year,,,
"And this, leaving â€“ to answer your question specifically, leaving the lower end of the range opened or not adjusting that leaves you opportunity to be flexible, where opportunities arise in the A4 area",,,
"And then, one of the bigger things is that, from a tax perspective, we gave guidance range of 25% to 28% for the full year for effective tax rate",,,
"And year-to-date, we've been in the 27% range",not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
We think that might be lower a little bit with some things you see and maybe in the second half,,,Uncertain

All those things factor in,not_applicable,Neutral,NIL
"We thought it was prudent to narrow the range, given half the year is up and we basically removed the top 25% or $0.08 from it",,,
Just a little bit on a strategic cost transformation,op_costs,,
"As everyone knows, last year we overachieved with respect to the $500 million target and achieved by $550 million",,,
"In 2016, we stated a goal for $600 million, this year we are very pleased with where we're at year-to-date, and believe we are firmly on track to meeting that target and hopefully exceeding it",,,
"Which would lead to, obviously, your $1.15 billion, if I'm doing my math right, that we're likely very much on the plus side of the $1.5 billion for the three years when you factor in 2018. But as far as formally giving an updated number, it'll probably be later this year",,,
But we are very confident in being â€“ hitting the $600 million this year and overachieving on the $1.5 billion,,,
"But to give updated three-year number later this year, we'll give that",,,
"So yeah, I'd agree, this incremental about $500 million over three years versus what was more BAU already on the cost reductions",op_costs,,
"But one of the main reasons why was to allow for investment and investment includes things like the A4s, being able to sell A4s up front, which are at a negative margin or a loss initially but profitable over the life","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",Positive,Uncertain
"But it also offsets other headwinds, such as currency",,,
"We've had significant currency headwinds, both last year and this year, and the incremental amounts over the BAU allowed us to still increase margins despite those currency headwinds, and like I said, it allows us to do investments, so the investment in selling initial A4s or investments in the way we are doing things internally","sales,earnings,organic_expansion",,
"Yeah, I would say clearly, it would be a mix that there would be a mix of investments",organic_expansion,,
"But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future","earnings,op_costs",Neutral,Uncertain

But we do expect there's a normal ramp from Q3 to Q4 that occurs,,,
We expect there to be more of a ramp this year than in prior years just because of the full availability of our products at that point in time,products_services,,
"As far as EPS and operating cash flow, once again, there are a lot of variabilities, as you know, that go into operating cash flow",,,
"And one of them in particular is the pension contributions, and we've said $350 million",,,
It's an area that we look at closely as far as our funded pension status,,,
And just want to leave things open from the perspective of whether we want to have flexibility for maybe additional funding there,,Neutral,Uncertain

"So I would though recommend you, CJ, go to our website",,,
We're going to update what we expect to be the impact on diluted share count from the redemption of the convert in this quarter,,,
"Like I said, it's fairly complex, but we've tried to make it understandable",,,
