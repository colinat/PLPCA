11,PenguinPower,"Rules
Rules shamelessly stolen from various moderators.

General RulesAll site rules apply here.You may not quote private Moderator-supplied information (real or otherwise) of any kindThere is to be NO personal communication outside of the forum postings unless your role PM specifically allows it. If someone contacts you outside the game, report it to me IMMEDIATELYAdvertising future games, or games currently in sign-ups, is forbidden.  This game will start with a Day phaseNo ciphers, encryption, extremely small text, or other similar tactics.If you have the ability to edit, refrain from doing so.It's your responsibility to read and understand all of the rules.
ActivityAim for one post every 48 hours at a minimum.  After 48 hours of no activity, I will prod the inactive playerA prodded player has 24 hours to respond to my prod with a substantive post in game, after which time a replacement search will begin.  I abhor prodging.A player who has been prodded 3 times will be subject to replacement with no further noticeIf you plan on being inactive for more than 48 hours, PM the Mod to notify you plan on being V/LA. If you plan to have regularly scheduled V/LA period (e.g. the weekend) please PM the mod to notify
DeadlinesDays will last 14 daysNights will last 48 hoursExtensions may be given out in extreme circumstances, and is up to the discretion of the ModIf you have a role with a Night action, your action is due to the Mod by the posted deadline.  If no action is received by the posted deadline, you may forfeit your action(s).  Players with a Night action may submit a ""No Action"" PM to indicate to the Mod you do not wish to perform your action.
Player Rules/VotingA simple majority of all living players must agree on one person (via voting) for a Lynch to occur (simple majority = Â½ # of living players +1, rounded down). If no one has a simple majority of votes at deadline a No Lynch will occur.Votes should use Vote Tags or they may not be counted (VOTE: (Player Name)). Unvotes should use Unvote Tags or they may not be counted (UNVOTE: (Player Name)). Unvotes are helpful, but not required.  You may VOTE: No Lynch - a simple majority (as described above) of No Lynch votes will result in a No Lynch and a move to the Night phase.Votes/Unvotes should be placed on a line all by themselves to make them easier for everyone to see.  Do this.Votes in quotes, spoiler tags or otherwise hidden will also not be counted.Votes that misspell or have other minor errors will be counted as normal as long as I understand what you are getting at.Once a player has reached a simple majority of votes no further unvoting will change their fate. Tough.When a player is lynched the game enters twilight until the Mod posts a death scene; all players may continue to post.If you are killed (either via lynch or night kill) you may no longer post except for one brief â€œBah!â€�-type post that contains that must contain a cute image of a Penguin.
Misc RulesThis is my color.  I don't like to share, so don't use it.I'm perfect, but there may be an appearance of a mistake on occasion.  This is intentional.  Please PM me privately to address. I will correct any of these intentional mistakes where possible, but there may be situations that I cannot.  Sorry. Be at peace knowing those were intentional as well.Bold all requests to the Mod so that I don't intentionally miss them.Rule violations will be dealt with based upon severity - up to a Modkill - at the sole discretion of the ModAny situation not specifically covered in the above Rules is subject to Mod discretion and will be handled as the Mod sees fit to address.  Live with it.This game is a confirmed 10:3 setup.",71796,2017-05-12 11:52:00,1

1) I don't think I agree that it doesn't help. It may not be as effective as RVS, but it's still a starting point.
2) It doesn't need to stagnate anything. RVS and RQS are not mutually exclusive and people can easily do both at once.

I don't have a lot of past MS games to show you, but arguing against cases on other people like this is a thing I do regularly in mafia. If I see someone being scumread for bad reasons, even if I'm nullreading the person on the receiving end, I'm likely going to argue and engage over it for two reasons:

1) I want to better understand the opposing argument and possibly call them out for scum-driven reasoning (this is the main reason)

2) I don't want someone to be lynched for reasons that I think are unjustified.

Can you just tag people instead of quoting right after they post? That's a little unnecessary. Notice I and Transcend don't like walls. 

@Gamma: Can you also do the same? (less quoting, more just concise posts, although you have been a bit more concise, I just want you to acknowledge this)

I don't think it's something that a townie would neccecarily go full ham on defending him for.  It seems such a weird thing, and he is IMMEDIATELY almost white knighted for a LONG time by sparkles.  The possibility here is that the person he is defending is Town and he is setting up TvT conflicts.  I see in a lot of games scum trying to buddy up to town, just beacuse pyschologically it helps that town read them back and also because it sets up conflicts between the aggresor and accused.

but now I'm gonna justify my hypocrisy by saying that this is totally different and since I have meta I actually have a basis for categorizing certain aspects of a give player's play as NAI

fuck why the fuck am I using NAI now y'all have fucking poisoned me

Anyway mulch seems gross af but kinda doubting scummulch openly antagonizes that much so early in D1. He's practically lynchbaiting himself.

well what you said re: including oneself in reads lists is arguably pretentious because you could have been insinuating that it's been awhile since you've seen it by virtue of the implication that it's low level play that you haven't seen since a less a time of less developed meta or something similar

looks like he doesn't want to commit to his actions which imo isn't genuine

something feels off about gamma this game. i don't know if i'm not liking his tone, his progression or a mixture of both. his mild tr on me looks kinda fake given that i don't think i've done anything alignment indicative

mulch is my top townread for aforementioned reasons. that hasn't changed. ryker is also town imo but confbiased which is kinda annoying, but inevitable in some players

agent sparkles also pinged me a bit bc i didn't like him trying to shame those who didn't participate in rqs. looks a bit like reaching.

Mulch is using hyperbolic speech for something that seemed fairly benign to me.
Sparkles explained himself already and it seems pretty reasonable but still ""such a weird thing"" for Mulch, which seems unreasonable.

On the topic of Sparkles defending that one guy for asking those mod questions that Mulch didn't like AdumbroDeus says
 when it's not. I imagine the reasoning here though is how sloppy Mulch is being, in the sense that he just says these things, which I suppose isn't unreasonable metaplay. 
Says 
Which I would now like him to explain because I really am not seeing it. 
But then:

I suppose he doesn't think Mulch is too bombastic to be town, but he actually likes the reasoning he's given. This doesn't seem right, cuz Mulch's reasoning isn't right. 
AdumbroDeus +1 for you

Mulch +1
Back to 67 I lost in LYLO cuz scum looked squeaky clean compared to the character that was town and so I don't wanna fall for that again. Vote for people please. You literally do not scunrrad everyone

I'll have to agree with Mulch and Ryker regarding the defensiveness argument. Town have plenty of incentive to defend themselves against a lynch, as it's part of their wincon just like if they were scum. To suggest that town are expected to react passively or not try to knock down the points brought up against them is ridiculous, especially if the cases against them are bad ones. The problem is in how people defend themselves, and whether their reactions/emotions seem genuine under the circumstances.

80- My prior experience comes from Epicmafia (which has real time games instead of forum ones) and games with IRL friends, so I'll have to disappoint you here.

84- Indecisive at the moment. Scum for his strange pushes and exaggerations of NAI things, town for his general proactivity and aggressive play.

87- I get the feeling you're also exaggerating NAI things. What about asking what was wrong with a reaction is ""blowing things out of proportion?""

Ryker's reply to Transcend in 154 pings me and I'm surprised that people haven't brought it up. There's no reason (especially as page 7) to write someone off as a lynch target like that and refuse to engage them. There's zero town motivation in that, especially given how little AI content there had been from Transcend so far.

158 is a blatant misrep- at the time of him saying this, Transcend had barely brought up the idea of a Mulch townread and Mulch arbitrarily jumps on him for it. This is a real stretch even compared to his earlier case on me.

179- @Gamma Emerald, what caused your change in opinion on his defense? If anything, it seems like it was more of what made you suspect him.

I'm not sure I'm getting @FrozenFlame's page 9 scumread of Gamma. Gamma comments that he hasn't seen anyone include themselves in a readslist in a long time, so FF assumes he's being pretentious without much cause and thinks it's scummy?

239- @LaLight, that's far from true and I've already gone into why. Did you skip over my explanation completely or just ignore it?

263- Agree with the points about his sheep vote and OMGUS accusation, but I don't think you responded to this part:



which I'm curious about myself. Also, your accusation of me trying to ""shame"" people is eww and really not what happened.

275- One person doesn't necessarily speak for everyone. There were maybe 5 people who saw the term RQS and went ""nope, moving on""

Mulch's jump on Transcend is still bleh. Stating that scum getting wagoned will try to townread their lynchers is ignoring that 1) The wagon on Transcend happened after his townread of Mulch, not before, and 2) any decent town are not always going to scumread people who scumread them.

329 and 337- Please explain.

@AdumbroDeus- Want to see your response to 384

I want to hear more from everyone who just jumped on the Zulfy bandwagon.
@Gamma: Why do you scumread him?
@Transcend: Why isn't your vote on your top scumread instead of a random bandwagon?

If I can explain the early votes, again, I voted someoneo random because I wanted to see their reaction to being greeted with an early vote.  Not that it matters now, but I was going to slightly townread them if they got a little annoyed and slightly scumread them if they acted really nonchalant about it.

I understand what you guys want me to do involving botes, but just because I don't like one person's post that dosen't mind im gonna vote them.  If you notice, I like to reply to single posts and just say my thoughts on all of them as I go along- I think it shows transparency and helps me back up what I am saying later for my sake and others.  I'm not going to vote someone for every post I dislike or I would be throwing votes all over the place.  

Activity shoulen't be used to measure scum level- in my first ever game of forum mafia I played very active and I was scum, and nobody scumread me the entire game.  

My home site is Town of Salem forums btw and it is very active",71796,2017-05-14 14:15:00,524

541,FireScreamer,"Okey dokey.  Let's do this.  I'll do an actual factual big wall of catchup to make up for being an inactive ian.  

Just gonna randomly note stuff as I see it.  Obviously early stuff is gonna matter less.  

Page 1:  Hate RQS, like transcend naked voting it though I guess thats totally free for him to do as scum, Zulfy doing his best Switzerland impersonation.

Page 2: Mulch slapping down a Ranmaru questioning of AS.  (Pushing reactions on NAI things, particularly that early is still a fine way to be spending your time).  Townleaning AS for being curious about peoples reactions to RQS.  Ranmaru shares my opinion on RQS, though I don't think strongly stating an opinion either way is AI at this point.  42 is a pretty hamfisted push of a new player, though possibly by a new player.  Mulch overreaction to Gamma asking him to explain an action.  

Ranmaru ^, AS ^, Mulch V

Page 3: Liking the mulchwagon here.  Still complaining about his ""good vote"" that was just voteparking someone who hadn't done anything, which is busywork.  Mulch wagon on AS is ABSURD.  Gamma starts an attempt at sorting Ryker with what I think is a fabricated read.  (Which doesn't mean I scum read it).  

Page 4: 76 pings me.  Didn't he make a song and dance about noticing someone had a ""self preservation meta""?   I think newer players in particular tend to be overly defensive.  I do not scumread Ryker for it.  I agree that the read works on the whole but the main thing about any read is that it fits who you are applying it to.  I guess the Gamma read on page 3 was genuine, though shortsighted.  

Page 5: This page is like a crash course in reasons people townread people when they shouldn't.",71796,2017-05-14 20:33:00,531

Page 7: Oh the transcend scum case is just NIA trancend shit.  It rubbed me the wrong way in my first game with him too.  He will actually eventually engage enough to be sorted. Pushing him now is lazy and easy.  

Page 8: A bunch of off site stuff and nothing I can point to as AI for anyone. 

Page 9 : Pushing AS for being engaged about things he didn't agree with is still bad.  Pushing Transcend for transcend things is still bad.  I'm sad that Gamma doesn't consider me in the pretentious/bravado archetype of player.  I try my best dammit.   Hate how antagonistic FF is.  Did they just learn the word pretentious or something?

The person I have a concern with right now is Lalight. Mulch pushed AS due to faulty reasoning and Lalight hopped on. I don't see any drive to find scum. According to Agent Sparkles, it seems Lalight hasn't been reading carefully enough to see AS explain his own actions. His reasoning seems tacked on and lazy. His explanation about weekends is vague, doesn't really help us have a good time to sit down with him and sort him out, and gives him an opportunity to lurk. He is slight newb scum to me. That shows you that currently my leads are thin. Motivation as scum: Follow an aggressive player, seem like he is hunting, and fly under the radar since he can't find the will to care to actually try.

662,LaLight,"So, I got a wagon. Cool. I admit I put really not much effort in this game, but yeah, all my weekends are gonna be semivla. Should put that somewhere.

First of all, sorry, Agent, I did miss it. UNVOTE: Ageent Sparkles

A little fact about my meta: I never townread people unless I have a result or I am scum or they are Innocent Child. Best result you can be in my eyes is null. Sorry. 

Bow I don't really have any strong reads. I will when the game will advance and if I won't be lynched, but not right now.

I don't like Mulch's play at all. Most of the posts are quite simple and empty, everyone who looks at him says he's newbie and tr's him. Actually, being newbie!scum is the easiest thing to do ever, because if you do something suspicious and strange like flailing, weak reasoning, etc. you may always say you're newbie and people will say, well, yeah, it works. There is, of course a problem that you may still be a town!newbie with all that stuff, but I don't buy it. 

Firescreamer lurking for some time and coming into game aggressively and textwally after called for it is scummy imo.

Gut says Ryker is scum. OMGUS, you'll say, but no, actually. I was thinking so while rereading not seeing then that I have a wagon. I just read through Ryker's ISO and can't find a single thing to look into really. What is he doing? I mean yeah, he's posting, but for what reason? I don't see it.

This


Is the PERFECT example of distancing. I mean well, you have a lot of people to analyze, do you say they're all townie so you look into someone else to analyze? No one does that. Make a case and advance it, this post above doesn't do anything other than distracting attention to the player.

And it doesn't matter that that player reacted scummily. You can both be scum.


D1 from my experience is a little worse than D2 but still the best time to distance yourself from your partners. I still can't believe it was that easy in 1903, when I made like 5 posts about how rb is scummy, he's made couple of posts about how I am scummy, I made a post like ""who's creature"" (Creature, rb, me were scumbuddies) and in the end it all worked out. I am saying, you should never say things like Zulfy vs Mulch because they may try to distance each other. But time and flips will tell.

Now I am perfectly comfortable with VOTE: Ryker and I think you all should be too.",71796,2017-05-15 06:02:00,652

Because no one has ever done anything that could indicate them as town. It can always be a part of a scheme. I've been there both as scum scheming and as town being blind about it.

More words about me voting for AS. I will be honest, do with it whatever you want to. Back then it was hard to catch up, so I decided to take any scummy thing I will see in thread and try to make it look like a strong reasoning when in truth it was like 1/4 RVS.

Scummy
Scummy x 2, Scum loves to say such things
scummyish, when a person is aware of his meta, he may play the same as town and scum. That's why ""I am town because it's my meta"" is a bullshit argument

His style is really weird, but I've met people like this on this site and mostly they were towns in those games. Jumping on my wagon is really bad though, and this playstyle is the playstyle one can easily fabricate. Shitposting, if I remember the term correctly. Would Lynch. 

marshy
1st post
2nd post
3rd post
4th post

Every post is a vote (okay, I can skip the RVS one, but after that?) without any plausible reasoning.

Then something not really informative/hunting and this. Null to scum.

Mulch
Just as I have said, newb!scum in my eyes. Too much posting, requires a standalone reread.

LaLight
IC

FireScreamer
Let's look closer.

VLA till this post.
This series of posts is both good and bad. Bad because it's had to read and check, which is convenient for Fire if he's scum. Good because I do like the reasoning behind every page and it really looks like he was writing that while reading that, which is good. But scum can do that too.

Voting for me without saying anything about his scumread on Deus. Why change the mind if I haven't posted anything till then? And also not trying to push till then, just fluffing. Jumping on wagon like this is supadupa scummy.

Agent Sparkles
This is a VERY good post. Interacting with various people, sumhunting. Agent Sparkles is second closest to nulltown for me now. He's consistent.

Zulfy
Good one!
Here the reasoning behind every +1 is weak. Well, I am not saying mine are strong, but zulfy tends to formulate things the way like he's thinking his reasoning is strong. Though i agree about Mulch here, but it's all easily seen.
This is the post I like less than others. Mulch was talking about his point on asking questions, but here, the very you are prolonging the discussion the way you yourself described.

Ranmaru
The closest guy to townread. Posts are consistent, interacts with everyone. I have already said my thoughts on them.

FrozenFlame
Another person I completely forgot about. Let's see.

Why am I having an impression of reading rb, omg.
Hard. This, this and this look good in the game context, but after this 90% is fluff. Like he pretended to be scumhunting for a while, got his townreads and hid.

Ryker
Scumread, explanation above.

AdumbroDeus
How many people are in this game I keep forgetting about.

Mostly Asking for opinions without giving his own

Tammy
Ah, the guy is VLA. 3 posts only. I wonder why the only thing he cared to mention was this one o_O

Gamma Emerald

Entire post is super mechanical without regard for context.

Completely dismissing newbie town as a read ignores that there are clear differences in play between noob-town and noobscum, they can be confused for each other of course but all reads are contextual and there are completely different noobtown and noobscum impulses.

Textwalls are usually necessary to catch up to games with a lot of material, and aggressive is a playstyle.

Saying a slot that literally only had a vote with no content up to that point is forgettable is distancing? Really?

This post in particular really captures this mentality imo.

Obviously there's an incentive for scum to do this too because scum can't get legitimate reads so mechanical reads are their only tools, but I think his 35 and 36 strongly suggest it wasn't the case. His 3 does somewhat conflict, but not enough to knock me off the read.

#455 and #456 and#764 don't line up with his preference of being logical as stated in his #23. This seems a bit less fueled by being rational but rather by emotion. It was quite jumpy, and then he backs up realizing it wasn't a good push. Agent Sparkles is asked a good question by Lalight, and takes a long while to answer. This is another example of his lack of follow up. He is content with dropping his vote on Lalight without any extra analysis.

826,Ranmaru,"@Ryker: Sparkles doesn't have the motivation to follow up. He tries to seem logical, but then makes a gutsy jump on Gamma and backtracks without truly thinking about it first. His play seems calculated, for example the mulch questioning doesn't lead to a conclusion, his vote on Lalight isn't really substantiated nor does he really go that deep into analyzing him as he has asked. Only until pressure builds does he come back to answer. (I waited a bit too but can't wait that long, have martial arts soon)

Null-town for Transcend. The dude does have a gut style of play, and I have seen him get lynched for that (and partially Gamma's fault too) in Thing Mafia. I say null-town since I have had him as null for the longest time but like his vote placements. I've had problems with him back when he used to be SodaSpirit, and really I can't say that I'll be able to have a strong read of him without a flip. I will have the same amount of difficulty reading him as I do with Marshy. The only thing that helps me with Marshy is I have been his scum buddy before, and have seen him be opportunistic af in another game. His play in Serenes Forest too. So I have some understanding of how Marshy plays as both alignments. Thing is I have only played one game (Thing Mafia) with Trascend before this. It's why I was asking Gamma to verify things for me, as I know they have a little bit more history together. (Even though Gamma may not feel confident in reading him, I'd still want some idea of how he plays)

So it was Null > Null-town. I generally agreed with you that his initial start was garbage and was fine with wagoning him at that point. The only concern I have is his telling me that my Lalight vote won't go anywhere without really reading that thoroughly enough. I can definitely understand his null on me since in Thing Mafia he was town reading me hard, I was definitely trying to appeal to him there.

833,Ryker,"I'm basically trying to PoE my reads right now and reach a reasonable lynchpool. At the moment, the number of slots I'm content with losing is too high to be of any use.

Not ordered in any way outside of the brackets.

~~

Ryker - Obv town.

Mulch -  Newbie for certain, but remains on my town list because I've yet to see the opportunism present in new scum. I have no qualms with the slot at the moment and if I'm wrong, it will become painfully apparent as the game goes on.

Ran - Town. I like Ran. He pokes and prods and I can very easily see the thought process behind his votes (ex. Mulch vote gets the game going. Firescreamer and Lalight votes to prod inactives. Agent Sparkles currently attempting to read).

Adum - His read list makes a lot of sense to me and mirrors a fair amount of my sentiment. The greatest point of contention I have with it is the Transcend slot which I am waffling on constantly, more on that later. In addition, his readlist is quite obviously in line with his behavior in thread and is demonstrably the result of his line of inquiry.

Marshy - I like Marshy as much as I can like Marshy. All I have are his votes, but I like his votes within the context of when they were placed.

~~

There ends the slots I would be sad to lose.

~~

Lalight - God I hate his recent post. I hate his read on me. I hate his read on FF. I hate his read on Mulch. I hate his meta comment on town votes and his read on Adum looks worse now, but that's unfair because the curtain was only recently pulled back. In addition, I like his read on Firescreamer. The ones that have been talked about less are: his read on Transcend, which is passable. His read on Sparkles is based on one (albeit a good one) post and ignores everything else, calling Sparkles ""consistent"" while only linking one post. I don't know what consistent means. Zulfy read final point seems like a fabricated reason to keep Zulfy at arm's length and I dislike it. Gamma Emerald he has no read on, which is somewhat understandable as well because he hasn't done anything major despite his high post count. Tammy and Marshy reads are both fine.

In the end, I REALLY don't like dealing with this slot, but get used to it because there's a lot of that.

Gamma Emerald - This guy has been all over the thread and has done nothing that jumps out to me at all. Would love not to have to read this slot, but I think it will require going through 30 pages just to see if I can find anything of value. I have absolutely nothing on this slot and that's a point against it at this stage. I would like him to give me some crispy reads so I can update my profile of him.

Transcend - I waffle on this slot, CONSTANTLY. Intro was disgusting, you saw me post about it. A lot of people jumped onto the slot for garbage reasons though. There were reasons to be on it, but I wasn't seeing it from most of the posters. The only one I can recall appreciating was Adum's most recent comments on him. I put this slot from scum, to town when I reconsidered that his self-meta garbage might just be distasteful to me and causing me to misread him, to scummier because I haven't seen him doing any meaningful scumhunting. I don't like reading this slot. He reminds me of how much I hate reading J.

Tammy - Complete crapshoot.

FF - Intro was good. I legitimately liked it. He was town on my list at that point. I haven't seen much of anything solid since then and that's concerning.

Sparkles - Doesn't. Do. Anything. He had one good post (#443), but I can mirror Ran after skimming back through that he never seems to go anywhere. I want a readslist from Sparkles.

Firescreamer - Grody slot. Can die. I cannot actively recall him actively pushing forward. Will click the ISO button and revisit.

Zulfy - BADLY need him to update his reads. All I can recall standing out is his read on Mulch, which is poorly formed.

~~

If I had to limit myself, it would be Firescreamer, Zulfy, Lalight, and Transcend. All of those slots can die for me at this point.

Fair, it's really striking how he has strong stances but seems completely uninterested in following through with them or making pushes.

When he properly entered the game he had town pretty much wrapped around his finger for quite a while, you even commented on his apparent skill outstripping his apparent experience. I agree with you, his play is highly calculated, which isn't inherently a scumtell, but when somebody's so obviously not following up on their stances and doing it in a calculated way it's super grimey. No proactive pushing and only interested in defending and disengaging from his scumreads, argh.



I don't think he's an easy read, that's compared to the other two who I view as monstrously hard reads. 

But in my experience there's a consistent thread in Ryker's scumplay where he uses his town control abilities as a truncheon with priority aimed at defining the entire game. As town he tends to split evenly between the two until he gets a feel for the game or actively limiting town control play. In this game he's been ignoring town control in favor of actively scumhunting at every opportunity, and while the presence of other people who have strong town control abilities might be part of this, they're too inactive for that to make sense.",71796,2017-05-15 19:08:00,841

No, no. Come back my friend.

You're voting him, but he isn't the scummiest of the rest. That's fine. Give me a list, I asked you for that as well and didn't get it. Who are the scummiest. Bottom 4. Which of them do you think is THE scummiest? Which is the SECOND scummiest? Which is the THIRD scummiest? Why are the four of them down there.

Your reads are fabricated on weak reasoning. You're currently doing exactly the thing I said your comment about not having townreads would let you do and going back on one of your stronger reads.




How many slots in this game aren't consistent? If it's such a big thing, surely there are more players who are logical and consistent!

That's why I started behaving inadequately (speaking, then thinking).

I think it's weird that LaLight never townreads people but I don't think it is a scumtell, I think its another meta arguement.
I am NOT a newbie, unless you count newbie = <10 games.  I understand that people are townreading me for this but I don't get what is so illogical in what I am saying.
I respect gut reads; it is actually more accurate than logic reads a lot of the time.
OMGUS vote but you back it up with reasoning; I am not going to fault you on that.

Gamma asking why he never townreads people is a little weird, it seems unnececary.

Ranmaru made a valid point saying you are not SCUM HUNTING, which I consider a huge scum tell, so it was again weird when Gamma decided to jump on Ran for doing that.

The lynchbait comment by Light is not as big of a scumtell as people are saying, I use that arguement with BOTH scum and town and I think a lot of people would too.  Light is fine for saying it especailly because she actually backed it up with posts.

Did anyone else find it weird that Transcend called that self meta disgutsting when he did that himself?

Ranmaru seems to be really into asking people to explain things, it's getting weird, almost as if its free towncred
Gamma townreads light for ""really trying to scumhunt"".  If that was true I would agree (its a big town tell), but as far as I can tell Lalight just called out Ryker, so I don't quite understandit.
Ryker: Definitely still willing to lynch lalight- I get that it's your meta but I don't like this basically non explanation subtle shade throwing, and I think his push is atrocious for not having town reads.  That is NOT a scumtell, and I think he would be experienced enough to know that, if I do.
I really really like Ranmaru's push on Light- Light said something incrediblt scummy about ""creating"" a scumread and he jumped on him appropriately.

I was more messing with Gamma in 224 than anything else really. He asked me a shitty false dilemma style question so I gave him a deliberately non-responsive answer. He was trying to force me between ""be blowing hot air"" and ""commit to saying you scum read me"" as if that is the only reason someone would vote for someone, especially within the first 24 hours of the game. I felt like he was trying to corner me with those forced choices so I was non-responsive and didn't give him the answer he wanted. I just reasserted I'd vote for him, but said I was busy doing something else at the moment. I was just being snarky, not trying to say I had some crazy hard read that that point. Like I said, I wasn't exactly being deliberate in my engagements that early in the game.



Gamma I've been ribbing because ever since his start with RQS, getting rattled by marshy's declaration of RQS being over (a la post 18), and generally just coming off as needing control and conformity to his standards of play, I've decided being antagonistic to this slot would be the best way to help me read it. Try to throw him off, bait unfiltered reactions and the like. Hasn't been as successful as I'd hoped as Gamma didn't bite as hard as I wanted, but still gave me some insight into the slot. Slot also has lots of early commentary on what exactly it is that mafiats like to do/not do which is always a narrative that scum love to control. But idk this guy likes to be passively authoritative so maybe he'd still be chomping at the bit to have that discussion as town.

Transcend I like pretty much only for consistency in votes, and choice of votes (except for when he voted me   ). AS, Zulfy and Gamma are all fine plays IMO so I'll give him some cred. Also was expecting him to try to take more advantage of my early game laziness after he went and took my initial ""big"" post so seriously. When he dropped it after my response it made him seem slightly less opportunistic but he also seems good enough to realize pushing that too hard would've looked really bad and didn't want to catch full heat for pushing a lynch on such a shaky basis. Not quite a townread but not a top end play today IMO.



bro is it really ""bleedingly obvious?"" I like to think of myself as decently observant but I mean, though I agree its easy for him to cop out and just say ""lol I didn't mean it that way"" I don't necessarily think your read of his intent is so perfectly clear. This feels a little forced though I could see townbrodeus getting hung up on something like that if he was really subjectively sure of his read being correct. Adum you're going through a lot of effort here to be illustrative of what you've determined to be Trascend's intent which is making it hard to tell if that's genuine description or baity rhetoric for distracting but persuasive effect. Like a descriptive hitjob.



Yall are definitely overestimating me at this point bros, you gotta remember this is my second game after a long ass hiatus. I'm still shaking off the rust, marshy can attest, I scrubbed it up in our last game together over on xkcd



Prob Zulfy, Sparkles, LaLight, Gamma in nor particular order right now. Still thinking about where to push for real rn



Literally ISO'd you bro and didn't see a single @ FF or something similar so not sure what question you're looking for me to answer. Whatever it was it wasn't clear",71796,2017-05-16 00:59:00,865
876,Ranmaru,@FireScream: Could you answer my questions please.,71796,2017-05-16 01:01:00,866
877,Ranmaru,"@Mulch: First of all, questioning is usually my playstyle preference. It is easy to do, and it is seen as beneficial for scum since scum use it to seem like they are doing things when they are not. (Well I guess weaker scum players) Thing is I am actually doing things and using those questions to develop my reads. Also, I'm just curious by nature. It's like how you always interact heavily with people that are talking about you. Do you see my questions leading somewhere or not?

The 'what's your opinion on ME' question comes to mind. Not scummy, just seems like something you do as a player. Sometimes you have to consider if something is playstyle or just an alignment thing. Town will do things to find scum and will naturally get towncred if they are playing right, but their focus isn't to gain the towncred but to find scum. Scum will play simply to gain the towncred. Get it? Does it seem like I'm trying to find scum or simply trying to gain towncred?

This is what I outline with my case on Agent Sparkles. He seems like he is doing things for town cred (seeming logical in his #433) but never actually cares to follow up, which would lead to 'finding scum'. He doesn't seem like he really cares to sort people, look at how long it took him to respond to Lalight's question about 'what about my other posts?' and he only answers once I post my case on him.",71796,2017-05-16 01:11:00,867

Once I see something worth lynching I'll explain my read and why I think it.  I'll repeat the read, I'll change the way I explain it, I'll openly ask people I see in the thread to just join it.  

I do this regardless of alignment.  I have a desire to be the one leading discussion.  I don't have super developed reads past people I wanted to see better posting from in this game yet.  It's early.  Ill find something worth pushing as I get more invested in the game.  

Once I get my wheels going and people understand me this method helps me be townread.  I've never been lynched.  I just have to get better about letting people iterate and change my reads.  Once I see something worth pushing I can tunnel.

I do see your questoins leading somwhere, but they are somewhat constant.  Good point on parts of your meta.  Speaking of that, you do realize you just used a self meta arguement lol.  I wonder if people will jump on you idiotically like they have others.

Anyway the reason I brought it up is because I thought it could be an easy way to gain towncred.  It's a fine line between being town and trying to be too townie.  On ToS forums I got torn apart and called an idiot once for calling someone trying to be too townie. ""Your supposed to be too townie, retard"" was basically their response.  Oh well, I'm not changing my mind about it.  But I'm glad you can acknoledge this and respond.

Hey, good morning!

From scummiest on:
Ryker
Agent Sparkles

I think, we just don't understand each other and I would love to try to explain. I wouldn't call people consistent just because they are logical, I'd call them logical then. For example, Adum is logical, but not very consistent. Ranmaru is the most consistent person. Transcend is the least. Well, I feel like I can't easily explain this. Let's call it ""Calm, Logical and Trustworthy"" and forget about this stupid word.

I don't see Adum consistent for this post and alike (This for example). He forgets some topics going only agter his read. Again, I don't say it's necessarily scummy, I say it's not townie, may be even null. Consistency is a towntell, non-consistency is not a scum tell, unless it's like very non-consistent, throwing votes and accusations around and forgetting them that very moment.

Talking about his push on FireScream.. well, FS explained me that my read on him was wrong, that he had scumtells and he could really change them to create additional push. But he doesn't seem very engaged into the scumhunting, more defensive, but I wouldn't call him overdefensive. 

I just like your case better.",71796,2017-05-16 06:28:00,923

Transcend

Null-town. I like his vote placements. His early game was garbage but Iâ€™m liking how he is progressing. 

Marshy

Slight gut town. I liked his tone when he joke fosâ€™d me. I donâ€™t feel Iâ€™d see him do that as mafia. I like his scumpool, but I want more.

Mulch

Town. Heâ€™s been active, scumhunting, and reacted well to pressure from early game. 

FrozenFlame

Null. I have no real idea where he is at. His not placing a vote at all is concerning. Yet it is still not enough for a solid read. He said he was going to post things after his lunch break, that never happened. I still want to see his full reads list and a vote.

Ryker

Slight town. I like the presence and the reads he has given so far. Have seen nothing to be concerned about. 

AdumbroDeus

Town. I noticed Adumbrodeus had his cards close to his chest, but I like his conclusions and agree with Ryker that they line up. I liked his questioning towards Fire Scream and Frozen. 

Tammy*

Null. I give her some leniency since I invited her and know from out of game that she said she had other games (3) before this one, yet she still joined. So I am giving her some space but I want to see her catch up and give a full reads list to make up for that.

Gamma Emerald
Town. He seems to be pushing what he believes in, I donâ€™t think heâ€™d be pushing Marshy and Ryker as scum. I donâ€™t agree with his logic and itâ€™s getting a bit of tin-foil hat. (With the gif between Ryker and Marshy)",71796,2017-05-16 17:13:00,964
975,Ranmaru,"Bottom Four:

Agent Sparkles

Scum. Lack of follow up, no motivation to find scum. Always seems to disappear after a while. Once after questioning Mulch (leaves no conclusion), once after voting Lalight (Lalight asked for analysis, no such thing around the time he asked), and once after I replied to his response to my case. He states being unmotivated but I take that as getting down because heâ€™s being pressured. He shows a calculated play, instead of having a genuine flow. It is incomplete. 784

Zulfy

He has had some faulty argument against Mulch. Yet since then he hasnâ€™t posted even since prodding. I had him as null and expected him to back up his shit, but he seems like he also has no motivation to find mafia and lurked out. He may die. 

Fire Scream

His catch up seemed thoughtful. Yet it was surface level. Fire Scream is a compromise for me. I want to see more, but I noticed he has been active in other games while being inactive in this one. His lack of motivation is concerning, and his town read of Agent Sparkles seems forced. 

Lalight

His initial vote hop on Agent Sparkles was not good. As I have explained, he showed a motive of seeming unnatural. His reasoning was weak, and it showed that he had not been reading. So the concern was following an aggressive player, and seem like he was hunting. He felt like finding a reason to scumread someone instead of taking the time to naturally do that. He's also last because I'm doubting the scumminess and possibly seeing bad town play and town frustration. Yet he's still a play because he knows how Appeal to Emotion works. In his last scum game he seemed to have been playing a better game there and won.

Agent sparkles I don't understand your unvote on Gamma...what did gamma do about feigning...over Wulfy?  I don't get it

Ok, yeah, Firescreamer's logic on how he does his unique way of scumreading is a little dubious

Agent sparkles still scumreads me..

I do think that wagon's being too easy IS a thing

Page 32:

Adumbro's read on me makes sense in the sense that I may be being too mechanical but the post he cited for it, 408, is like the antithesis of his arguement.  That is somwhere where I am saying you need context over mechanical and he is citing it for the opposite.  I don't get it.

FrozenFalme that post ALSO scumpings for me

Trancsend did you argue for the third tiem about labeling someone else as lynchbait when YOU did the same thing/

Ranmaru makes perfect sense as always, if you are scum then you are literally the best scum I have ever seen because you are like perfect in every way in your reasoning

What was the point of Marshy's post

I like Deu's point.

Page 33:

Lalight self meta

I like Ryker's aggresive nature

I would like Adumbro to explain his reads more.

Ranmaru brilliant again

Weird LaLight sheep into Ran

Ryker's reads make sense

Page 34:

Adumbro makes sense

Yeah that's about it

Ryker's entrace was bad but not for the reasons that Mulch pointed out.  The questions read as an attempt to derpclear himself, not gain town cred.  He's obviously played mafia before so those questions just read really hollow.

Zulfy: Nullscum. Not a huge fan of how he's been so set on Mulch and yet refused to back up his reasoning with an example when Mulch asked him to. Sticking to throwing shade without supporting it (""No, feel free to discredit that point as much as you want"") is not good.

Also, another one of his points on Mulch looks pretty bad in retrospect. When Mulch says that overdefensiveness is NAI and ends up acting defensive, Zulfy arbitrarily creates a connection here without considering that it would still be consistent for him as town trying to play to his wincon by not getting lynched. It especially pings me because Mulch's stance on this seems pretty obviously like a belief that he holds regardless of alignment (which should make it NAI if nothing else), so him trying to paint it as scummy looks forced.

Tammy- Null. Nothing AI yet.

Mulch- I struggled with this slot for a while and Iâ€™m going to put him as a tentative townlean. Still feel like there are some NAI things he looked like he was pushing for the sake of pushing (the Ryker/Transcend cases), but the illogical response to people townreading him actually seems more good than bad on reread, because itâ€™s difficult to imagine scum!Mulch being that paranoid and instantly distrusting anyone who townreads him when heâ€™s already in somewhat of a negative spotlight. He could have easily coasted on the trust he was gaining and he essentially ran in the opposite direction. I also like how heâ€™s openly pressured people to give opinions on him, shows a desire for transparency.

FrozenFlame- Townlean, if only because of 865. Here he shows a unique and considerably hard to fake way of reaction baiting by claiming to have been purposely antagonistic to try to throw Gamma off. The effectiveness of this is debatable, but it makes perfect sense in regards to his earlier â€œscumreadâ€� and shows a level of inventive scumhunting that looks genuine. Most of his other posts are null at worst when I consider that he started out trying to help apply pressure before committing to anything.

@Frozen, the thing Iâ€™d wanted an answer for was this, although itâ€™s not really relevant anymore for reasons I just explained:



For those I canâ€™t go into detail for yet: Ranmaru and (to a lesser extent) Ryker are probably town. LaLight is currently my top suspect. Nullscum on marshy. Other slots are either null or still being worked out.",71796,2017-05-17 22:08:00,1123

I've yet to see scum that encourages discussion as much as you do Ranmaru.  You prod at everyone and are looking to see if reads are legit.  At some point i'll have to check you you havn't done that to and see if there is a pattern, but thats probably after flips.",71796,2017-05-18 13:36:00,1230

1246,Ranmaru,"Reason being, I think I find more scum intent within Lalight than FireScream or Zulfy. Starting with his original stance on Agent Sparkles, showing that he cared more to rush a stance while not properly read up. I also agree with Ryker that his stance on Agent Sparkles is concerning, and his openness to joining me was surprising. I also dislike that he is putting extra emphasis on trusting me, it feels like he is trying to link himself to me since that is all he can do as his position crumbles, especially as he describes himself as a player who finds it hard to trust anyone but himself, which is a natural stance to take as a newbie. (For example, after J broke my heart and was scum, I found it hard to trust other players)

Fire Scream also seems to have had a lack of motivation but he is here trying. So I have him as much lower priority now.",71796,2017-05-18 13:50:00,1236

Bolded literally made me lol



Gamma wagon sounds pretty hype to me rn

 

Oh trust me I absolutely believed it when I said Gamma was being pretentious. Granted, it was ambiguous whether or not he was being deliberately pretentious but I just decided to accuse him anyway. I totally meant it. I just wasn't 100% sure if I was reading his intent correctly.



It's probably because I've been deliberately antagonistic and shitposty. So hatred for my playstyle isn't particularly unwarranted or unexpected


                    

Nothing anybody says would make you change your tactics eh? Nothing? Ever? You'll have to forgive me for not believing that for a minute lmao

1118 and 1120 in response to Transcend calling Tammy scummy are just gross af. Very oversensitive/defensive to even the slightest questioning of her towniness. I mean just read these two posts and tell me your gut isn't wrenching 



Speaking of Transcend, I completely forgot to include him in my reads list. He sits on the high end of neutral non-plays, bordering on town-lean. Didn't like the slot as much early on but hes been growing on me. I actually feel almost the same way about Ryker. Ryker probably doesn't deserve to be a full town read for me at this point but he hasn't been pinging for me lately so I'll let it sit",71796,2017-05-18 15:32:00,1244

When I first read it, it looked like you trying to act like you didn't know much about mafia, which you clearly did as you mentioned rqs hatred.  However, after getting further and seeing that you obviously have played with people here and they're vouching for you having a style, you can't have been trying to act like you didn't know how mafia works.  They still seem like silly questions to me, but right now I have a theory you play on a site that mafia kills are handled differently than every other site I've played on, so the questions themselves might not have anything to do with anything.",71796,2017-05-18 17:18:00,1246

It was gross.



It's very unenjoyable.  I literally considered replacing out last night, and still am, when I caught up to where I did because I'm not in the mood to deal with unenjoyable play styles right now.



Nope!  I'm a pretty stubborn person with a set play style.  The only tactics I've ever changed is that I used to be very aggressive as town because I thought that's how people were supposed to be, but people always thought I was being condescending and rude so I changed that aspect of my play style and settled into what it is today.",71796,2017-05-18 17:18:00,1247
1258,Tammy,"

I don't think you know what over defensive or oversensitive actually mean, especially to place the very in front of it.  I am an oversensitive and defensive person, but neither of those response are that.

I am also quite self-absorbed, and I do find it humorous when I get the oh Tammy's scum when I'm getting into the game as town.  I do like people to talk about their read on me because it helps me read them.

And considering that I was very amused by it, no sorry not your interpretation.",71796,2017-05-18 17:21:00,1248

Well I sheeped his vote, and I guess I technically still am considering I followed him onto the AS wagon. But I'm certainly not 100% sheeping Ran on all my reads. Not sure what you're getting at here



This is a really bizarre theory. What are you even getting at? Are you saying you think he's used to playing games where flips are handled differently or are you actually referring to the way NKs are resolved relative to other abilities during night phase? Really curious about the relevancy of these potential differences in ""ways in which mafia kills are handled"" as it relates to liking/disliking RQS.



What was? Me saying that Gamma was being arguably pretentious with his comment? I mean do you legitimately believe that there is no way that his comments to ryker re: including himself in his reads list could be interpreted as pretentious and condescending? I kind of explained it here already:



So is it gross because you don't agree that my interpretation is a plausible one? Or because you just don't like that I called him pretentious? Because if its the former you're being thick and if its the latter you're being oversensitive.



Ok yeah so you're definitely oversens....



Well that settles that.



Mmmmm yes, classic positive ad hom. ""I'm an Xish person therefore I am an authority on Xishness and know what it means for something to be Xish better than you do."" That's some quality argument right there   

That shitty argument goes the other way anyway btw. If you're such an oversensitive/defensive person, your standard for ""ordinary"" sensitivity/defensiveness is likely to be skewed toward higher degrees of sensitivity/defensiveness relative to a person who does not have oversensitivity/defensiveness as character traits. If we accept shitty ad hom logic, we can just as easily disqualify your ability to assess oversensitivity/defensiveness by virtue of your own bias due to being more likely to express those traits. Your propensity to express them makes you a poor judge for objectively identifying when they are presenting in the average individual, because what is ""mild"" or ""ordinary"" to you is likely extreme to the average individual.

Not that I actually care to assess your capacity for objectively assessing one's oversensitivity/defensiveness. Just pointing out how lame your ad hom is.",71796,2017-05-18 18:56:00,1255
1266,Tammy,"Saying you don't know the meaning of a word is not ad hon please stop throwing around words while not understanding the meaning.

Yes I'm assuming ryker has experience with different handling of night kills.  It has nothing to do with rqs.  The fact that he knew what rqs was and hates it demonstrates experience in mafia while the questions do not.  I thought he was going for a fake derp clear due to new mess.",71796,2017-05-18 19:01:00,1256

1270,FrozenFlame,"

But seriously don't replace out because of me, just NK me tonight if you're sick of my asshattery, I won't take it personally  



Man you really do like to be baseless condescending

It's absolutely ad hom to assert that I don't know what oversensitive/defensive mean when you then ground it with the implied argument ""I on the otherhand do in fact know what they mean and have the authority to determine that you don't know what they mean because I am an oversensitive/defensive person."" Maybe if you had actually explained how my use of the terms didn't fit the definition explicitly you could have had a non ad hom basis for asserting I don't understand those terms. But you didn't do that, and instead used shitty ad hom to give yourself credibility as an assessor of who does/doesn't know what oversensitive/defensive means so you could sound right when you say that I don't know what they mean instead of actually explaining how I used the terms wrong.

So please stop saying I don't know what things mean like a condescending fuck when you a.) haven't offered any substantive reasoning that illustrates my alleged lack of understanding and b.) are so poorly versed in the broad scope of the family of ad hominem fallacies that you literally failed to recognize your own commission of such a fallacy and tried misrepresenting what you actually said to make it seem like you didn't explicitly base your entire argument of my alleged ignorance on the predicate inference ""I'm oversensitive/defensive so I know what those are, and thus rule that you FF do not know what they mean.""

Yeah probably not helping the case for you not replacing out but hey nothing gets me going like people who clearly don't understand fallacies claiming that I don't understand fallacies",71796,2017-05-18 19:23:00,1260

Saying someone doesn't know what a word means is not condescending or ad hom, people throw around buzz words they misapply or use incorrectly all the time.  It's saying you don't know what the word means if you're making the claim something was what it was not.

I'm very well aware of when I'm even feeling defensive, maybe a little bit right now, and my interaction with transcend was not even close.  I was amused.  It's a rare game that someone doesn't think I'm scum early game when I'm catching up,and I thoight it was funny.  I was being playful with transcend, I don't typically refer to a silly pop song when I'm defensive, but I did want to interact with transcend to get a feel for him but he declined.  I have limited experience with transcend, but in the two games we've played what I have noticed about him is he has decent instincts and while he responds in the moment he has deeper thoight about stuff.

""Believing that overdefensiveness is NAI lets you yourself act overdefensive and have an ideological base for not being self-conscious about that and also allows you to ignore any potential scumbuddies that would be acting that way."".

This makes sort of sense in a twisted way but...it's wrong fully.  And I think this player should be experienced enough to know that this is meta over anything.



??? What does this have to do about OTHERS?



?



Self meta is fine but this does not address my complaint, which is actually ironically similar to one thing she said origianlly!!



???????????????????????

455 and 456, the ones ranmaru picked out, are strange ones to pick out from that whole thing.




Sparkles doesn't challenge the weird bit about playing with his emotions and not using logic
doesn't protest that he's been busy/unmotivated

And on another note, thinks that a net zero and null are completely different concepts.

1361,Agent Sparkles,"More of my thoughts:

Gamma Emerald- Finding it really difficult to read this slot. My only ping from him was a false alarm in retrospect and nothing else is really standing out, but Iâ€™d probably put him at nulltown for his earlier pressure on marshy and fairly natural-looking progression. His reads are generally vague and hard to make conclusions from, which is probably NAI.

Marshy- Probably the scummiest in the game (besides maybe LaLight) on reconsideration. Up until about page 20, he basically coasted on naked bandwagon votes without pressuring/scumhunting or giving any opinions. After that, he apparently still finds me and Zulfy suspicious but won't go into either of those, even after being repeatedly pressured to explain his Zulfy vote.

Then look at posts 959, 961, and 988. The individual posts are alarming, the progression is worse. He theorizes that at least 2 and maybe 3 scum are off of the leading wagons, then immediately shows a level of confidence of at least one of us being scum that heâ€™s willing to lynch without a claim if one of us flips town (which is really awful and anti-town in itself) and call Gammaâ€™s opinion on both of us being town â€œutterly insaneâ€� and suggest he could be scum for it. And Marshyâ€™s â€œmost of these votes are awfulâ€� comment in 959 looks even worse when considering that his own votes on both slots had nothing visible behind them at all. And wanting to cut the day really short with the leading wagon on an inactive player (like he suggested) is deliberately hurtful to town even if they're right.

Ranmaru: My strongest townlean right now. His ISO is bleeding with the desire to sort people and  advance the game. Pressuring multiple people to contribute and be transparent, trying to dig deep into peopleâ€™s thought processes and understand them, and showing some evidence of deliberately doing extra research to read people. I wouldn't bet the game on it, but I feel pretty safe townreading him.

LaLight: Scum. 652 and 660 both look fake. He supposedly scumreads Mulch and Ryker for a lot of empty posting early on, which is highly inaccurate and really looks like itâ€™s just for show. Ryker and Mulch (especially the latter) were both important contributors, as anyone whoâ€™s been reading their posts should know, and he calls them out on it but not posters like Transcend or Marshy? Then he takes 476 (which is completely NAI, by the way) and tries to make it about Ryker distracting attention from other players even though that has absolutely nothing to do with the post and everything else Ryker had done was about other slots. Heâ€™s coming up with reasons to suspect people that donâ€™t exist. I acknowledge the explanation in the bottom paragraph, but he was using things that werenâ€™t even valid in the first place, not just exaggerating them.

660 is scummy for reasons already explained. Iâ€™d expect town to address the reasoning behind the wagon (which he does, to an extent), but not to discredit and throw AtE attacks at the wagon solely on the basis of it being an easy wagon even if there are good reasons behind it (which he even admits himself that there are). Meaningless shade, not genuine thought.

Later, his vote on me is partially because he â€œreally trusts Ranmaru?â€� Awfully convenient sheep vote for someone who never has townreads. Agree with Ryker that his argument of â€œlogic and consistencyâ€� is shallow and could easily be applied to multiple people in this thread.

Anyway, I have more to say but Iâ€™m leaving to stay at a hotel for the night. I know Iâ€™m torturing some of you but I will definitely be fully caught up and updated on everything this weekend. I don't really want to replace out over temporary time issues.

My view of LaLight is somewhat similar to Mulch except without the really big newb tells.  LaLight seems to have ideas about games she's picked up from not many games at all and doesn't really understand how they're used or applied.  This was especially evident in the AtE discussion.

The actual reads and thoughts on players are pretty bad, most notably the you and FS distancing by that one post you made, but it was also accompanied by advice for how to properly distance, which felt a little honest.

I don't think I've agreed with any thoughts she's given so far, but right now I'm leaning just a little green maybe and is finding her way in the game.",71796,2017-05-19 23:49:00,1369

1382,Tammy,"Okay I am ""caught up"" meaning I have skimmed the game to try to get current.  I have not read every post deeply nor do I have grand reasons behind any of my reads.  I don't really like playing the game this way, but I am a super slow reader and I'd probably still be on page 20 if I went my normal way.  What I'm hoping right now is that my gut reads based on skimming aren't too far from accurate and that from this point on I should play my normal style.  Though the last time I played a game just skimming a good number of my reads were on point, so maybe that's what's going on here.

lalight and mulch are two players I'm probably giving too much of a newb pass (and sorry I don't care if you have a few games under your belt, you've both been playing less than a year by your join date and by some of your reasoning that you're very new.  It's not a bad thing, we all had to start somewhere!)  I'd be really super surprised if Mulch wasn't just town though, while the juries out on lalight in that I don't like her reasons for things at all, but I want to see more as it's not out of the realm of possibility it's just town.  I do think that both of these players are very easy for scum to attack though which is one of the main things I haven't liked about zulfy or early sparkles.  Those are just surface level reads and arguments.

I'm not a fan of a lot of firescreamer's posts, especially those page by page posts, but I have liked some of his indignation?

I'm softening a bit there.  I've liked a deal of what I've seen of Adum's posts and I thought his meta interpretation on Ryker was interesting and Ran didn't contradict him and seems to have him leaning town as well.  Therefore I'm taking those into account, and I can see Ryker playing in the way that he described.  I can deal with a bravado play style once I know that it's just play style, and several people have vouched for that, so the fakeness I thought I saw earlier can be accounted for.

So well this is logical lol.  I think that the point on Marshy, and the progression, is really valid because I think scum have a huge tendency to do pre flip analysis, and saying ""at least one scum..."" etc on something is setting it up to shade the others if there ARENT or clear others if they are

It's right here. He used to scumread Zulfy but then Marshy's anti-town play scared him off of it. It's extremely mechanical, he's really triggered by Marshy continuing to ignore the question.

My opinion on Sparkles or the people voting Sparkles? I've given the former repeatedly.

The latter, uhhhhhhhhhhh, I haven't paid too much attention to who's on which wagon at this stage. I mostly just care about getting my lynch and seeing a flip. Lemme look.

...

Oh Christ, it's Lalight, FF, Transcend. That's not company I'd want to bet the game on.

FF I waffle on. I liked his introduction. I like some of his observations, but I feel like I just don't have enough pieces to get a good picture of what's going on in his head and that is terrifying to me. I just want him to post more so I can evaluate the slot.

Transcend is a pain. He doesn't do much. His push to consolidate and get rid of the ""vanity wagons"" is correct, but it's also playing armchair mafia critic which is the easiest way to sit there and do nothing. I can't recall his reasoning for his stances, even if I don't think them too egregious. He's Marshy light, which is annoying, but he's around more often. Most of the time when he's posting, I'm rolling my eyes and skimming.

Lalight, obvscum. Please kill it.",71796,2017-05-20 09:14:00,1421
1432,Ryker,"On the subject of Sparkles though, in looking for that vote count, I noticed that I was wrong and #1351 is not an Adum post, as I had originally believed. That is a legitimately good post. The Gamma Emerald, Ranmaru, and Lalight reads mirror my own with similar reasoning. The Marshy read lacks the context mine has from years of playing with the player, so I don't have a problem with that read either.

If the slot keeps putting those out, that's a good slot, imo. Remove him from my lynchpool.

Want to hit Lalight, will settle for Zulfy.

Will not lynch Ran, Mulch, Gamma, Sparkles, Adum, or Tammy unless further information is brought to my attention.

I do agree that there I could be giving a newb pass where I shouldn't be, and it's not so much of a pass as it's I want to see more.  I hate almost everything they've posted, and probably wouldn't be second guessing right now if they weren't new because their posts are just that bad.  Probably wouldn't lose any tears if they were town and mislynched though.

Posts like this:



The bolded shit is the kind of thing scum say when they're trying to sound protown and authoritative.

I hate all the reads she's given and why.



This leaves me scratching my head a bit because I've thought she has a somewhat wooden tone which is somewhat unusual for an emotional person.  The first time I felt that she felt something was when discussing how offended she was by you.  This concerns me because people have a hard time injecting natural emotion into their posting when scum and it comes off flat.  Her tone starts sounding more natural as things go on.

However this:

This


Is the PERFECT example of distancing. I mean well, you have a lot of people to analyze, do you say they're all townie so you look into someone else to analyze? No one does that. Make a case and advance it, this post above doesn't do anything other than distracting attention to the player.

And it doesn't matter that that player reacted scummily. You can both be scum.


D1 from my experience is a little worse than D2 but still the best time to distance yourself from your partners. I still can't believe it was that easy in 1903, when I made like 5 posts about how rb is scummy, he's made couple of posts about how I am scummy, I made a post like ""who's creature"" (Creature, rb, me were scumbuddies) and in the end it all worked out. I am saying, you should never say things like Zulfy vs Mulch because they may try to distance each other. But time and flips will tell.

Now I am perfectly comfortable with VOTE: Ryker and I think you all should be too.[/quote]

is so adorable.  Like that's not even good distancing in the first place and is such an innocuous post.  I mean sure it could be, but it does look like she thought she picked something up.  She then gives advice about what you should say and what good distancing is.  That's the kind of thing that has me going eh maybe these little scum tells are just really newb tells.

And how much do I want to believe that newbscum is going to go after the strongest presence in the game?  I kinda like that ""I think you all should be too"" touch.  (If I have some time, I'll look to see if she is just brazen newb scum, but I'm not confident with her current posting.)



I don't really know why because what's said isn't alignment indicative, but I just really liked this post.  It makes me feel like she's just really in that weird early learning process with how to play and what to do and that could be coloring her posting.

Ah yeah, that was my thought in the first 14 pages of the game because I liked your town read on mulch.  That conformed to the thing that I thought I learned about you in Kids TV Show in which you can pick up on the little town tells that people are dropping even as a good number of people are attacking them.

I thought he spent more time than was necessary on the mulch attack at the beginning and it looked like him trying to make mulch look bad rather than understand him.  I didn't like the move onto gamma for the reasons he did nor did I like the reasoning for the lalight attack.  All of it looked like trying to jump at something easy.  Also something just really rubbed me the wrong way about how he defended the rqs thing at the beginning.  His last couple posts where he gives reads are okay, but I'll need to see some more from him interaction wise to see if maybe the reads and such weren't just damage control.",71796,2017-05-20 16:15:00,1479

Associating players bases on what you think of other players lets you better formulate a view of how the game looks. In addition, noting pre-flip aasociations GETS YOUR OPINION OUT BEFORE THE NEXT DAY. This is a huge benefit in case you're night killed.

Reads.   

Transcend:  Spoiler:  Firstly, you came under a lot of pressure day 1.  I don't like how calm you acted.  Yeah, it's meta, but I think that you acted SO much that you didn't care it's almost like you were TRYING to not care.  I don't like how you keep doing pre flip associations.  You don't explain anything you do but I think that is your meta.  You townread me immediately after I scumread you, which scum have done in the past, and is a warning flag.   You use self meta, but this is again something according to your meta.   You came off scummy very near here too with your pre flip associations.  I also don't like the sheer amount of fluff you have.  

Some town posts:   263  590  944 1460  669

Some scum posts:   1503 1499 322 270 161 

Funny post for someone who wants a laugh:  1327

Overall read:  Posts and overall tone lead you as lean-mid scum, with it being even higher if the fluffyness wasn't apparently part of your meta.

Marshy:

Spoiler:  I liked how you scumread me in the beginning and sort of naturally transitioned into not scumread me as much.  YOu had a good flow to it, and your logic seemed clear.  You  seem to have a lot of posts that don't do that much stuff but act like they are, though, and ask a lot of questions.  You do pre flip associations with me and Wulfy, which I really don't like.  You did that scummy thing telling the vig who to shoot.  You also do pre flip and wagon pre flip analysis which is extremely scummy.  Good catch on Gamma.  So much fluff.  Jokes.  So much jokes.

1635,Agent Sparkles,"VOTE: Transcend

You think maybe I didn't move my vote from marshy because we still had 4 days to consolidate? That hammer on Zulfy was straight-up awful. For the vast majority of the day you want to lynch me, but when Ryker puts him at L-1 you immediately hammer him without letting him claim? I was still a very plausible lynch target yesterday, and for someone who thinks I've ""scumclaimed in every post"" the way you hopped off was disgusting.

Marshy, yesterday you said you should speedlynch me without a claim today if Zulfy flipped town, but you just went and started a FireScreamer wagon at dawn without even mentioning me once. Yet another disconnect.

So this is what I was getting ready to post when I saw it was night:

Spoiler:  @Gamma- I have analyzed your content and I acknowledge that thereâ€™s a lot of it, but it was consistently underwhelming in the sense that there was nothing I really felt like I should be promoting or attacking you for, especially with how vague most of your cases have been. Your accusation/assumption of me â€œnot really analyzing youâ€� is gross, especially when youâ€™ve had me as a nullread for so long.

And about LaLight, I donâ€™t scumread him just because he AtEâ€™d or threw shade like youâ€™ve implied. Both of those things can be NAI depending on circumstances, especially if the person has a meta of it. My problem with it was how AtE and empty shade were the basis of his attack against his wagon. He tried hard to discredit self-admittedly reasonable votes on him simply by labeling himself as an easy target and trying to make them feel bad about it without any decent points about why the wagon was actually bad. Unless you were saying that he has a history of doing this exact thing as town, which I highly doubt you were.

Ranmaru, Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re asking me to explain myself regarding the case on me in general? Iâ€™ll just go through the points against me in that case:

The activity/follow-up: You said yourself that activity is NAI for me. Iâ€™ve replaced out as town before because catching up with the game combined with everything else I had to deal with was overwhelming and having not been present at the beginning made it hard to read people. The lack of follow-up is a byproduct of this, as most of my posts excluding the stretch at the beginning have been selecting things to address in the time that I had. I do care about solving the game, but right now is kind of a difficult time to do it, mostly because itâ€™s the last few weeks of my sophomore year. Lynch me if this hasnâ€™t changed by Day 2, since IRL should be a lot more convenient.

The jump on Gamma: First of all, attacking me for â€œThis feels rightâ€� or saying Iâ€™m contradicting my anti-gut meta is ridiculous, because I explained my logic for it in the post afterward. I realize now that it wasnâ€™t a good reason to suspect him, but at the time I saw his posts and went â€œwhy is he making conclusions off of things that he isnâ€™t even really looking at?â€� There was maybe one +1 point that Zulfy didnâ€™t go into, which made Gammaâ€™s assessment look really fake until I changed my view from â€œdoes this make sense as townâ€� to â€œis there actual scum motivation behind this?â€� And I donâ€™t get Ranmaruâ€™s point about suspecting Gamma out of emotion instead of reason. There wasnâ€™t a single post in that push that came from a â€œhey, I dislike this so letâ€™s push itâ€� mindset.

My posts appearing designed for towncred: I donâ€™t really know how to disprove this, Iâ€™m just telling things the way I see them. A little more elaboration on this would help (since it seems to extend beyond the follow-up argument).

The RQS thing: Yeah, I donâ€™t know why this is even a point at all. Gamma brought it up and I saw no reason why it should hinder us, so I went along with it and questioned those who slammed the idea right off the bat.

It looks like LaLight and Zulfy are more likely lynch candidates right now, but Iâ€™d still lynch Marshy if people are up for it. His recent posts have not impressed me and he really needs to justify the points that Iâ€™ve brought up against him, especially the extremely fake progression.

In the meantime, @Mulch, what do you think of my points against LaLight? The supposedly towny posts you pointed out were the same ones that pinged me, and I donâ€™t think (s)he brought up any good points against Ryker at all. At best they can pretty much be knocked down by looking at Rykerâ€™s ISO.

Iâ€™m not interested in voting {Ranmaru, Ryker, FrozenFlame, Mulch} today. I would vastly prefer to lynch one of Light and Marshy, maybe compromise on Zulfy or Deus. Anyone else would need a good case.",71796,2017-05-24 11:58:00,1625

Agreed, completely shocked Ran wasn't the NK



^^^ so much this



This lynchpool fucking speaks to me. Do you have noted associations among them that tie them together as a team or are these just your top 3 picks?



Ok so you're right that the hammer was questionable af but dude this post reads like extremely forced/fake outrage

So generally I think FireScreamer is like the only person in this game who had motive to kill adum considering adum had a hard on for grilling FS but that's almost too obvious. I could also see marshy/ryker/Ran encouraging an adum NK just because of marshy's comments above re: how difficult it can be to lynch him. Will need to ISO adum though to see if anyone else may have had strong motive

Generally just not a fan of how that zulfy wagon gained momentum so quickly which Agent Sparkles wagon literally stalled at 4 for fucking ever. People have been saying bussing is site meta but my gut tells me scum weren't exactly jumping at the AS wagon for whatever reason. Zulfy wagon just seemed like a very easy out to avoid getting on what was before then the most popular wagon. Gonna get back on that for now

I'd probably give gamma and Lalight a hard look if you flipped town but really I need to take a look at how your wagon evolved yesterday. And no, my vote on you isn't at all based on associations, thats why I'm asking transcend to elaborate on his lynchpool because if he's picking up on associations Im missing I want to hear about them. My vote on you is entirely based on the fact that I find it extremely sketchy that your wagon stalled so hard when frankly I don't think anyone was really articulating any strong reasoning as to why you ought be townread/not wagonned, which makes me feel like town players were just feeling apathetic about the wagon and scum used that apathy as an excuse to not bus and wait for something else to catch on. That and the fact that I think Ran made some good points re: you not really caring to follow up and drill down on the people you were pressing D1. But yeah its mostly the fact that your wagon hit a brick wall absent any concrete opposition to your lynch, while Zulfy's wagon super turbo'd with almost no effort whatsoever. I didn't see your slot as being particularly distinguishable from Zulfy as far as being a play is concerned, so yeah, that very clear difference in how your wagons were handled I find unsettling.



I think you're reading into what I'm saying a little too much. I'm not at all suggesting that merely by virtue of the adum NK that suddenly you/Ran/ryker are plays. Not even close. I was just spitballing here and saying what potential motives immediately came to mind upon seeing the flip. Again, adum is a weird as fuck NK target and I was articulating some simple explanations that came to mind. Not really sure why me mentioning that you/Ran/ryker might have motive to kill adum based on meta is so offensively bad to you. I wasn't at all saying we should be looking at you three as top plays. Far from it.

I guess if you felt that I was trying to be sneaky here and subtly throw shade at you just based on this NK motive argument I can get why you're having such a severe reaction but damn man I'm a bit surprised you reacted this way",71796,2017-05-24 14:33:00,1632

Maybe it had something to do with how Ryker had asked for a claim literally 5 minutes earlier? Stagnation isn't an excuse when you aren't leaving any time for things to happen. You could've easily lynched a cop.

And adding to what Ranmaru said in 1654, you're apparently confident enough in me being scum to center the gamestate around it, but you suddenly dropped all ambition to lynch me as soon as there was an L-1. You went ""sparkles is a scumfuck"" ---> lazily hammering Zulfy ---> basically treating me like a confscum slot. While you're at it, why are you so confident in that read in the first place?

@Marshy- You should at least be able to explain how your opinion on me and Zulfy changed so dramatically for no apparent reason. Your progression was basically:

1: At least 2 scum, maybe all 3 of them are probably off of Sparkles and Zulfy.
2: If one of them is town, the other one is scum and we need to lynch them without a claim.
3: Gamma saying both of them could be town is insane, and he could be scum if they somehow are.

It's ironic that this is your reaction to Ranmaru finding and pushing a scumread in a game about finding and pushing scumreads. Why not try to show why you're town or push someone better instead of complaining about it?



Personally, I don't think it's changed much. They have the same generally passive approach and irrational response to being scumread. Maybe the sarcastic comment toward Transcend was a bit odd, but outside of that....

Do you think it's possible he just...got annoyed at you scumreading him this day?  Another possibility is that there actually IS no reason for his tone change and it literally is just because he is in a worse or different mood than when you scumread him day 1

In terms of scum motivation... I can see it.  He could have talked in the mafiachat and thought to try and have a plan to shake off a scumread by you.  But the other thing is that do you think scum would be so obvious to basically tell YOU, the highest townread in the game, to go basically fuck off with scumreading him?

I buy LaLight's claim. ScumLight gains nothing from sticking his neck out like that just to town confirm marshy. There isn't even anything approaching serious momentum for a marshy wagon today, nor should there be. Why blow a big fakeclaim when under barely any pressure to clear a slot that frankly no one has strong opinions about? The whole having to wait until N3 for another investigation being motivation for claiming now makes perfect sense to me given LaLight's articulated fear that he may not live that long. Plenty of folks, myself included, have been tossing around LaLight as a preferred play so I think his claim comes from a place of town motivation i.e. he wants to reduce confusion and allow people to focus their attention more fruitfully, and of course provide the town with a nice clear on a hard to read slot.

I think the arguments re: whether a cop ought investigate null slots or top scum slots is debateable and kind of a wash. Investigate nulls and you get info on slots that will be the hardest to read later due to lack of associations with the people who flip early, at the risk of missing important early game clears/guilties to secure early game scum lynches/avoid early town mislynches. Investigate top scum reads early to avoid early mislynches and correct poor groupthinky scumreads, or confirm them for easy early game town advantage and of course the ever crucial scum flip, at the risk that you let those null reads remain null and become nasty question marks in the late game.

Either way, whether or not I think LaLight was strategically optimal in choosing marshy is kind of irrelevant. Point is it makes sense given his order of operations in sheeping marshy and then basically saying lol fuck it and just spilling the beans.



Uhhhhh what? Why in the world would a cop want to be a huge obnoxious presence like mulch was early on? If you draw that much attention to yourself you're likely to be either heavily scum read or heavily town read by a decent chunk of the game. Lots of townreads gets a bullet which is horrible cop play. Lots of scumreads puts you on lynch lineup which might force you to claim early which is horrible cop play. Being questionable enough to not eat an NK but also townie enough to avoid lynch pressure is the sweetspot big PRs really ought to shoot for. Im not saying that LaLight hit that sweetspot, but how the fuck do you think mulch is emblematic of ""expected"" cop play? I couldn't disagree more here. Drawing attention to oneself like mulch did so early in the game is antithetical to the play a strong town PR should exhibit IMO.

Transcend has been on an upward trend IMO all game and him sticking his neck out to confirm a slot like LaLight only continues that. Ignoring the actual circumstances of how this claim played out, I think anyone would recognize that LaLight's slot wouldn't necessarily be believe at face value. For example, if we were wagonning LaLight right now and then he made this claim to save his ass, I doubt it would be received all that well. LaLight & Transcend being scum together doing a joint claim and support gambit is outrageously risky and doesn't make any sense for them to try to pull at this point in the game. And frankly, if Transcend and Lalight are scum pulling this stunt, why would Transcend offer such a vague confirmation? ""I have reason to believe that he's actually an Odd night X"" really to me makes a pretty clear suggestion about what's in Transcend's role PM, but it's still not offering much. Whereas had transcend really wanted to, he could have claimed something more powerful along the lines of tracker/reporter to say ""Hey, LaLight actually did a thing last night, can confirm."" I mean by claiming he has indicative info in his role PM, he's already claiming to be non VT, so why not go all the way if you're trying to pull a mega gambit?

Point is, I don't see scumTranscend and scumLaLight working together here. Willing to trust both of their claims. And I just really like Transcends lynch pool. Firescreamer can go for having obvious D1 interaction derivative motive to kill adum, Agent Sparkles for having a massively sketchy wagon stall followed by an almost effortless stampeding of Zulfy, and Gamma just because my gut hasn't like that slot all game and his play hasn't really done anything to assuage it. Down to start with FireScreamer though, as I agree with Transcend that he and FireScreamer were to two grossest votes on Zulfy. Speaking of which, I respect transcend's self awareness on that front but am also sympathetic to his impatience and wanting to end the day for some flips. Frankly I was feeling the same itch D1 which is why I was so irked by the fact that the AS wagon was going no where, a wagon which I felt actually had some merit and would have produced a much more useful flip.

Also Firescreamer and AS posting ""I'll post something meaningful later"" posts and not even reacting to Lalight's claim and Transcend's support of it is mind boggling to me. I have plenty of re-reading to do, namely going through adum's post and all of my top scum reads to crystallize those, but none of that is necessary to interact with recent developments meaningfully. Just feels stally, like they're taking their time to deliberate how to interact with such a potent claim.

1873,FrozenFlame,"

A better suggestion for what? I'm legitimately confused as to what you're asking of me here. Like are you asking me to fully articulate what I think optimal cop play is? Because I already sort of did that when I described the ""sweet spot"" above. Or are you asking me to explain whether or not I feel LaLight's conduct this game, outside of the claim itself  and derivative discussion, fits that of a cop?

I'm mid ISO for adum and this little exchange caught my eye:

























Basically I think this whole back and forth between FireScreamer and adum, which some Gamma commentary included, is the most pressure FireScreamer has felt all game. Pretty illustrative of his general reluctance to induce clarity underpressure and instead his instinct to try to flip the situation and place the onus on adum to figure out his (FireScreamers) motives. Pretty shady IMO.

The Gamma interactions peppered in there feel really gross to me, but it almost feels too obvious. My gut tells me Gamma is serving FireScreamer up softballs re: defending his vanity voting, but goddamn that is some obvious buddying for scum buddies. I mean FS even asks Gamma to ""vouch"" for his playstyle at one point. That's ballsy as fuck buddying IMO. And of course there's this little gem:



Like what the fuck kind of message is this supposed to send other than ""lol I'm gonna soft comment on TRing Gamma but lightheartedly acknowledge I might be wrong teehee""

All this just makes a FireScreamer flip more valuable IMO, especially if he's scum. Part of me is saying there's no way scum buddy this obviously when one is under pressure from one fucking slot and thats it, but another part of me wants to believe that FS really was irked by the pressure and leaned on a scummate who happened to be active in the thread to shake it.

Whatever though, what's done is done and this doesn't change my TR on you.



Well I don't really have too much more to add. Basically I think optimal cop play is you want to be present enough to 1.) Not get unnecessary heat for lurking  and 2.) not get read by the scum as hiding in the shadows and thus likely have a PR. You probably shouldn't be spearheading wagons early on because if you're nailing scum with your reads you're asking for a bullet, so I think it's best to play support on wagons you find to have merit but being the leading voice is generally a bad idea IMO. Makes you seem non threatening to scummies. But of course there's no universal best set of tactics for any PR, this is just my take on it in a vacuum. And obviously the longer you live in the game the less relevant all of this becomes. IMO the cops goal should be to live atleast 2 day phases and get a guilty which you claim pretty much asap unless you are in a position to spearhead a wagon on the guilty without having to claim, or get 2 town clears on players that are likely to survive to late in the game since if you targets get lynched/NK'd those investigations are wasted. Hopefully that answers your question.

 So are you saying you automatically take on the first town PR to die? In my experience the backup usually gets to choose to take on the role of any dead townie on any given night in the game. Basically promotes meaningful choices re: risk reward of either taking the first PR you see for maximum use value vs. playing wait and see to potentially give an amazing PR second life.

1952,FrozenFlame,"I hear you re: Gamma/Fire being targets that are easy to lynch but I guess I see the dayvig's utility as more being the ability to get an instant flip that DOESN'T end the day, therefore allowing for combo setups. Like getting to confirm FS scum via dayvig flip would put us in a great position to pivot off of that scum flip for another hit today. There is definitely merit to wanting to see the FS wagon play out though and see who ultimately commits to closing it out.

Not trying to start and argument though, I'm not saying AS was a bad shot. Just would've preferred to have Gamma flip because its a nagging gut read of mine and FS for validation/repudiation of adums read + connections to other slots. Ultimately its just preference though, can't fault you for shooting someone you've consistently been scum reading since early D1, especially after the wagon stall which I mentioned multiple times was frustrating to me. I'm sure that sentiment only applies moreso to you lol

and yes Ran I'm referring to xkcd game when I say it wasn't my idea for massclaim this time

funnily enough massclaiming is what allowed us to pin marshy as SK in that game but unfortunately for me and the rest of the town, lynching the SK caused us to get endgamed. Some mafiats had better fake claims than others, but marshy's was clearly the obviously anti town. Idk if you read the whole thing but SDK's claim was extremely strong, I got super played there. Jimbob's roleblocker claim was shit and though I distrusted it I should've come down harder on it... but yeah slightly different scenario there as well as the game guaranteed that every slot had a PR so in that scenario I knew everyone would have to commit to something.

1960,FrozenFlame,"It's not inconceivable that there could be a scum backup role that operates more the the backup role I described earlier where the power isn't automatic and just allows the player to pick up any one dead player's powers. Could be useful for scum to pick up a number of different town roles, if only to be able to use it as a fake claim. But picking up tracker/watcher/report/voyeur/cop could be useful for spreading disinformation by faking results. Doctor is useful for protecting buddies against SK crossfire/vig shots. Jailer for same reasons plus ability to just RB people while claiming to be protecting. Plenty of conceivable reasons why a backup could be a useful scum role.

The automatic nature of tammy's claim makes it trickier to balance as a scum role because there are some roles that just don't really benefit the scum to use at all, just neighborizer. I mean frankly, if tammy is scum, picks up neighborizer, and then town confirms herself to someone, that's arguably bastard modding because he'd be modconfirming as town a scum player. I mean yeah you can make the argument that Miller/Godfather/Tailor are bastard modding by that rationale but that's different because it is well known that there are roles that impact cop investigations due to the fact that cop investigations are just straight up OP without having the potential for fuckery in the mix.

See viewtopic.php?p=9228468#p9228468 in conjunction with this followup from 1244:



Basically early game ryker I felt good about. Problem is, he hasn't done anything to really maintain my confidence in him and so my town read has been eroding over time. This erosion combined with the new PoE I can use given the new flips and claims is changing my read on the slot. He's no higher than null at this point. With AS flipping town ryker becomes a top contender for 3rd scum in my top 3 after FS and Gamma. I don't have any strong argument for those three as a team via interactions though, so I'll need to do more review before advocating that. So yeah in summary, he's not a top play priority atm but he's no longer a town read for me.



Not sure what you're getting at? Last time I played with neighborizer the role was ""Target a player at night. Target receives confirmation that you are town aligned.""

This is a weaker version of masonizer/mason recruiter which is ""Target a player at night. If target is town aligned, you will be confirmed as town aligned. If target is not town aligned, you die."" Sometimes the role allows for daychat if town is successfully ""masonized."" Sometimes the role allows you to target a new player every night and add to the masonry indefinitely, but if you ever target anti-town, all masoned players die with you. Big risk reward style role. Either way, in my experience both roles involve town confirmation of atleast one player. Are you saying this is not how neighborizer is design here on MS?",71796,2017-05-25 18:30:00,1962

This does make me wonder why it's your favorite role though.

1981,FrozenFlame,"

So let's think about this. Tammy is claiming that she copies the ""first town power role to die."" The automatic nature of the role is unconfirmable, because if she is anti-town with a ""duplicator"" role as described earlier, she could easily choose to just duplicate the first PR to die and then claim she was forced to do so.

So basically one of the following must be true. Either A.) Tammy is town (and therefore presumably has no reason to lie) and is legitimately an automatic backup for the first town PR to die or B.) She is a scum ""duplicator"" that allows her to take on the powers of any dead PR on a night of her choosing.

If B, is the case, then she's capitalizing on the neighborizer flip to pick up an easy to confirm role that frankly doesn't give the town much utility, but boosts her status because she'll get some town cred for her claim checking out. She would do this to avoid having to claim non-automatic town universal backup later in the game, and then have to go though the charade of justifying her later pick and all the rationale that went into the timing of the pick, weighing it against other dead PRs and their utility, etc. Cashing in early for a lukewarm, weak utility role like neighborizer cements her as having an easy safe claim that she can confirm for easy town cred, and allows her to avoid being directed by the town later and thus force her to either cooperate and help the town by extending the life of a stronger town PR, or risk her own life through non-coorperation.

So basically if she's scum, she would have had to identify taking the neighborizer as the low risk low reward play and jumped on this moment to claim in order to make the claim seem more legitimate considering she was under no pressure whatsoever to make her claim. In fact her claim seems impulsive, that impulsivity perhaps driven through legitimate excitement about getting her ""favorite"" role, or perhaps it was calculated ""fake impulsivity"" designed to capitalize on the maelstrom of activity taking place and give her claim a feeling of greater authenticity.

If she's town, then she just claimed what she did because that's what she actually is and didn't have a choice in the matter re: the power she took and was legitimately excited about what she got.

So to summarize, I think if we could actually prove that tammy is an AUTOMATIC backup that has to take the first PR to flip, you're probably right Ran that it would clear her because forcing a scum backup to take the first PR to flip, town or otherwise, could potentially create a lot of problems (problems which people seem to be suggesting would result in the role not making the cut for a normal game here on MS due to the thorough design vetting process). Problem is, we have no way to confirm whether her role is actually automatic or not, because if she had a choice she could very easily just pretend that her hand was forced and there would be no way to contradict her. So ultimately, the context and timing of her claim are more important to look at here when informing your read than the alleged automatic nature of her ability. So in a technical sense no, I don't think her claim clears her. But I think she is unlikely to make such a claim as scum given how much more potential there is for creating misinformation with a scum duplicator role later in the game with a better duplicated claim. But idk, I've never played with tammy before, and maybe the safe, low impact approach is how she plays scum? What do you think Ran?",71796,2017-05-25 19:05:00,1971
1982,FrozenFlame,"

So much this. Now that you've confirmed that you just created a private chat and your power doesn't confirm you as town to anyone, frankly your role is much less useful than I originally thought. Much rather force the scum to choose between odd night cop (and a potential doc coverage of said cop) and you possibly getting private chat with the game's top town read. Plus, now that Ran has already used his ability he's effectively VT, so its nbd if he takes a bullet other than the inconvenience of losing a strong universal town read.

As I've said before, I highly doubt scumscend sticks his neck out like that to lend credence to LaLight's claim. Insanely gambitty for a game where, now that we know AS was town, town's two best wagons D1 were on townies so clearly, pre-claim, scum aren't looking like they're pinned and need some huge game changing claim to revolutionize reads/momentum. Also, as previously mentioned, I doubt he chooses the method he did for supporting LaLight if he's scum. He basically just confirmed he's non-VT and that he has reason to believe the Odd night modifier is in this game. This shows he doesn't want to show his full hand but still wants to clarify the picture we have by minimizing his exposure for relatively greater informational gains since the context he's providing re: whether or not Odd night modifier is likely legitimate outweighs the exposure he's subjecting his own slot to. If he were scum, I'd expect him to make a full claim complementing LaLight's claim to drill the gambit home. If one of them flips scum they're both going down anyway, even with his minimalist support of LaLight by reference to mechanics in his own role PM. If you're going to create that obviously link and risk the one two punch if one of you eventually flips, why not sell the whole thing and just make a full complementary fake claim? It doesn't make sense to me for LaLight/Transcend working together as scum to pull this off in such a half baked fashion.

So generally speaking Transcend's towniness has been on the upswing today from my perspective and he is distinctly a non play. I will note though that I was a bit surprised when he posted 1861 & 1862, saying my firescream voting post was ""good"" and that I ""might not have any tricks up my sleeve."" Came off as trying to butter me up and prevent me from going back and questioning my interpretation of LaLight's claim and his support of it. Sure maybe he's thought I've been genuinely scummy this game and actually got town pings from my post, but it just had this gross feeling of patting me on the head and calling me a good boy while he pulls the wool over my eyes. I think mulch is right to call him on the sketchiness of that.



Well I was deliberately trying to not be this explicit in case the scum were potentially missing it but now that you've said it, I think the clear implication is that transcend is suggestion he is an ""Even Night X"" considering he was saying that he had reason to believe that LaLight's claim of having an Odd night modifier was legitimate. Highly doubt he's another cop, though it isn't impossible. 



It just removes CC ambiguity by omission. If you say you're not cop, you're explicitly confirming you do not intend to CC LaLight. If you say nothing, it's ambiguous. Are you hesitating to CC because you want to see how he conducts himself post claim? Do you have a cop-esque role that doesn't necessarily warrant a direct CC? These are rhetorical questions meant to answer your question of why people are affirmatively saying they do not counterclaim LaLight.



1.) lol yes you were. I don't think it's much of an exaggeration to say that in the first 10 pages or so of D1 you constituted more than half of all posts in the game. That's a bit obnoxious. Don't take it personally though, I wasn't trying to shit talk you I was only using you as an example of distinctly NOT how I think a cop should play the early game. There was nothing inappropriate generally about your play so I hope you aren't taking my comment in that way.

2.) So you're saying you see the logic behind my post, but apparantly I'm bad for TRing people who we have good reason to TR and Im bad for joining a wagon on a scummy slot that my TRs are supporting? :thinkingemoji:

1)  Ok
2)  I think  TRing people in general is more scummy than scumreading people; it means less conflicts and trying to get people on your side.  What's MORE scary is if you have no reason to do it.  The fact that your huge post had no scumreads and then you went on the easiest wagon ever is slarming.

Spoiler:  With your ""wall catchups"", you seem to lack authenticity, with lots of easy stuff to say like ""hate RQS"" and doubt words.  I really like how you scumread me early in the game, although my wagon on AS was not absurd.  Although you seem to want to scumread me for being defensive, which is an easy push to have.  You are aggresive and not afraid to show scumreads, but you have townreads mixed in as well.  I don't like how you call my fight with Zulfy ""something to fall alseep"", I thought it was valid and that pings me a little.  Still scumreading me though which is a plus.  I'm confused about why you don't have me as your top scum with ""kill mulch with fire"" though, which is a gap in logic but not neccecarily AI.  I feel like you are manipulting me on how I was speaking to adumbrodeus.  Why do you keep scumreading me without a vote? It's getting negative at this point.  Again, and again, you obsess over me but don't vote me.  I am nullscum?  Yet you keep mentioning me?  Shading is scummy. Ez vote on lalight.  Buddying gamma.  WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WILL VOTE ME but never do.  And you try to attack my white knighting -_- (NAI).  Again votes lalight? WTF is with this shade on me then?  Aaand quick switch on Zulfy.

It has nothing to do with being stuck up.  It has to do with how I play scum and what good it would do me when I could probably come up with something more useful and easy as scum.

As scum, I fake claim this provable role and have to go with what you said before.  Oh gee golly gosh the person I targeted died or oh guess I was roleblocked.  And what am I supposed to say if I'm tracked to someone when I claim roleblocker?  Oops?  That's just asking for more trouble when I could just play it straight and even here now not make an issue out of myself.  I'm not the greatest scum player in the world, but I'm not incompetent either.  I don't set myself up for failure for no reason at all.",71796,2017-05-25 22:54:00,2033

Ive had really good experiences with neighborhoods.  The social aspect and solving the puzzle are two of my favorite things about mafia and a neighborhood combines those.  Sometimes you can get better reads from a neighborhood tak than in game talk especially considering it's usually harder for scum to keep up with a neighborhood and the thread.  You get a different read that way.  You can also talk during the night and gamesolve after flips which can be given to the thread by your neighbor in the event of your death.

There's a part of me that wants to just let this meta tell sit, but my activity level more often than not is dictated by my real life situation than my alignment.  I've definitely been very active scum and lurky town.  (I think the meta you're getting is from a long time ago when I was in grad school working part time and had oodles of time for the game.  Having a real job and other real life commitments put a dent in that.)

I do hate playing scum though and it drains me, so if I draw scum a few times in a row or if I'm not in a very good mental state I am more likely to lurk yes.  But it's a little more complicated that active = town, lurking = scum.

Are you talking about this post? viewtopic.php?p=9246967#p9246967

I mean LaLight's claim kind of obviates doing a full ISO on him. I believe the claim and nothing he's done has been so overtly scummy that I would say he's a play over FS or Gamma right now.

I talk about the FS stuff that bothered me here (viewtopic.php?p=9248222#p9248222) and here (viewtopic.php?p=9249084#p9249084)

Gamma I've said multiple times is more of a gut read than anything. If you're looking for a full ISO I cant get to that until tomorrow as I blew all of my uninterrupted mafia time earlier today ISOing adum & FS. I can do AS/Gamma tomorrow.

As for hating on my suggestion to neighborize ran, I understand that you don't want to run the risk of Ran eating the bullet and then giving tammy the opportunity to play the ""lol I keep failing and can never confirm my claim"" card but that was really just coming from the idea that Ran is the most trusted, and now borderline cleared slot in the game, so he'd be the best to report back. But yeah you're right, its not necessarily the top play as it puts too many eggs in one basket counting on scum to feel pressure to off LaLight as claimed cop. Between marshy and Ran that 50/50 is good enough IMO, but yeah the more I think about it, tammy faking this claim and then needing to rope a scum mate in to fake confirm the neighborization seems wayyyy too involved for such a low stakes claim, so really she can target whoever she pleases, no need for direction as confirmation should be a no brainer here. The key is landing on someone who survives like you said. Problem is, if we don't direct tammy, she can always do what you've articulated fear of; claim she targeted whoever ends up dying. Without forcing her to commit to a set, scumtammy will always have the option to claim she targeted the NK. But yeah ultimately you're right that it doesn't need to be ran and we probably shouldnt direct her to ONLY target ran to keep scum guessing.",71796,2017-05-25 23:58:00,2051

Believe it or not this also is pretty much informing my lynch pool. To steal from Ran who stole from Transcend:

Agent Sparkles (4): Ranmaru, LaLight, FrozenFlame, Gamma Emerald

Not Voting (1): Zulfy

With 13 alive, it takes 7 to lynch.

Killing AS was legit I wouldn't pick a better target. Also I believe every claim so far, but the only one I have doubts about is Tammy's. UB is a cool role for scum, both because it's obviously useful for fakeclaim as UB and it's useful for fakeclaim as a role they inherited. I myself modded a couple of games where scum was given roles that look townie and won easily.

The remaining list:
Mulch - PoE town, no strong read on him
FireScreamer - voting for him and think he's the most obvious scum here. Also this replacement reminds me of rb's ""realise you're bad as scum and leave"" replacement. Fine with my vote for now
Ryker - The scummiest one. His AtE, tunneling of me, tunneling of other people, lack of meaningful posts whatsoever
FrozenFlame - I believe them to be town. This and this for one aare really good posts and they are not the ony ones.
Gamma Emerald - This is pretty bad given that both wagons were on town. Looks like GE found a cool excuse to bus/drive a mislynch. Also there's really a shitton of one-liners that never mean anything, ugh.

Sorry to hear you're going through IRL struggles man. Unfortunately if your inactivity is supposed to be NAI then frankly your mild AtE here re: IRL I have to take as NAI as well.

In any event, can we just close out this wagon and save the potential replacement the pain and suffering of replacing into an 80+ page game in a slot that's about to be lynched anyway? Plus having memorial day weekend be a night phase sounds just peachy kthx



Really don't know what else I can do to show you I'm town at this point, I really am trying. I think you're just confusing rusty ass low confidence kind shitty at mafia rn 2017 FF for scumFF. If my scumhunting seems off or poor to you, I can assure you its just because 2017 FF fucking sucks at mafia compared to 2012 and earlier FF. It's just kind of the truth, I'm out of practice and so I'm struggling to develop strong read like I used to. If you want evidence that I'm actually this bad as town these days I urge you to go read Dark Tower Mafia over on the xkcd mafia forums. I quite literally threw the game there for town and my next most recent game is probably like 3-4 years ago. Honestly don't know what else to say to you at this point to help correct your misread.

I do hope that we have an opportunity to chill at national again someday soon so you marshy ran and adum can haze the shit out of me if I throw this game too. Then we can play some IRL mafia and I can stomp you all out because that's really all I was playing through law school =P

2139,Ranmaru,"

I have discovered that my confidence sometimes blocks me from making actual progress (finding scum and killing them). I sometimes find that I've been defending scum all game in other games, which makes me lean to being a bit more flexible and open with my reads. I also noted that Red Ryu had some good reads in Flavorless Mafia II since he wasn't as involved as others, but he could see the big picture. Also like I mentioned to Marshy, those scum were not hype to me at all. It feels a lot better to lynch scum when you feel it is right. In those kinds of games town wins, and I'm like ""yay let's celebrate!"" but no one is hype enough to celebrate lol.",71796,2017-05-26 13:32:00,2129

In terms of my own defense: i don't know how to explain it again, I still think what Ryker did was scummy and I'm not going to vote everyone I think is scummy, especially in RVS.

I think when I'm not town or when I have been away from the game for a while and come back and need to refresh myself. Since as scum I would need to construct arguments I don't believe in, I would not care to really think about it deeply. As either alignment and I have been away from the game for a bit, I would probably just have forgotten and need to re-read.

I imagine the game is over. Lynch FS, lynch Gamma, lynch me or FF, lynch FF if you lynched me. Game over.

as town hes much more independent. he is likelier to go out of his way to fight people that others arent paying attention to if he himself believes them to be scum

he is logical with a sharp grasp of the game and deep understanding regardless of alignment. he ""watches"" the power players and factors their thought processes and direction into his decision making processes regardless of alignment too but after a while you get a grimy feel from it if hes scum

he is a hard read this game. the claims really fucked things up for us and made things complicated. the most telling interactions from him and imo the best chance you have of pulling out a read on him is analyzing his fights with gamma and tammy plus anything flipped scum say about him. i have not played with him as scum in probably like 5 years

I told penguin I would be replacing out when day started as I just don't have time.  I won't have time for another three weeks probably.  Sorry to everyone; I really shouldn't have joined, but I really wanted to play with ranmaru when he asked.  I wrote up a replace out post about five times yesterday, but kept hoping I'd be able to find the time and stick it out, but I just don't.

Also I'm sorry that I got so frustrated with frozen flame that one day, I was stressed and playing with someone I do hate playing with and that spilled in to here.

I look forward to playing with you guys another time.

My best bet for scum remaining are in ryker, frozen flame and transcend.  If one of those is wrong gamma I guess and I thoight mulch looked pretty town.  It was really weird how any time someone voted for ryker transcend would jump on them, felt weird considering in his last reads he only has him as leaning town.

Then Ranmaru made his shot and that read sorta went away because idk why that my role would get two false negatives. So I think Light's scum after all.

Regardless of that, I checked someone I thought was scum and others thought was town to ultimately sort the slot. It came up guilty. I think he knew it was him since his posting dramatically deteriorated once I made my soft announcement. Anyways.

All the roles except mine are of questionable usefulness level for town and should be played really well. I actually was thinking Transcend is an Even-night Doctor which would make a prefect sense.

By the way, just occurred to me, is Gunsmith considered Normal role?

I am starting heavily scumreading Mulch for his undying wish to hear the claim from Transcend, I would say only scum would do such a thing, because they are really nervous. Also ""Scum always votes first in LyLo"" lol. Not really. But this vote for Tammy was bad. And scum also likes to highlight ""we're in LyLo"" because there's no way we wouldn't figure out ourselves and scum must've discussed it. So yeah, Mulch is relaxed scummo for sure.

FF remains quite townie imo. Same reasons as yesterday: big, good, townie-looking posts. Not a default lynch for now anyway.

I'm VT.

Gamma/Transcend claim contradiction means our play ought to be between the two of them today. Very heavily leaning GE considering he's been in my lynchpool pretty much all game and my analysis re: Transcend sticking his neck out for LaLight yesterday still stands. Don't see scum transcend doing that when we were basically on course to mislynch FS anyway.

Tammy targetting marshy is questionable at best. Sure, marshy was pseudo cleared since we're believing Lalight's claim but that just makes him an obvious target. Frankly, marshy was more likely to be targeted than Lalight because Lalight isn't a threat again until tonight if he's odd night cop and marshy flipping town does nothing to confirm lalight while lalight flipping town cop 100% clears marshy barring godfather type shit. Scum are smart and knew a marshy townflip doesnt clear lalight because scum can easy fake that result, thought I'm not sure Lalight was under so much pressure that it warranted him quick fake claiming cop with an uncontroversial clear on a townie to get focus off of him. All in all marshy looks like a good target to neighborize because he's a trusted pseudo cleared slot that can reliably report back on Tammy's ability, but a little more thought reveals that he's actually likely to be a top contender for the NK over LaLight. Ran and marshy I think are the two hardest ""clears"" in the game right now and with scum likely anticipating MYLO, they want to get rid of as many clear or close clears as possible.

Either way, as said above, tammy isn't a play today given Transcend/GE claim contradiction.

Mulch's jumpiness is unsettling as fuck.

Ran if you legitimately think I could be scum with GE and Ryker you've gotta be out of your mind. I've had GE in my lynch pool basically all game and I literally switched on having ryker as town to having him as scum lean for pretty much no reason other than I though he wasn't doing anything to maintain my town read of him. That's a flimsy ass bus if that's what you actually think that is, especially when ryker wasn't even being considered as a play at that point.

Not sure what to think about GE's whole 1/6 vs 1/9 alleged scum slip. Need to think about that some more and let all of this digest a bit.

Transcend's crumbs are meh. Don't necessarily ping as faked but the commuter crumb to mislead especially could have been fake context building from a skilled player with enough foresight to recognize that sending mixed crumb signals to confuse the scum would ostensibly look good. Basically the crumbs aren't enough to convince me but they don't make me question my already town lean on Transcend just by his play.

But yeah overall going to need to do some re-reading before I come down on this but very much preferring GE lynch over transcend right now and that won't be disturbed lightly",71796,2017-05-31 13:21:00,2404

Transcend + Lalight + Mulch.

---

They are suspicious by play and by claims. Transcend has crumbs that are not convincing, and are past D1. It's possible his mates could have role copped myself or someone else to have an idea of what to crumb. Transcend didn't commit to Agent Sparkles, his main scumread of D1. He made an awkward switch to Zulfy. D2, he makes a VCA and tries to use the fact Agent Sparkles is scum and uses that to kill Firescream before having Agent Sparkles scum flip in hand. It turns out, both were town. He has a 'meh' stance on Gamma all game but when I bring up things that may turn his read to Gamma town he never considers it or speaks to me to reconsider it, he simply keeps him at meh. I note the non-engagement, and the apathetic play. Yet I don't find it to be suspicious. 

Lalight, has scum intent in his play as I have already outlined in my 1642. Most importantly his entrance is telling. His tone changes between D1 and D2 are also telling. I noted that in D2, he had the same tone as he did in the scum game he has given me. Another major concern is he claimed cop very early without pressure, most likely to seem town rather to gain reactions + a wagon. I would lynch him today if the Transcend/Gamma situation wasn't here. Yet, I want him dead. Eventually, I don't care if he is cop. He must die. He admits to playing scummy as a method of playing PR's. I don't totally agree with that. I don't trust his slot, I want it dead in the water.

Mulch I have explained as the one to be my least confident scum read, yet he is still suspicious. I mention his very early post discrediting ryker when he didn't even scum read him, is suspicious because there was no town motivation to post that other than to shade a player as he blames others of doing to him. I also find it majorly concerning that he had not done a full reads list but instead has been doing them 1 by 1 or 2 by 2. It would give him a chance to not give a stance on everyone, and he could come out with a stance out of no where on Transcend or Marshy. His reaction to the mass claim seemed like a soft, and then he claims VT which doesn't make sense. He can read, so there was no purpose to ask about mass claim. (He was like 'uh... right ok... I had a claim but ok...' is what it sounded like). I find his questioning telling, such as asking about who I'd trust between him and Transcend if Transcend gave him a guilty. I also agree with Ryker that his play this phase was bad, doesn't seem to be like a townie who is being cautious and wants to win the game. I also felt he wasn't really trying to sort Tammy but really just condemn her for missing her action.",71796,2017-06-01 01:35:00,2501

Consider that Agent Sparkles flipped neighbor, which is an investigative role. I am a 1-shot vig. I would find it to be reasonable to have something to balance against the vig, which makes sense of being the universal back-up. I don't actually disbelieve tammy here, I just wish she didn't actually claim UB outright, but I do know she loves neighbor. Even so, if this is correct, then we can assume the UB + Vig may be legit. There's no protective in sight. I don't think there would be a cop and a gunsmith, which are two investigative alongside a neighbor. Ask yourselves if Tammy isn't UB, how would there be a role to balance my role? I don't think the gunsmith or cop would balance against them. Gunsmith seems like it would make sense alongside a vig because a vig has a gun but yet Transcend's crumbs are vague and don't actually mention anything about gunsmith. Everyone else is VT, it seems. I think that's it. I think Transcend and Lalight are both fake claiming, yes I know that's crazy. Notice Lalight's entrance to D3, was still suspicious, even when he is outed. I would expect a town cop to actually act with more bravado and energy after being outed, but I see none of that here. There is no town motivation there.",71796,2017-06-01 01:35:00,2502

1) You keep mentioning this, and I would call him out on it every time if I could: There is literally no point to asking a question you can ask a mod in private in the chat publicly except for town cred.

2)  I can give a full reads list if you requested it or even now, it's just meta.  In fact, I post big long walls as scum

3)  It's not my fault someone joked about a mass claim so I needed to know if we were actually doing it

4)  Again, I am aggresive because I am excited, this is literally my first MyLo as town

5)  Correct lol but nothing I can say about that, the odds of tammy being right here are so extraodrinarily low (I still think this), that I really dont have any qualms to aggresively pushing her, I didn't even know there was a guilty before i pushed her and once we got the guilty I reassessed",71796,2017-06-01 02:22:00,2510

the replace out ITSELF is nai but given the circumstances she was in AKA if she were mafia a big fake claim gambit, replacing out at this stage would be tactical and i just don't feel that's something tammy would do just to get a win she won't even have as she's not in the slot anymore.

As for Titus's claim. I think he might just be insane. Odd night cop is a nutty strong role. Never played with a gunsmith, but most cop variant roles are powerful.

Why not? Ostensibly there are 3 scum and allegedly there are two false positives for gunsmith. In a game with a UB to help strengthen town investigative ability, why ought there not be 2 false positives to help off set the 3 potential scum gunsmith can hit when scum has no other defense against gunsmith? I can see why theres room for doubt here but I really don't see an argument for how there being two false positives by deliberate design for balance is out of the question.

It's fucking MYLO and if I'm GE and I know someone is lying about me, I'd be frothing at the mouth pushing that lynch because I now know the guaranteed safe path to keeping town in the game. But we haven't gotten that at all. All we got was ""lol guiz transcend is lying"" and a crossvote with literally nothing helpful after that other than a few random one liners. Nothing substantive. It feels like GE just knows he's caught and doesn't want to potentially expose his scummates through more detailed interaction. He's just clamming up and hope transcend ropes himself thanks to growing paranoia re: the claims. If I were GE, and I KNEW that transcend was scum, which he should if GE is actually town, I'd be doing everything I could to build a case on transcend and bust this game wide open. But we've gotten the farthest thing from it, nothing but coasting and waiting.

Transcend is atleast trying on some level to get people on GE. Granted it hasn't been much more effort than transcend has put into any wagon he's endorsed this game but that typicality isn't undermining my faith in his claim nor my read on his gradually improving play this game.

Between these two the choice is clear to me. If GE is town, he's completely dropped the ball given the situation he's in, but I suspect he's just caught scum unsure of how this 50/50 will play out and wants to be conservative incase he gets lynch and we can then use his ISO to tease out the rest of the team. If transcend is scum, frankly he did a great job gambitting on supporting the Lalight claim and capitalizing on not really needing to do so and selling it for town cred. He really had no reason to do that unless both him and LaLight are scum which I just very strongly doubt at this point; they had no motive to help narrow the lynch pool yesterday the way they did by clearing marshy and removing LaLight from lynch contention through his claim. If Transcend is scum here I just been straight outplayed with help from townGE just rolling over and letting scum close the game out when he's the only person in the game who KNOWS who a mafiat is. There's just no way I see any good faith townie like GE is in this situation.

VOTE: Gamma Emerald

Sorry if I'm throwing this town but the more and more I read through this day phase I only feel more strongly about this. I'm kind of feeling ryker's frustrated sentiments here re: this game being draining thanks to zulfy/FS/tammy all barely playing and us getting baited/pseudo forced into dealing with those slots else face an impossible endgame. I ISO'd every dead player in the game D2 to help me decide whether to stay or switch on FS and that only lead me to join a mislynch so at this point I'm convince that our reads collectively have just been shit this game and that focusing on this 50/50 is the best way to build an understanding of this game from the ground up. My gut has been telling me GE all game so at this point that plus GE's general apathy with the keys to the game in hand if he's town is more than enough for me to say he's the play.",71796,2017-06-01 14:24:00,2719

Wondering how you're going to prove you're town but looking forward to it. You and Ran basically get to decide the game at this point considering everyone else has voted and both wagons need two votes. Would be nice knowing our undecideds are both conf town.

Agreed that ryker is looking gross this dayphase. Tammy's slot is now too



like lmao are you fucking kidding? You're telling our conftown to shut up and not guide votes? The conftown?! This is borderline scum slip, like how could you possibly want there to be less guaranteed town voice in fucking mylo when clearly the scum are looking to guide to a game ending mislynch. Just..... wow



oh I see you're probably scum trying to keep both wagons competitive so that Ran has a hard time picking. Make the choice look as close as possible to created FUD. Classic

What are you talking about? Both wagons are at 3, and we need 5. Only mulch and Ran haven't voted. If Ran votes wrong is game over because a scum will jump to hammer unless all three scrum are wagoning together right now. If Ran picks right the game isn't over by a long shot. We still need to convince mulch to hammer if mulch is town or to bus his partner if mulch is scum. Or for someone else to change their mind and hammer/bus their partner. Ran only decides this game if he picks wrong and all three scum aren't voting together right now. Like.... what are you even thinking?



1.) Alright well you said you could clear yourself which is pretty strong language but I get what you meant now.

2.) Dude how the fuck could you possibly believe that's the scum team? Literally the two people I've picked fights with in this game are GE and Tammy. GE has pretty much always been in my lynch pool, and frankly I antagonized tammy for no good reason. Why would I deliberately antagonize them both when neither of them was in top contention as a play? That's the shittiest bussing I've ever seen if that's what you think was going on. Like I would have just been blatantly conjuring reasons to fight with my partners for no goddamn reason. And do you seriously believe I'm looking to bus GE here and ride any credit I get from that to endgame? I've been on and off people's lynchpools all game. Why would I have the confidence to think I could get away with forcing a bus here and then riding the cred for a later phase win? If tammy and GE were my partners I'd be full blow attacking transcend and going for the win right now. I'm honestly shocked you think a me, GE, tammy team would be trying to play the long game right now.",71796,2017-06-01 18:14:00,2731

dude if you're town you owe us more than this. If you're just going to post a no reasoning vote you could have done that ages ago. You can't just sit around undecided in a situation like this and then just plop down a vote once the votes start flying and not even explain why. I really want to believe you're town dude but you pulling shit like this is making me paranoid that you and transcend did in fact pull a combo gambit to clear and then kill marshy to make your fake cop claim look legit and set up for a one two punch endgame. like fuckkkkkkkk dude",71796,2017-06-01 18:18:00,2732

2792,Mulch,"I am having conflicting thoughts in my head.

1) I sincerely believe that Gamma scumslipped, and that she and tammy are a scumteam together.  This could explain why Titus is voting Transcend, and Ryker too.   HOWEVER.  Right now, if scum mess up (either Gamma is lynched as scum or Transcend is lynched as scum)...they still have 2 more lynches we need to get.  It makes no sense why they would all go in one basket.  I know for a fact that I would want to go in the OPPOSITE basket if I was scum in this situatio (Ie bussing).   Therefore, assuming Titus+Gamma are scum together, that would mean Lalight or FF are the bussers here.  An interesting thing is that if Tammy AND lalight are both scum, that would mean that Transcend is 100% town, due to lack of power roles for the town.  If FF is the one bussing, that would make sense- FF, Tammy, Gamma- but that post frozenflame just made is really convincing to me and to me seemed to show real emoition.  I was scumreading FF earlier but I forget why

2) Transcend has been fucking buddyin me the entire game, saying he TR me earlier, trying to pocket me, the weird wagon switch to the person I wanted to lynch, like he has been connecting himself with me all game.  I also had a strong scumreading on transcend basically for these things before he claimed even night SOMETHING which immediately made me want to trust him.  But now he just did it again- ""If I die...mulch is town 100%"".  WTF?  It's like blatant and I think he could easily think I am some idiot noob would would love to be taken advantage of my a smart scum.  

My problem with Transcend being scum, though is a lot:
1) This would mean that if Tammy is scum (which I am almost sure), he would be bussing (which is okay). 
2)  Why is gamma not doing anything to defend herself?",71796,2017-06-02 00:02:00,2782

Pretty frustrated that you checked me tbh LaLight, I thought my play yesterday was pretty fucking obvtown being #2 on the GE lynch after Trans. Would've been much better checking someone who wasnt on the GE wagon to see if we had any nonbussing scum. Frankly the fact that you picked me just makes me extra paranoid about you considering all you've had for us all game are innos. Conveniently clearing my, imo obvtown since yesterday slot versus going after someone more questionable (i.e. didn't vote/bus GE). Ugh.

Titus how exactly is ryker confscum from your perspective? Really need you to explain that more explicitly. Ryker crossvote is interesting. Technically we're out of blitz range at 4v2 though so not quite as conclusive might normally be the case here.

Is there any particular reason why we ought not no lynch today? Trans investigation is on deck again so pressure is on scum to remove that threat and give us another flip to work with else face possible results again. I feel like this option really needs to be discussed.

Titus and ryker are both gross af to me right now but need to slow this down a bit and think now that we finally have a scum flip. Don't expect much from me for the rest of the night, big smash tourney stream will have my attention. I'll be able to sit down and really start thinking through all that's in front of us tomorrow night probably.

Well if you're weighing Transcend as scum, who would his partner be? Why would he fake a guilty? Was gamma autolynch without it? That doesn't make much sense.

We know Frozen cannot be with Gamma. He can only be with you. If you Frozen is the team, you bussing Gamma makes little sense.

Ryker/Trans/Gamma makes little sense as scum discrediting a bus on Gamma makes no sense.

You and Trans makes no sense because of you not immediately pushing a Ryker lynch.

Trans and Mulch would have to be the most likely by PoE and that seems weak.",71796,2017-06-05 04:12:00,2922

I'm basically just sitting here waiting on a verdict. I can answer anything, but from my PoV, Titus pretty much has to be scum. Scum team has to be Titus/Lalight or Titus/Mulch and I don't have the stomach to push Titus/Mulch after calling Lalight scum the entire, fucking, game when he's bringing up Transcend/Mulch as a possible scum team at this point.

I'm voting Titus. Barring someone outright claiming scum, I'll be voting Lalight next phase unless someone has a CRAZY good sell on doing something else that doesn't include ScumRyker.

I think I'm pretty obviously not aligned with Lalight or Titus given our interactions. I think the only realistic scum team you can suggest with me in it at this point is Ryker/Mulch.

I was fed up with Titus yesterday.

Titus is the one thing I hate most when playing games. Doesn't play the game as intended. Didn't read, was spewing things that could be dispelled easily by reading (possibility of scum Ran), was hounding me about how townies act with bullshit statements that don't hold true to the game (scum sell, town solves, why me = fry me). With the way Lalight has been posting about my slot for the entire game, Titus's opinion of my slot, Ran starting the phase going back on me, and all around people just keeping me high in the lynch pool, I didn't see much of a point to continuing the game if I was just gonna die a week or two later and lose the game if we were correct. I'm still pretty much just ready for the game to be over with.

I voted you over Gamma based on my opinion that the set-up shouldn't have both your role and Lalight's. Even-night Gunsmith is a much more convoluted role and easier to claim after an odd night role has been claimed. Gamma as a claim would be the perfect way to get a closing lynch because almost everyone had Gamma in a ""can go"" pile. All-in-all, the decision between which one to lynch was still a pretty large crap shoot from my PoV.",71796,2017-06-05 14:25:00,3042

3087,Mulch,"Here is why Lalight is scum.  This is only the day today.  

He says he checks Frozen Flame has his cop check
Right off the bat, we have something weird.  Everyone (including me) was expecting him to check Titus.  FrozenFlame had made very townie posts in the past few days, and it makes zero sense to want to check him.  This is the first red flag.  It allows him to still accuse everyone still in contention.  

HIs response to Titus ""forgetting"" to submit a neighborization
What kind of fucking reaction is this?  The correct townie reaction here is to be extraordinarily skeptical of this.  He says ""oh really"".  Oh really?  Oh really?  Your going to say oh really?  That's the best thing you can say?  Your not heavily in disbelief?  Your not even going to comment that you believe it?  That's ALL your going to say?  Here is why Lalight is scum:  a townie would push him for this, like I did.  He was interseted in just letting it go while he moved onto his targets and his gameplan.

Here he says he wants to No Lynch, which is fine, but Transcend fights him on this here, and Lalight fights back again.  He is really resolute.  Yet, somehow, his great position on this changes here.   This is bad yet it get's worse.  The REASON he changes is because Transcend said he wanted to gamesolve and would get nightkilled.  Therfore, with that post, Lalight is agreeing that we should not lynch because we want Transcend's solving ability..  Transcend's solving ability is SO great that it would change his already huge postiiton on no lynching.  Would this NOT suggest that he thinks Transcend is town?  Apparently not, or not, or not.  Yes, Lalight changed his position on this because he thought we needed Transcend's gamesolving so badly yet apparently thinks he could be mafia.

Let's get onto his vote on me.  Let's not forget that this is LyLo, so although I can't technically prove to all of you that he wanting to lynch me will end the game, to ME it is basically a scumclaim.  So, here is how it goes.

Apparently the scum team is me and Titus (remember that he did not even press Titus for forgetting a neighborization).  This is his ""scumread"" on me.  I am going to quote it here, just for everyone to clearly see:



Yup.  His huge scumread, his overpowering scumread for me that is causing him (theoretically him as townie) to vote me in LyLo is:  I was relaxed last round.  Wow.  Oh, and apparently This too, which consists of Gamma shading me the entire game (something I should have picked up on, admitadly), also is hard core incriminating LyLo evidence.  

Throughout this, he is very resolute about lynching me (yes, even as he is simeoultaneously pushing for a no lynch), very, very, resolute.

Yet, throughout all this hard core scumreading me for being relaxed, he also feels the need to keep his options open.  Titus/Ryker?, Titus/Mulch? Ryker/Mulch?.  Yes, he apparently is thinking those are ""possibilties"" as well despite voting ME.  

So now let's go onto His vote on Titus.  This would be a good thing, actually, to me, considering that he shaded him earlier in the day, (although refsues to press him on not submitting a neighborization), yet within a minute or two HE UNVOTES, and backs this up using the worst logic in the history of the world, saying, that he thinks ME AND TRANSCEND ????  are a scum team together.  This is the look of a scum that was LOOKING for an excuse to unvote Titus, either because they are scum partners or because he thinks I would be an easier target.  Also, his reason for this unprecendeted scumread is that he ""can"" doubt someone if he wants to.  Good for you.  

Also, as bonus:

Appeal to emotion number 1
Appeal to emoition Number 2
Appeal To emoition number 3
Appeal To emoition Number 4

And finally, doublebonus, one ridiculous last lack of logic:
He says scum ""went"" into the day looking to kill him.  Yup, with zero people voting him, and me only voting you after you tried to push a mislynch on me.  




Rest case.
VOTE: Lalight for more emphasis.",71796,2017-06-05 19:51:00,3077
3088,FrozenFlame,"Don't expect any quick decision from me here guys. I had a crazy busy day today and didn't get a chance to do the reading I wanted to do. Going to try to get through it as fast as I can but I have another busy day tomorrow so finding the optimal play here is definitely a WIP for me. Apologies if people are trying to wrap this game up quick but frankly I'd feel like I was truly throwing the game if I didn't pace myself here. If im gonna fuck this up and throw the game, I want to atleast be able to say I tried my best and didn't get lazy under pressure.

Mod: Official vote count & deadline post asap please? Would be much obliged 

Transcend, gonna be honest bro right now I have you as my strongest townread. If you need to talk shit out with me lets do it. From my surface level read of today I'm not picking up on any specific questions directed at me but you've said you want to hear from me. Just lay it down and Ill get @ you.

Generally I'm still a bit confused as to why no lynching here isn't the play. For starters we overall get a more robust mathematical advantage. Going from 4-2 to 3-2 risk free is a free (.4-.33)% edge. Why not force scum to move and rule out potential scum combos? And plus the payoff for no lynch now is even greater than the mere odds edge by virtue of info production pressure. Going into night 4 scum have pressure to:

- Kill me as a townread cop clear (I present as a nonviable endgame lynch target and thus must be dealt with else be a necessary persuasion target)

- Kill Transcend who pressures via gunsmith claim

- Kill Titus (if they're concerned about losing titus as a viable mislynch when getting confirmation of her inheritance of her ability would stand in stark contrast to all the convenient fuck ups)

With so much split pressure, forcing the scum to move gives us more info re: what they actually fear and thus what their likely envision path to endgame is. And again, we gain all of this information at no cost. Yes, we lose likely a strong and useful town voice in me or transcend, but still, the info gained will only stand to benefit the surviving party. If transcend is scum then I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that I've been outplayed by an insane bus gambit and that's that. So basically what I'm saying is I don't see any particularly prejudicial to the town wincon to sacrifice a single town voice for all of these informational and odds benefits. Plus if we mandate titus targets me with her ability overnight and trans checks titus, we're guaranteed to get info re: that slot. If I live you get cleared info that her ability works or doesnt. If I die, trans can clear/condemn titus. Guaranteed info like that going into true 3-2 lylo could be absolutely crucial and really force the scum's hand assuming we succeed in lynching scum D5.

Basically unless someone can give me a VERY compelling, well explained reason why town stands to gain some sort of advantage by going all in, against the odds and free information, and trying to nail the scum lynch here and then just NLing to get a 2-1 lylo, that's where my vote goes for now

VOTE: No Lynch

I'm completely down to talk about whatever needs to be discussed before we lose a useful voice, but still I think the mathematical and information advantages are silly to pass up when town seems to have power tempo this game.

Don't take this post as me absolutely refusing to lynch today. I can be persuaded but I honestly just can't see how that's optimal play here. If someone can demonstrate what we stand to lose by going the NL lynch route, I'll certainly reconsider. I need more time to ISO GE and re-read yesterday so get a handle on how his wagon evolved.

2) My only worry about no lynching is that 1) We give scum more time to plan out a strategy when they may have been taken by surprise that I am attacking Lalight 2) They're gonna kill the most confirmed townie here (most likely Transcend cause he is even night) and then we will be down to deciding LyLo with one less competetent townie yet still the same 5 suspects, so it would be the exact same situation, but worse because no candidate for lynching would ever get killed.

I need you to clarify what you mean in the bold. Isn't it true that this holds regardless of if we NL now? The lynchpool wont narrow through NKs by your proposition because of functional clears. How is this progression at all impacted by whether or not we NL now, versus D5 assuming we get scum today?



Dude this is seriously not good enough I need to hear an actual reason. The fact that I'm up against resistance for free value without even hearing the highlights of how the theory behind how we're better served by going all in here is a bit frustrating.

I have already explained why I didn't check Titus and checked FF. I was suspicious of my townread and I thought there can be roles like 1-shot GF and/or 1-shot Framer (that are used on my site). 



I don't think you understand what I have meant. It was sceptical ""oh really"". After you Titus is my best lynch candidate. Have you ever pushed her yourself?



I have just lost the confidence that people will wish to No Lynch toDay. I mean you're looking for throats, all of you (except occasionally FF). So I started looking who might be a viable lynch for today and came to realisation Trans/you is the possibility of a team.



Yes, I do keep the options open, what's exactly weird about it? I am not 100% sure about any one of you. And also, I can't prove that lynching me will finish the game either. Case on you is good enough for me to think that you are scum with more than 50% probability.



The second vote on MyLo = the vote that can cause quickhammer. I felt like Trans was manipulating me into the vote Titus so he and you could quickhammer, that's just what I felt, and I unvoted immediately, because there's no rush. I didn't need any excus to unvote Titus, why wouldn't I just vote for Ryker or for you out of the gates?

3098,FrozenFlame,"

This table in no way engages with the fact that there is inherent cost to lynching today vs. no lynching. We sacrifice the .4 - .33 statistical edge and all of the potential scum teams that people might compose with me and you in them despite what I would argue is our cleared status. We also sacrifice potentially going into 3 - 2 with two ""cleared"" townies. If I die, you can check Titus which resolves that slot putting you in a position to nail a 2/3 chance to lynch scum D5. If you die, I'm basically in the same position except instead of a gun-check result on Titus I get to confirm whether or not she actually got the neighborizer power and thus whether she actually is a backup of some sort, which leans heavily town here IMO. Therefore, I'm in the same position to hit scum with a 2/3 chance between ryker, mulch, and lalight. Not bad odds at all.

So yes town uses someone useful in either you or me, but frankly can you really say that just having quick lynch protection and being able to communicate live during lylo decision making is worth setting up for a 2/3 shot in lylo? I mean, if titus is bad, our plan basically confirms we out her for D5 which is a free pass into 2 - 1 endgame. So yeah I'm really having a hard time seeing whats gained by taking a game ending chance at far worse odds right now. Yes, eventually we'll have to ""all in"" but you always have to in lylo, which is unavoidable. If we have a pressure release valve option before having to all in, and we can optimize our chances before the all in, why not do so? And yes though being able to avoid quicklynch is handy if people are feeling particularly jumpy, but Id like to believe that no townie in their right mind would go into D5 3 - 2 and just slap down a vote without realizing they were risking a quickhammer if their vote is TvT. I mean that's just basic endgame awareness, I don't think that's too much to ask for or expect from players here. Not to mention the added advantage of knowing definitively whether you have a TvS or SvS crossvote when someone votes in 3 - 2 and there's no quick hammer.

Anyway, not trying to be stubborn here but I'm just honestly still unpersuaded that we ought make the potentially game ending call right now. I don't see what unique advantage we have just by virtue of transcend and I both being alive and able to vote when we make the decision, versus us discussing who we think the final scum team combos could be, contingent on info we can get on titus, and then trusting the survivor to make the much easier call in 3 - 2, or just nail the free scum lynch upon guilty confirmation.",71796,2017-06-06 12:48:00,3088

Ok I get that its nice to have other cleared or universally read town slots around in endgame but Im not sure what this dependability nets us. Like whats stopping you from providing your reads and proposition for the ideal play today, us going NL to get the stats and info edge, and then even if you die, I and the other townies still have your reads and guidance to work with even if you aren't in the game anymore?



Same as above. How does you probably dying over night in a NL going to prejudice the towns ability to nail the final scum if you already have ample opportunity in this day phase to explain what you think the best plays are going forward? You can easily provide us with reads and contingent reads depending on whether titus is able to confirm to me and such.

Bleh. Idk I guess we're just not seeing eye to eye on this. You seem to be really adamant that we must lynch today and my objective analysis doesn't seem to hold any weight with you. With everyone else crossvoting Im not sure if I can get a NL coalition without your support. I'm willing to move forward on this if y'all are unpersuadable but man I really feel like we're giving up a freebie by forgoing the NL.

So talk to me trans, what are you feeling? There's a part of me that really wants to believe that its ryker/titus and we're giving the scum too much credit by assuming they bussed when there was a very competitive wagon on you that they had a realistic chance I think of pushing through for the win.

I understand where mulch is coming from on LaLight but I'm having trouble placing his partner if its LaLight scum. It could be you and LaLight I supposed but goddamn that is a crazy gambit you two pulled off and at this point Im willing to say that you two cant be partners and if you are we've all been seriously outplayed. If Lalight is bad, who with?

Mulch has been tough for me to read all game but my gut leans town and I'll need some serious convincing if people want him as the play.

@Transcend what do you think of my Lalight case?  Would you be willing to vote Lalight?

@Lalight you didn't even defend against anything you just stated objective facts.  Also, LOL at saying ""after me"" Titus is the best candidate when ZERO people have experessed voting me yet you still won't vote Titus.  :thinking:

@Mulch I don't say the action of trying to lynch me is town motivated. I think that you sincerely think it's 1v1 and you're town, I am scum. I don't know, scum would behave more carefully, not so aggressively imo. And the thing that you thunk the game is solved. I just don't see that coming from scum, clear town perspective.

@Titus The question of wy I didn't check you is explained by me a thousand times and if you ask it, you don't really read the thread which I don't like.

This is what I was trying to avoid by slowing the game down ;_;

So it was GE/Ryker/Transcend. Fuck, brutal. I was really leaning Ryker/Titus. Shocked @ Transcend scum, pulled some crazy shit that he didn't have to, but damn did it work out

Should've realized it was really suspicious that you were so against NL with really no strong reason why. Would've made you look pretty damn sketchy if I died over you when clearly your claim was the bigger threat. I should've held my ground more and pushed harder for the NL.

Anyway gg guys. Kind of kicking myself for not pushing ryker harder but frankly I have a feeling I wouldve ended up being ok with titus lynch and made the same mistake even after more deliberation. Part of me wants to believe marshalling a ryker lynch was in the cards but hey thems the breaks.

I see where you're coming from but the problem here was none of the townies really had strong reads. We were all over the place. Pretty much everyone other than me had one vote on them by another player cross voting and I was on NL. If thats not a strong indication that more town voice isn't helping I don't know what is. Townies can be helpful if they have strong reads and good theory to back em up. Here everyone in the town was confused, myself include. Hence why I wanted to push the stats edge, force scum to make a move, and use that info to narrow possibilities.



I realized something was off, but it wasn't enough to make me consider a transcend lynch over any other slot prior to me getting a chance to re-read =(

All 5 of the smashboards players were town and were pretty much all TRing each other. 

Which meant if I didn't do a gambit, I would've lost with ease. 

Mulch played fantastic. I buddied him the whole game because I knew he'd be town read. Considering nomming him for Rising Star award.

Gamma was playing to bait the vig, but it was a day vig. The only way I would've won that is if I bussed him to milk towncred, which I did. 

I didn't want to NL because it would've been hella sus if I didn't die. 

Also I think I was being a bit too manipulative d4 because light caught on for a bit about me setting up a qh.

3187,Mulch,"1. Transcend- Literally an utter god, he carried the scumteam.  He was slick under pressure, crumbed an awesome fakeclaim, was aggresive enough to push for a lynch in MyLo, had great nightkills, and consoled me when I was panicking.  A+++.  Also taught me some things about helping out your scumbuddies; he TR me day 1 without fear and all throughout the end of the game, and we both never died.  
2.  Marshy- You have such a reputation of being a good player that we needed to kill you lol.  We knew youw ould figure us out eventually.  You didn't seem too invested in this game (or maybe that's your playstyle) but you ended up being an early nightkill as VT, which is all you could ask.
3.  Mulch- ME!
4.  LaLaight- A+++ reads, you called out the scumteam way before anyone else and had the guts to do it.  You sort of acted scummy in general as town this game but your logic and reads were on point.
5. Firescreamer- I think that you played fine, I never actually understood why the town wanted to lynch you lol.  I think maybe you could be a bit more confident in game and that would gain you more town cred.
6. Sparkles- You pushed me early!  Very nice game I would say, again I don't know why town didn't like your posts, you were very obv town to me.   Perhaps be a bit more confident. 
7. Zulfy- I really apologize for calling you Wulfy!  I promise it was a 100% tactical move and not anything to personally insult you.  I think you played fine; actually, you scurmead me REALLY early lol.  I don't personally like the +1 things but if it works for you (like it did this game), then good.
8.  Ranmaru- So clearly obvtotwn it hurt, and you stimulated the discussion a LOT.  I think if the town was more active you would have had an even greater effect.  You missed a little on your reads, and sort of fell for my buddying, but tbh you were so obvs town that it dwared any of your downfalls.
9.  FrozenFlame- An amazing strategical and analytical mind, you almost won game for town by going nolynch.  I think that maybe if you went with your gut a little more you would have a ton of success, you seemed to me (at least) to be the smartest person in this game except maybe Transcend.
10.  Ryker- You will see the mafia chat: I said I think you could see right into my soul.  I LOVE your playstyle and aggresiveness!  You stuck with your guts and I think that is such a great thing in other games.  I would be terrified to see you as scum, and I think your pretty smart too.
11. Adumbro- Well, you got Transcend.  I would just say not to underestimate newbies so much! lol.  You did your job, night 1 day kill as VT.  Nothing more you could want.
12. Titus- Tammy- Tammy you were funny and smart, but you had to be replaced.  Titus- maybe don't be so focused on only one set of circumstances, but I can't really blame you there.  to me, you made yourself obvtown when you forget a neighborization, as scum would just make one up.  
13.  Gamma-  NICE PLAY!  I loved your distancing to both me AND transcend; it helped late game.  YOu played the bus just right and helped me out with Transcend day 1.  You also had a cool way of going unnoticed yet seeming to be active that I envy.  Nice!",71796,2017-06-07 00:23:00,3177

Good tactic/gambit and play. Your entrance was bleh but it got better and you tried. Nothing too scummy, you were able to use Gamma to convince me of you being town when you weren't.

LaLight

Hey Lalight. I disagree with you playing so scummy that you get attention towards you. It allowed scum to leave you alive and push for you D4 without any repercussion, even though me giving you suspicion also helped that which is also my bad. I'd rather you lay low and be null or null-town rather than just scummy. Frozen Flame yelled at me though and he disagrees I guess. Still, no reason for you to have a bad entrance as a PR. I also think that you should remain in thread a bit longer. Sometimes you say 'going to sleep' without saying good bye and asking 'hey i'm leaving anyone have any questions before I go?' You kind of plopped a vote on Titus and allowed scum to strike, you should at least have talked to others for thoughts before the day. Honestly you vote too willy nilly in these situations, you did the same thing in D3 bro. Have you ever been in lylo? Pretend you are conf town in lylo, would you want that happening? Anyway, it's cool, I hope you learn to be more cautious with voting in the future. I will give you that you had good night play, you targetted peeps that needed to be targetted. You are cool, sorry if I or others bothered you we kind of scum read you all game haha.

FireScreamer

I want you to try more in future games. I can understand you LAMISTING but that isn't enough. You obviously were not town enough since you were lynched and you seemed like scum just trying to lurk through. If you were more active and contributing more I'd be happy to work with you on your scumreads. Just asking 'anyone voting Lalight?' isn't enough bro. I'm sorry you felt down though, that happens and I hope you feel better next tme.

Agent Sparkles*

I'm sorry I shot you mid-day while you had things to say. What sparked my decision was Lalight coming out, so I wanted to shoot scum to make up for that but I just fucked it up further. As I said in dead thread land, I think your only problem was your schedule. As long as you know to follow up with things then that should be good. I hope you are able to be more active in the future, I know you would be a great asset in the future and I would love to bounce reads with you. I'd prefer to be a VT or neighbor or something instead haha that vig power goes to my head. 

Zulfy

Zulfy I want more from you in your town game, straight up bro. It seems you were procrastinating due to school, and I can understand that. I have been through that, many people have been through that, but you were the D1 lynch because of that. I want you to put in more time into mafia if you can, and stop making ugly ass 1+ posts. Your 1+ thing is cool but please make it neat. Also, if you  have school and time is tight, simply don't play (not being mean here, being realistic). I won't play a game if I don't have time. You need time to be able to play the game well. You were practically almost replaced but for some reason came back and still kind of lurked. I want you to improve on that in the future.

I would have liked to solve things with you more but generally towards the end I was reading you as town. I had no problems with you though, would want you to talk a bit more though. Be a little bit more active. I also wasn't able to really get a bead on you D1 since you were voting my vote. But I can get if you weren't sure who was scum, I wasn't either at that point.

Ryker

Yo, sorry if I frustrated you. I actually was really concerned with you because I was expecting you to be part of the crazy gambit shit as scum but I simply underestimated Transcend here. I've only seen your scum game once. I was making a guess Titus and you were scum together hahaha. Geez I was off. I am glad I was killed because I would have made worse decisions. 

Adum

Sup bro it was fun playing with you as well. Sorry to see you were a bit V/LA but yeah, I have no probs with your play I get it, cards to the chest thing and I respect it. I know you and Marshy are salty about my shot, sorry about that. 

Titus

Thanks for replacing in. I know you don't read much upon replacing in anyway and I considered that risk, since we needed a replacement. Then I started to think you were scum, meh I dunno. Anyway it was fun playing with you. 

Gamma

Lol you won this time! Lmao I guess you did the thing again but this time you didn't just replace in and make it seem all weird. Uh, you just were posting less you didn't even seem to care to find scum at that point. You were just joking around and not doing a thing lol.",71796,2017-06-07 02:02:00,3196

Fun playing with you bro. I see you what you mean with letting the thread breathe. I'll try the 24 hour thing but it's gonna be hard. Not sure I will try it in the large though. I will try it in some other game though. It's like maining a character in melee forever, I can't switch until I train up my other character enough.

Mulch

Good play. I had concerns but you made yourself townier. I'll compare that with your town game. Nothing to critique really, I had the least concerns with you. Also you and Transcend and Gamma posted along with me... which is probably why I should slow down for others. Hehe.",71796,2017-06-07 02:05:00,3197

Thanks Penguin for running it 

I'd have probably never scum read Mulch, he just read so adorably new in his beliefs that I was just like I love his posts.

I'm very sorry for replacing out.  Actually I'm just very sorry for signing up.  I didn't have time; I knew I wouldn't have time and as time was approaching for my championship game I just knew I'd never have time.  I just didn't think it was fair to keep the game hostage when I didn't have a chance to really read the game but for the briefest of skims and there was absolutely no way I'd have had the time to do the game justice.  So, I'm sorry about that.

I enjoyed playing with you guys though.  Ran I hope to play with you again soon.  I signed up to play with you and I'm sorry I just didn't have the time.  I was being serious about that activity meta thing you have on me not being very strong.

Don't shoot. ESPECIALLY don't shoot early or on impulse unless you're shooting a complete inactive.

dude ive seen way too many shitty townreads being thrown out for little reason in the latest meta. it happened in this game and idk why this is a trend. it consistently loses games and its dumb that townies have to fight against haphazard townreads as a regular part of gameplay nowadays. only site ive seen this work out well for town is mafia universe where the gameplay is vastly different and more off the cuff. this was common on swf and i won games as scum all the time cuz of it",71796,2017-06-07 12:31:00,3221

Couldn't agree more. SWF leading up to the creation of Dgames as a separate subforum from Forum Games and then for a couple years thereafter was by far the most competitive mafia community I've ever played in. Not that MS here doesn't have quality players, but on SWF there was very little low level play and thus the overall quality of play was not at all diluted. Unfortunately, just by virtue of the much larger community size here, that dilution phenomenon takes place here and in many other communities.

SWF just had sooooo many heavy hitters and they would always be in games together by virtue of the fact that high level players were the plurality of players. I remember the golden age of Dgames very fondly. So many great personalities with intellect and a competitive mindset to boot. Not all that surprising considering most people who take smash bros games seriously enough to join and actively post on a site devoted almost entirely to competitive play are going to bring that same mindset to mafia. The nature of smashboards itself was self selecting for people who enjoy learning games with depth and take playing to wincon seriously.",71796,2017-06-07 23:45:00,3235

3256,nancy,"FLAVORSpoiler: Day 1 nancy smiles up at the sky for a moment as she leaves her apartment building. The color of morning has everything lit up and sparkling and the smell of purple hyacinth carries her out into the side street. She taps out a message on her phone keyboard as she strolls down along the vacant sidewalk with her bag slung over one shoulder, Am otw!.
A few blabbering tourists crowd around the barred gates to Casa di Giulietta. The way becomes still busier once nancy reaches the piazza beyond. Local women dressed in all manner of color and fashion hurry this way and that with their eyes buried in smartphone screens.
Someone curses at themselves sheepishly and appears without recourse when they stumble on a curb and spill their takeaway coffee onto their hand. nancy's phone comes to life in her coat pocket with a message: Hurrry uuuuuuppp.
nancy ducks into a bar for a moment to snatch an angel wing and a coffee before continuing on her way. /me licks, she sends. The pastry melts against her tongue as she rounds a corner and she nearly sags against the wall for a moment under the effect of the sugar.
nancy's phone buzzes mutely against her hip. She purrs at the sight of the little words on the screen: Would be perfect if I only had something fuzzy in my lap to cuddle right now. Her response is a jumble of cat emoji and meowing. Another message pops up as she crosses the piazza under the watch of Torre dei Lamberti.
nancy there are flights on sale to GÃ¶teborg!
YESSSSSSSS OMG WHEN BUY THEM BUY THEM. The thought of going back to Sweden makes nancy's toes curl. That was where everything had started....
A bird perches on a balcony railing above nancy takes into flight at the sight of a possible mate, and nancy's phone screen glows with the winding back-and-forth between her and her lover as she cuts across the city.
Umm would you be mad at me if I told you I ate the last of the chocolate last night? ;~;
Mini puts her phone aside for a moment to stare up at the ceiling, trying intently to calm her fidgeting. She's been lying on her bed for over an hour with the pillows gathered around her, spamming nancy's phone with messages and never receiving enough in reply. The incense on her dresser has died, but she hasn't noticed. She's too wrapped up in her impatience, waiting for nancy to arrive while warding off the swells of pain coursing up her back through to her forehead.

The distance between their houses is easily walkable, but the amount of time it takes to travel when there is nothing else to focus on drives Mini to rearranging the bed in every manner possible. After tossing the triangular pillow back against the head of the bed once again, she switches to Skyscanner app at a whim and checks for flights to Sweden. A moment later she flurries through a jumble of texts to nancy, only the first coming through with proper diction: nancy there are flights on sale to GÃ¶teborg!

In the brief surge of excitement at reading the message, nancy stops watching the path for just long enough to collide with a woman hurrying out of a store bearing a carrybag full of groceries nestled in the crook of her elbow. The force of the impact sends the bag swinging and its contents half-spill out onto the stone paving: several tomatoes, a punnet of strawberries, an orange, and a jar of pickles. The jar shatters and spews pickle and preservative across nancy's textile shoes.
Spoiler: Day 2 The sun is climbing high enough over old, red-topped Verona to begin to fill the sky. The soft glow that filters through the clouds embarks upon its slow journey of clearing the dampness of the city streets. On Via Pillicciai, nancy glances regretfully at the closed doors of Come una Volta as she passes the gelateria at a brisk walk. She now has a new route to Mini's house, detouring by Via Mazzini on account of Mini's evening snacking habits, nevermind her shoes being completely ruinedâ€”the smell of pickle drags itself around with her everywhere, a plague upon her and anyone else with a sensitive enough sense of smell to catch the odor. The streets are steadily filling and motorbikes have begun zipping by with increasing frequency. Here and there a little pool of water that has collected over the course of the night is dispersed across the pavement, and nancy more than once has to predict the movement of traffic to avoid being sprayed.

She finishes typing another messageâ€”an incoherent jumble of lovehearts and smileysâ€”and sends it to Mini. A ray of light burns through a window (she thinks for a moment that it is the sun) and she squints against it as she moves to retrieve her sunglasses from her bag. The sound of traffic becomes unbearable as a truck trundles by, running through a puddle and sending a slur of muck in nancy's direction. She dodges backwards instinctively at the sound of wheel hitting water, twisting her body away from the turbulence of brownish liquid in her periphery, and trips over a terrier squatting patiently by its leash. For a moment the ground seems to be surging unstoppably up towards her, before it falters and halts and she realizes that she has caught herself with one hand gripping the flat stone of the building, and is stumbling to regain her balance. She forgets that the dog exists as she recovers shiveringly from the panic of the near-fall, starts once again down the street at a stilted gait, and stares without recognition at the pair of blue sunglasses in her hand, frame and lens crumpled and cracked from their meeting with the wall.
Um can go by Venchi to get more if you want? She slides the phone back into her jacket pocket just as a motorbike passes her. The man riding it calls out to her, bella gnocca!, and is taken around a corner. She spits his compliment into the pavement without breaking stride.
Somewhere nearby there is a cello playing, accompanied by clarinet and bassoon. The cello moves into recitative, and nancy glides across the intersection. Her phone hums silently as she passes under the building where she and her first girlfriend used to live, a small flat with a bedroom that always caught the afternoon sun in such a way to divide the room into two neat halves, one shimmering with thousandfold delight and the other cold and withdrawn.
nancy pictures herself at Mini's as she continues down the tunnel: she combs her fingers through Mini's hair, feels the tug of every strand and the soft surface of her scalp, and holds herself close to her body in search of her heartbeat as they lie in bed together watching a film (Kyss Mig, probably), surrounded by pillows and blankets and chocolate and incense. The imagined scene is so familiar it feels almost a memory. She quickens her step.
nancy glows as she walks by a lesbian couple locked in passionate embrace against the glass of a new dining establishment. The patrons on the interior side of the window gesticulate and shout noiselessly at the intrusion.
The wind picks up abruptly as nancy crosses the intersection coming out of the tunnel. Her hair blows across her face and blinds her until she can arrest it with her free hand. After getting it back under control on the safety of the sidewalk, she pulls it up and draws the elastic from her wrist to secure it in place. Just as she is tugging her hair through a second time there is a dull snap and the elastic comes loose in her fingers. Shit hot mess, she mutters. Now how I am going to keep my head tonight?

She fumbles with her smartphone. None of the buttons seem to cooperate at first, then she realizes that she's not using an iPhone anymore. You got elastic babe mine broke just now >_>
Spoiler: Day 3 A flush of emotion begins to bleed through nancy as she rounds the corner onto Via Catullo. The narrow laneway is mostly devoid of pedestrians and only a few vehicles occasion it. The storied buidlings that rise over the sidestreet give it a feeling of secluded privacy that is further heightened by immaculate display niches punctuating the walls. She walks in silence and touches the small posts that line the sidewalk, grazing her palm over the rounded tops in a daydream. The rhythm of her lover's voice in her mind carries her down the street as the slow crescendo of desire - for chocolate and for sex - overwhelms her in its swell.

How long can it take to reach the damn chocolate store.... I hate detours!
I missss youuuuu. I swear I'm having nance-withdrawal symptoms right now. Where are youuu??
Past the spotty yellow facades, the red clay walls and the ornate doors, under shuttered windows and the overhanging balconies with their sharp, black railing, by the display fronts and the little poles marking the way safe for pedestrians, nancy closes in on the intersection of Via Catullo and Mazzini. She mulls over all the variety of flavors of chocolate as she walks, in anticipation of reaching Venchi, and fails to notice her phone making a fuss in her coat pocket. As she reaches the intersection, she notices two women, dressed identically, in a heated discussion with a man by the corner. Their dispute abruptly descends into shouting, with the man braying that his rights and men's rights all over the world are being violating, that he is a victim of oppression in a culture ""dominated by female manipulation"". Tears begin rolling down his cheeks as the couple spit at his feet, turn heel and walk away. Ever a tourist of misandry and male tears, nancy savors the sight for a moment before moving on. Venchi, sweet heaven of chocolates, awaits.
Spoiler: Day 4 nancy stands at the entrance to Venchi for a moment, savoring the smell of chocolate wafting out from within. Customers mill around inside the store, indecisive and desperate. She types out another message to Mini at the threshold consisting of love hearts and a variety of chocolate-y emoji, then puts her phone back into her coat pocket and moves to step inside. A customer comes barrelling out the store just as she does, carrying hot chocolate somewhere in an explicable rush. The woman suddenly trips and falls, and her drink goes flying. The liquid streams onto nancy's coat in a hot, dark mess. She stares at her coat for a moment in disbeliefâ€”the pink, white and orange Ida Klamborn she bought back when she and Mini were traveling Sweden and falling in love with the country. Then at the woman lying, sprawled out on the pavement, with grazes on her arms.

First my shoes, then my sunglasses, now my coat.... Fuck! This couldn't get any worse!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I'm comingggggggg sowwies ;~;
A moment of remembrance abruptly falls upon nancy as she waits her turn in Venchi with the stain of chocolate drying into her coat. She is reading the news on her phone and happens upon a piece describing the death of a man in the UK who had apparently been a serial online stalker. She notices by the pictures that he looks eerily similar to the photos she was sent by that creep who followed her across the Internet last year.

It had taken removing herself from social media and removing every trace of herself from the public that was she was able to finally begin to feel safe from him. How many emails had he sent her begging for attention, promising himself to her? How many times had he stalked her from one site to the next, somehow always managing to know her movements, for months invading her private life and never giving her a moment of peace?

And now he has apparently been murdered by one of the women he was stalking on and off for over four years. It is a horrible crime, but her feelings upon discovering the articleâ€”seeing his picture and reading his name over to herself to dispel her doubtâ€”is sheer relief. The moment passes and the memory of everything he has done to her empties completely from her mind. Her demeanor brightens with the knowledge that her persecutor now pays his dues in hell.
Spoiler: Day 5 The first time Mini and I kissed was in Gothenburg, outside the airport. It wasn't at all romantic on reflection, but it was so new that it kind of felt that way at the time. I remember it being a cool dayâ€”it was springâ€”with the sun out and I remember her wearing a blue and white polkadot dress and that her hair was done up in an elaborate braid that had partially come apart at the seams over the course of the flight. I'd warned her not to nap but she fell asleep anyway. I don't think she could help it, really. When we landed and got off the plane we were both so damn happy to be in Sweden finally that the wait for our baggage was the scarcely bareable peak of a crescendo that would only find release in the outdoors. We were stuck in international limbo, breathing in the stale air of disinfectant and airconditioning, with the actual Sweden, the fresh, oceanic air, still waiting for us, just out beyond the glass exit doors.

And when we made it outside there wasn't much else to do, really. We led our bags off the way and ran a circle then we were in each others arms hugging and she kissed my lids and my cheek then she kissed my lips and I was so completely gone from the bliss of it that there's just no way for me to ever forget that soft and elusive feeling of connectedness that I've since developed an addiction for or the flight leading up to it or the way that she smelled of lilac and the way that the outside smelled of dew and pollen and hibiscus (although the hibiscus may have just been someone walking by with a bouquet).

Do you remember our first kiss babe?
I think so yes!
When was it? I'm trying to remember and I can't ;~;
I think it was in GÃ¶teburg?
Really? Like the first time?
Yesss. At the airport
Ughh why can't I fucking remember :(
Inside Venchi, the neat displays of chocolate and the scent of cocoa and nut promptly melt nancy's resolve. She pounces on several items at once and carries them all to the counter: truffles, chocolate fingers, bars of dark and extra dark, plain, cherry-infused, with hazelnut, with chocolate filling, with caramelized orange, with chili and salt flakes. The pile fits neatly into a cute carrybag dressed in an ornate ""V"". She exits the heady ambience of the store, pursued by a sense of lingering regret.
nancy leaves Venchi and takes down Via Mazzini in a hurry, ignoring all the luxury shopping stores, thinking only of Mini's arms and lips. Tourists mill about outside the storefronts, peering in at the wares indecisively and gabbing with each other in foreign languages.

There are things that I'd like to be doing to you right now and you not being here is reaaally unhelpful.
I AM TRYING TO HURRY OKAY ;~;

The street turns into Piazza Bra and the arena, in full first-century splendor, overwhelms the scene. Cars and motorbikes busy the wide road and umbrellas tucked obediently into their sheaths decorate the sidewalk by the outdoor seating of restaurants and cafes. She turns quickly onto Piazzetta Rubiani then Via Cattaneo and is once more relatively alone on the late-morning sidestreet among the cracking paint of old walls and wire-hanging lamps. She sticks her hand into her coat pocket as the moves around a woman talking on her phone in a morning gown outside her door and feels the prick of an object she did not know was there.

She pulls the object out and realizes that it is the silver necklace with a half-moon pendant given to her by her first girlfriend all those years ago. nancy wonders for a moment whether her ex still has its twin, the other half of the moon, then lifts the lid of a garbage bin as she passes and drops the necklace inside.
Spoiler: Day 6 We were out in the woods and we'd been making out for a while by the fireplace and she â€”.

Do you at least remember.... our first time?
No ;~;
....
A calico skitters out of nancy's way when she rounds the corner suddenly. She wilts in a moment of nostalgia over Summer, her own six year-old calico, who she had to leave in the care of friends when she left Sweden for Verona and MiniDeathStar.
She can still smell the chocolate as she makes the next blockâ€”only four more to Mini's placeâ€”and it only makes her salivating worse. /me has hungries
nancy rounds the corner to Mini's place. The street is in a state of relative quiet, and she begins to hurry with impatience. When she reaches the apartment door, she suddenly becomes aware that she no longer has her clutch with her. She checks herself in confusion for a moment and unpacks the carrybag full of chocolate before sighing with the realization that she must have left it back at Venchi. God fucking damn why has this has been such an awful morning?! She pulls out her phone and calls Mini to ask her to come down for her. She cries out as a sudden cramp crushes her and she curls up for a moment in an unsuccessful attempt to bear the pain.

Mini stutters in disbelief as she opens the door and sees the state her girlfriend is in. nancy breaks down with a desperate sob and buries her overflow of tears in Mini's shoulder.
First my FAVORITE PAIR OF SHOES, (Keyser SÃ¶ze, the pair of vegan, textile designer flats that she wears around the streets of Verona) got fucking ruined by a jar of pickles OF ALL THINGS.

Then my SUNGLASSES, (implosion, the pair of blue sunglasses with red-green-white patterning she bought from Agatha Ruiz de la Prada last Spring) which I loved and were fucking awesome, got CRUSHED against the wall because of that fucking rodent dog.

And after that my HAIR ELASTIC (Desperado, a simple thick black rubber hair band from the department store) snapped for no god damn reason and unless you have a decent one for me to use I have no way to keep my head tonight or I have to go all the way across town to get one.

At least I did get to see that god awful MRA PEDESTRIAN (Leonshade, an unmemorable men's rights activist who invariably nauseates women with his mansplaining and victim complex) take a beatdown from that lesbian couple. That was admittedly pretty delightful and enjoyed that for a good bit.

Except that the next thing I know my DESIGNER COAT (Aristophanes, the pink, white and orange coat she bought from Ida Klamborn when she and Mini were traveling together) got fucking destroyed by chocolate because that fucking girl can't watch where she's walking and had to spill her shit all over it. FUCK.

I did learn that my fucking ONLINE STALKER (camn, that fucking creeper she made the mistake of adding to social media last year who won't let up following her across the whole of the world wide web) got.... murdered.... which was.. good.. I guess. Fuck. I mean, that was a relief in a way?

But then the next thing I know I can't even remember our FIRST KISS (Nachomamma8, the memory of the kiss she shared with Mini outside the airport in Gothenburg), which is so fucking unbelievable that I tossed my ex's HALF-MOON NECKLACE (Titus, the necklace her first girlfriend gave her years ago for their first anniversary that she thought she had lost) into a random garbage bin on the way here and apparently also could not even remember my FIRST ORGASM WITH YOU, (Tammy, her memory of the first time she came in Mini's bed, eight days after they met) which just makes me hate myself completely because how the fuck can you forget that memory???? OF ALL THINGS.

Clearly I just have a fucking shit and worthless memory because I also forgot my CLUTCH PURSE, (Firebringer, the small, flame-red clutch adorned with four purple hearts that holds all her most valuable personal items, such as mace) at Venchi when I left there with the chocolate....

~

Mini pats nancy's hair as she recounts again the misfortunes she has suffered over the past hour or so on the way over when nancy suddenly tears herself away angrily and hurls her SMARTPHONE (Ginngie, the S8 she's been using the past two months to spam Mini with emoji and questionnaires) against the near wall. She screams sadly as fragments of smartphone explode against the wall, then glares in hysteria at Mini, pulls her VIAL OF MALE TEARS (Infinity 324, a small glass vial filled with every lesbian's most nutritious and savored meal.... may they never stop flowing) from her coat pocket and drains it onto the floor.

She doubles over in pain and seems on the brink of losing her balance as her PERIOD PAIN (Ser Arthur Dayne, the cramps that completely wreck her existence for several days each month) courses along her spine and through to the tips of her fingers and toes, quickly overwhelming and encompassing her entire body. Mini starts towards her hesitantly, with one arm outstretched, offering to help her upstairs to the apartment.

I think implosion's opening approach to Tammy seemed genuine - I don't think that he as scum walks into a circle jerk with the ""I wish you got town this game"" he did initially, I think he's more cautious about referring to history (aka makes sure it actually exists first), I don't think he presses Alisae to vote him as he has here.

Gin I liked that he immediately poked at Tammy and I not interacting - he knows we play a lot together, it makes sense for him as town to zero in on that whereas he might be more focused on giving a more believable read as scum.

Firebringer just looks town - nothing specific, mostly a feeling, but legitimate for early game reads.",71697,2017-05-03 00:29:00,121

I have given reads that have nothing to do with meta - I'm not voting you because you're outside the circle (which should be obvious - I townread implosion for him having an opposite reaction to my circle jerk).

I can very much see this reaction being within his scum range and it seems way too overdone to be coming from town - a bit of initial frustration or an offhanded complaint okay but the 10+ ""he dropped his town tell"" posts based on one comment from me seems excessive.",71697,2017-05-03 00:34:00,139

Nacho isn't arrogant at all.  He gets confident about his reads sometimes, but is not unwilling to listen to another point of view.  He has never insulted another persons intelligence because that is just not him as a person.  People are going to disagree, and sometimes people are going to seem strong about it, but it doesn't mean they're always wrong.  Nacho is right a lot of the time.

I don't think it's really helpful to shut down or throw people's wrongness in their face from another game in a current game.  It does nothing to help advance the game state, nor does it help solve the game.  If you have specific reasoning for why you think nacho is wrong, talk about that because that can be helpful and will go much farther in helping to solve the game and not create or further animosity

My follow-up to that was rhetoric - I disagreed with the point you were making, and I responded in that way to emphasize my disbelief - I know that wasn't the thought process you were having, and I'm sorry that I implied that it was but I only meant to do so as a rhetorical point and I didn't mean for it to be a commentary on your intelligence at all.",71697,2017-05-03 02:30:00,426

Boon being like ""Lol I'm town"" then ""Wait, what does a Desperado do?"" and then ""Okay, you die"" is fake and scummy and it needs rope. That transition makes no sense at all.

I give a shit. The more I give a shit, less likely the person is scum.

The less I give a shit, the more likely they are scum.

You'll understand this. Pine, didn't give a shit(was scum), Persivual, knew he was posting, didn't give a shit and ignored(until I didn't), implosion, I ignored and didn't give a shit, once I did, he was scum.

Knowing how I generally work, I'm focusing on narrowing down on who catches my eye, once I get down to a reasonable amount of people who I still seem to ignore, imma pounce.

This also has the reverse affect of sub-consciously making the scum being hyper-aware and I can take note of any changes in behaviour up to this point.

One thing i haven't put down to paper yet is that I wanted to track how you reacted to votes onto you, thus why I told Nacho I was simply waiting on you to respond when he said I would have said something to if I truly had something to say. If I spoiled what I was looking for, you, if scumz would react different, wouldn't be raw data.

3856,Nachomamma8,"@Boonskiies -

First of all, I think that one of your major sticking points against Alisae is the way he's going about pushing you; I do agree that his reasoning for pushing you in general is weird as shit (saying that you're defending Frog and using that as a significant point against you when you're not defending Frog), but I'm having trouble seeing scum go so absolutely hard against you early game, especially when no one else is buying the push - the frustration here and here when it seems no one is buying into the push also seems pretty genuine to me. Him being scum here would require him being so desperate to get you lynched where he's willing to lie and throw fake tantrums to get you lynched, which doesn't really make sense to me. I think that it's more likely he's just town who got a bit overzealous with his read.

I also don't really get why Alisae as scum would move from Frogger to you if he were scum. If Alisae is scum and Frogger is town, then he has a perfectly acceptable mislynch wagon to sit on and moving from that to you (a read no one is really buying into and a read that's getting him scumread by multiple people) doesn't seem like it's in his best interests. If he is scum with Frogger, then I find the early mutual push kind of strange - I can see them maybe agreeing to push each other pregame but if that was the case, then I think Frogger would be pushing back more (this interaction looks more like Alisae pushing him and him rolling over).

3865,Nachomamma8,"@Alisae - 

I don't really understand why you went from pushing Frog to Boonskies (and later implosion, but that seemed like it was more out of frustration than anything - correct me if I'm wrong). I don't think it's fair to say that Boonskies is hard defending Frogger; you seem to assume that from his 353 which I don't really understand - his only point was that he also has experience with Frog, it had nothing to do with whether he thought your experience was legitimate or not. Boonskiies's attack on you asking Gin to vote Frog just seems like a misunderstanding - I interpreted it as you trying to get a wagon on Frog early so you could read him but he seemed to read it as you trying to get Gin to vote Frog with absolutely no reasoning. Am I missing something with your push on him here?

As far as why I think he's town this game, I really liked this post for starters. I expected him to read people based on their pushes on him based on his perception of himself here, and the ""I even gave you an out"" post seemed like a smooth confidence that seemed unlikely to be coming from scum who was caught pretty much immediately and the sarcastic rebuttal of your suspicions in 327 and 328 also seemed town along that same vein. 

I also think that his suspicion on you makes a lot of sense: 313 picks up on the ""OR ELSE"" phrasing and calls you hypocritical for expecting an explanation from Frog when you haven't really explained your Frog read itself (understandable, a large part of confidence in your read on him is due to meta so it makes sense for someone to struggle to understand the push from an outside perspective), 323 is an attack founded by him having a different definition from the word ""sort"" than you do (""you're not reading me"" is not necessarily the same as ""you don't have a read on me"" but a nuanced difference that isn't immediately noticeable), his 420 expresses that he doesn't like you accusing him of defending Frogger when that's not at all what he's doing (I agree with this - just because he disliked a certain push doesn't immediately mean he's defending the person you're pushing).",71697,2017-05-03 13:41:00,611

I voted implosion for this, but it was a tongue in cheek vote; I had a different read on Tammy than he did but that had nothing to do with my read on him. I liked his read on me here but my townread on him didn't coalesce until this exchange; his position on Tammy seemed town to me because he was putting unreasonable pressure on someone who wasn't going to be a likely mislynch and I didn't think he'd do that as scum since he'd probably be expecting pushback from it which I don't think that he would be comfortable with.

From there, my read on him has only strengthened - this post adds a nuance to the Alisae scumread that I don't think he'd think to fake as scum, this post I'm probably townreading more than I should but it came after he voted Frogger immediately after I was thinking of asking him what he thought of Frogger, then thought to myself ""man, if he's scum here I'm going to cry"" and then refreshed the page and hey here's him with a similar read on me - I know it's not an insane thing to fake as scum and could be entirely coincidental but the feeling of being so perfectly in sync is too strong to shake, and the way his Alisae read is developing also seems genuine.

3880,Nachomamma8,"@Hikari Link: I'm splitting my reads into three posts; townreads, reads I have no idea about, Frogger. I've tried to avoid talking about meta when able to but it's inevitably made it into a couple of reads that I just can't separate it from - let me know if this is helpful at all.

{Tammy, Implosion, Boonskiies, Alisae}
{Firebringer, Aristophanes}

I think that Tammy's town looks posting in a vacuum but a large part of my confidence in her being town is due to meta; she's the player I'm the most familiar with in this playerlist by far and we've been playing together for a while and while meta tells can absolutely be wrong I don't think this one is. The posting that I think looks town regardless of meta is how she's working through reading people while still messing around and having fun - every read she's given makes sense and has nuance. 

I thought that Implosion's push on Tammy looked town. Part of thinking that looks town is also due to meta - Tammy has been playing for years and has never been mislynched and had an opening that I thought looked pretty town - I don't think that implosion as scum would decide to push Tammy as the first significant thing that he did in the game (especially for reasoning as shaky as ""you haven't towntold in your first post""), but it makes a lot of sense for him to push her a bit prematurely because he wasn't townreading her yet and was used to townreading her instantly. I also agree with and can understand exactly where all of his reads are coming from; his stance on rb is complicated for scum faking a read and reflects my early perspective perfectly, and I think that his reasons for starting to scumread Alisae make a lot of sense, as do his reasons for wanting to hold onto that scumread - the way he sort of lets the read fizzle out as he inevitably loses confidence in it anyways also seems very genuine. 

The towniest part of Boonskiies's play is how he's handling Alisae's push on him; posts like this where he's saying ""I gave you a chance to survive but you fucked up, time for you to die"" is some pretty smooth confidence as scum, posts like this where he says that he was waiting for Alisae to vote him also look very genuine and make sense when a big part of the reason he suspects Alisae is Alisae's push on him, and posts like this also just seems like a townie who feels confident that he caught scum. It also helps quite a bit that he's pushing Alisae for very legitimate reasons (I talked about where I think he's going wrong a bit in my response to Alisae, I can go through their exchanges again if that's something you were interested in). Him having legitimate reasons to back up his confidence helps with townreading him because it makes it less likely that he's just going attacking Alisae because there's suspicion surrounding him and he thinks pressing someone hard will make him look town. 

I'm townreading Alisae mostly because I don't think his play here makes a whole lot of sense from a scum perspective. I don't think that it makes scum to push Frog as hard as he was and then swap to Boonskies shortly after, but I can understand town who gets overzealous based on someone actively making posts that they disliked. I also think that his reads (for the most part) make sense - even his Boonskiies read which bothers me the most out of everything that he's done started out pretty reasonably before going off the rails later. Examples of reads that I think look genuine include his early implosion read: it looked kind of strange that he was pressing implosion but not voting him early on but then he explained that he didn't understand what implosion was doing but thought it was an odd thing for him to do as scum, which mirrored my thoughts on implosion at the time. I liked his read on Frog here. It, of course, helps that I share the Frog scumread, but I also liked how the attack started out very confident and ended with ""I think you might be scum here"" - I can definitely see feeling great about something in the moment but then losing confidence before you actually submit the post and don't think it's a detail that Alisae as scum puts in if the motivation here is to go bananas on Frogger to look town.

I think Firebringer could be town because it doesn't look like he's trying to get townread in any way at all - his scumread on implosion is based on one post, he has a scumread on Alisae also based on nothing, and very very blatantly rolefishes in thread. He might be scum who thinks that he can get away with it because ""lol firebringer"" and I don't really have any reason to believe that he isn't, just kind of gut reading him as town here.

I think Aristophanes could be town because he hates being scum and I don't think he'd open up with pushing me. This is not a very strong reason for him being town.

So right now, I feel okay about the top four being town - Tammy in particular I feel surprisingly confident about but every other read I wouldn't be horribly surprised if I was wrong with (I'd think they were playing a good game of course, but it wouldn't be a huge huge surprise), they just feel pretty town right now.

I don't think that it's intuitive for scum to blast multiple people as hard as Alisae did out of the gate and then fake being upset because no one is listening to you.

I actually had a gut feeling from Alisae, its not based on nothing. He is acting very like how I expect out of his scum play. I don't say anything more because Alisae will immediately discredit it because ""fire bringer is always paranoid of me"" Which is half accurate, and I think he already did.

Implosion first post about Tammy was so scummy, that wasn't nothing.
His back and forth with Tammy was bad too, but not as bad as the initial post.

Also yes, I would blatantly rosefish as scum. I wasn't honestly role fishing I was just pretending I was. I made up a ""Rb is crumbing Jailkeeper"" to see how he would react. Not sure what to think of his reaction, I am wondering why he is so nice to Titus this game.

This is last post i respond to until i seriously try to block ms for the day to get stuff done:

Nacho-Feels townie. He isn't doing anything I expect him to do, he is engaged with everyone, theres no hold backs form anything he is saying or doing. Like theres more of a 'in control' vibe you get when you see between nacho town and scum. I am not feeling it here yet. It was harder to tell right in RVS because the playfulness but i feel he is townie.

Tammy-Unsure. I will be honest, everyone says Tammy is super fricking easy to read and I have never understood it. Anyone who people say is easy to read I fail almost 80% of the time. She seems to be enjoying herself and relaxed which apparently is her town tells but she also lately seems to have gotten better at enjoying scum so that could mean nothing. Overall hope she keeps up the fun, i don't like seeing her hate games she plays in. I said a lot without giving a read, so I am just saying Optimistic Town, but it is still null.

Implosion-I felt was more scummy and I explained it before. Its 629 and 630",71697,2017-05-03 16:35:00,636
3891,Nachomamma8,"@Hikari Link, this is my second reads post talking about reads that I'm still working through.

I'm probably coming around to a townread on Gin. It does look like he's genuinely trying to read me through posts like 19 (which I lean town on because of the whole ""unreasonable expectations thing"" I talked about with my townread on implosion) and here where he questions my early activity even though not really thinking it makes me more likely to be scum. I'm inclined to read him for wacky shit like this post, where not pushing implosion today is apparently a gambit or this post where he's crumbed something to me or this ""I don't give a shit about them or I do give a shit about them"" separation + ""I'm scumreading Tammy because my reasons for townreading her aren't deep enough"" wacky shit combo but I'm far more comfortable reading him on the reads he's formed and decided to push and he just hasn't really gotten into that a whole lot yet.

Titus I just don't really have a read on right now. I had some concerns early mostly because I wasn't really sure where she was coming from and she was poking at a dynamic that felt off to her in a way that was more laid-back then I was expecting and then I ended up liking her responses to that but not in a way where I could feel so much as vaguely confident about a read there. I think pressing a scum read based on a contradiction that's not a contradiction is something she's capable of doing as either alignment.

---

I'm not really sure what to make of rb. His interactions with me bother me for reasons that I'd rather not get into, but at a minimum, I'm annoyed that he played one game with me 6 months ago and assumes he knows everything about me and I'm not worth interacting as a result, and I'm still trying to figure out whether I think that conclusion is genuine when he didn't bring up any of that frustration in the game in question.

I think his perspective on Frogger seems genuine; I'm not sure he'd be going to bat for a scumbuddy who hadn't done anything yet, and the way he presents his reasoning here like it's immediately going to be discredited seems genuine to me. His most recent point on Alisae (dropping strong Frogger meta scumread to push Boonskiies) is not bad at all and is easily the one thing about Alisae that bothers me. 

His interactions with Titus also look genuine enough and the things he's doing in general don't really look like things scum would do (in particular things like the self-vote and sheeping Titus stuff). If I didn't have the interactions stuff to parse through I'd be much more comfortable slotting him as town and he might just be town but as of right now I'm more comfortable leaving a bunch of question marks around him.

If I was forced to read you/Keyser I'd call you town and Keyser scum because the way you're trying to get a handle on the game seems kind of genuine to me and Keyser complaining and disappearing immediately doesn't but that's less than nothing type of reasoning.",71697,2017-05-03 16:44:00,637

3894,Nachomamma8,"@Hikari Link: This is my scumread on Frogger. A good chunk of my confidence in the read is because of meta (I wouldn't feel it was anything more than a decent RVS vote otherwise), but I've done my best to explain context and where I'm coming from below; let me know if anything needs to be clarified. 

First of all, in a vacuum, I feel like Frogger's posts aren't great. Voting Alisae is fine, but if it was a strong read like he claims it is in this post, I'd imagine he'd care a bit more about explaining it. Showing up and caring about nothing but the votecounts in this and this post while people are pushing a case on him and things are happening around him just feels unnatural.

The reason why meta makes this a read I feel somewhat confident about is because I've found that, in general, he'd rather be town than scum and it shows and I've also found that as town he's not inclined to let people just push him - he doesn't like being misunderstood and he generally feels very town when he's town and so usually struggles to see why people would suspect him. If you look through the first page of his ISO around this post, you'll see him responding to suspicion on him and pushing back a bit in a way that is much much different than how he's handling it here.

In Laundry Mafia, for example, Frogger played with Tammy and I and opened the game up in the same sort of way that we opened here; he was playful, he was active, he developed multiple reads and pushed them pretty much instantly.

There's also games like this one, where he was very busy but still managed to take point in a hydra and certainly didn't let the suspicion surrounding him stand while he flaked out of his scumgame that was going on at the same time.

I don't think that this is slam dunk reasoning or anything (it's possible that Frogger is town doing a weird gambit, it's possible he's just busy and not letting us know he is for some reason) and I think he's more than capable of faking the differences I pointed out in these game, but I think that him not liking scum as much as he likes town means that it's possible he's more inclined to have an opening like this when scum.",71697,2017-05-03 17:19:00,640

My personal to do list.

Nacho is my bae and if we are going to do a break the game 1, I need to have him as a town read or I'm fukt. Nacho should also be able to sort out Tammy(I mean they're dating so I think they know each other's play down pat) and Nacho is the only one I saw in the sign up threads welcoming Hikari so Nacho will be a great source of information on that slot

Titus I can't read for shite

Boon I just recently played with and I'll be experimenting with him to see if I can crack a town!tell out of him or not.

Fire I remember calling out Nacho's shit before and I also (you know this) get antsy about the slot as the game goes on.

rb apparently he's cool as town, could chill with Alisae insight.

Ari and Frogger, seen their scum game, it's literally not posting at all. They sort themselves.

Now here's the fun part. 

I'm in one of the neighborhoods this game. I have my personal read of not lynching Implosion due to our interactions in the pre-game. 

I also have the theory that one of the neighborhoods that exist have one scum butt in it. 

Now, for why I don't want him lynched D1? It's so that if he's scum, I can spot bullshit a mile away and can tell he's playing me. That and the fact that if he's scum, I can work out who is scum given a flip and god forbid a town and town neighborhood because I do respect his play. 

Now, the crumb I was telling you about was convoluted but what it derives from is your post here:


You liked to vote town, so this game, I tried to signal that I was under similar conditions you were under that game.

In that game, your condition was you had a neighborhood, or the rogue crew, and you would have also a PT with BBmolla after you died if I didn't vanillize him but not sure you payed that much attention.

As for you, and the list the arrows are indicating that I can trust a read you give on Tammy if you're town, I have my own but you have a strong opinion there as well. As for Hikari, he's the only one I don't really know about besides Keely, and when in the sign up threads, you said hi to him and welcome back, so i took that as a signal that you knew how he played, or at least had a valid opinion.

Normally I'm all cool and the gang about leaving my rvs a bit longer, but recent games says oh hell no if implosion is at l-2.

I do want to address the town tell issue because I think it's been misunderstood





Implosion wasn't saying he has a specific town tell for me; he was saying that in our past games he's been able to easily read me as town because I've town told in my first few posts.  Meaning I've made obviously town posts early on.  

He doesn't need to have seen me as scum before to think he can easily read me as town because I town tell in my early posts.  He thought I could be scum early on because he didn't think he saw what he was used to seeing when I've been town previously.  That's just scum hunting.

(It really only becomes problematic if he thinks his reasoning for town reading me is so strong or right that he isn't willing to entertain the possibility I could be scum posting in the way I do as town in order to get town read.)

In short he doesn't have a town tell for me.

I don't think his interaction with me or nacho was off at all.  In several games in the past we've both been able to town read each other early and have interacted in much this same way.",71697,2017-05-03 17:55:00,664

I actually dont like implosion that much considering one key thing I picked up on in his word choice this game.

Spoiler:  



The main thing that concerns me is how he stating his reads. I just recently played a game with him, like a week ago, where he was scum and he always had this sentence structure of being uber confident and ""would be surprised"" if his reads were wrong.

What also pings is how looking at the out of game quotes, those are in posts 1100 something and then 2500, in LyLo or day before.

You are so impatient XD",71697,2017-05-03 18:05:00,672
3927,Fro99er,"First of all -- pregame -- I was asked by nancy not to spam or post way too much.  Anyway, I came to realize nancy wasn't just asking me, but asked everyone (I responded to nancy that I didn't like her assuming I would just spam this game...then she replied she sent it to everyone). That was confirmed in Alisae's first post (post 33) when Alisae said we were on a mission not to spam. So I'm trying to see if that's something I can actually do -- not post too much.

Even in my scum games I post a TON (Alisae will take note that I didn't post in our hydra game where we rolled scum, but I have a history of not posting in hydras as both alignments if I can't get into the game. In that game I really didn't want to play with ThinkBig -- who had just game thrown in Cabd's game -- and I signed up first then ThinkBig signed up and I didn't have a chance to tell Alisae I wanted out before the game started. Alisae convinced me to stay in, but I never posted but once until LyLo when I started fake posting as Alisae). 

I can link to multiple town and scum games where I just don't post in hydra, plus a third party game -- again...all as hydrae.

But when I roll scum solo, I post a fuckton. Need an example -- go see HoH where I was scum but still posted a shit ton, or my recent scum game with Eddie which was moderated by Ari: viewtopic.php?f=83&t=70624&activity_overview=1&sort_type=pc&sort_order=d

Anyway -- this is all setting up my points...

My first real scumread was Alisae, because I felt like Alisae was hopping on the convenient scumread of Implosion in 79. It came on the heels of Fire (post 56), rb (post 61), nacho (post 64) and Tammy (post 66) all either scumreading or being confused by Implosion's approach to the game around Tammy not towntelling yet. It just seemed weird.

Then Alisae continues to press the angle a bit (when I think, if I'm reading correctly, Implosion made it clear he was obviously joking around), and then responds with a mocking fake emotion post of Implosion in 97. I was also, like Implosion in post 98, not a fan of Alisae pressing the issue but not actually putting a vote on there when there was already a wagon there. I don't believe town!Alisae normally has a problem voting early wagons, so it seemed out of place for him not to vote Implosion who Alisae was implying was forcing an angle and forcing emotions.

Then when the pressure came off of Implosion (Tammy somewhat defends -- or at least tries to understand -- Implosion doing what he did in 99, nacho votes rb 100, rb self votes 101) suddenly Alisae backs off in post 106 and considers Implosion might not take that approach as scum.

If you don't feel he'd do that as scum, then why did you push EXACTLY THAT (I'm not talking the fake emotion part, but the ""Tammy hasn't dropped my towntell yet"" part, which is what you initially started your Implosion push with).

Anyway -- it gets worse. Boonskiies joines the rb wagon in post 105 and for whatever reason, Alisae jumps on Boon for that in post 116 asking Boon to explain the thought process behind the rb vote (It's pretty fucking clear Boon is having fun wagoning his buddy rb and I'm quite sure rb gets that too, but Alisae wants to turn everything into SUPER SERIOUS).

Then Alisae busts out the ""Boon is faking emotion stuff"" just like he did with Implosion, and mocks boon in 137 with a vote -- again taking what Boon did with his rb vote seriously. It feels so off. It's just accusations and not trying to understand any sort of dynamic between Boon and rb.

Anyway -- in 148 Alisae then responds to nacho by saying rb can ""break up townreads and cause panic and chaos by sarcasticly discreditting everyone's towntells on people"" as scum, but gut townreads rb anyway. rb then asks Alisae to explain the gut read and Alisae in 155 is like ""I can't it's only 6 pages."" My thinking here was ""excuse me Alisae -- you've already been forming other reads in these first 6 pages and I know you're a tonal type player, so explain what about the tone makes you feel like rb is town instead of scum, since you think he can do this as both alignments.""

Anyway, this is where I vote Alisae in 159

Alisae uses some AtE in 172. I'm not sure whether this is intentional or not. Alisae has seen me be pushed off reads through AtE before, and knows I'm normally all over the place as town -- so it didn't sit well with me. Then there's my AtE part of the brain that's going -- god I hope I'm not misreading Alisae. But -- I wanted to press on with my lack of posting, and I'm nowhere near convinced Alisae is town at this point, so I leave my vote.

Back to the Alisae Boon thing, because that's what comes up next in 189. Here Alisae makes it very clear he doesn't understand the Boon/rb dynamic, and accuses Boon of being scum loving to hop on a flashwagon. Funny thing, I've seen A LOT of town hop on early flashwagons too. There's like no consideration Boon could be town hopping on a flashwagon, and no consideration that Boon and rb might have a history together and are mafia friends.

rb makes the multiple Alisae vote in 194 as a joking response to Alisae mock asking to be flashwagoned, and since my scumread of Ali hasn't changed, I obviously jokingly fake hammer the fake L-1 in 198.

nacho voting me: Anyway -- now we get to where nacho votes me in 210. I honestly expected some votes given the intentional way I've played this game, and there's the first one. I can also see this coming from town nacho, given the two games I've ever played with him (Laundry and Nightman), I was very different from how I'm playing here. The problem comes later in his explanation...but we'll get to that.

post 220 rb says Alisae is so cute it hurts, and I a billion percent agree <3 (who's still reading?)

Anway, back to Alisae -- in post 218 Alisae discredits Boon saying that even rb knew Boon was joking. Again, no attempt to understand the dynamic, just assign a scum motivation to Boon. Also some more AtE at me.

THEN Alisae gives me the ultimatum in 234 -- FROG EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR ELSE DUN DUN DUNNNN. So obviously I reply with a vote on Alisae because I'm intentionally doing this to see how Alisae reacts (and oh yeah, I still scumread Alisae. At this point in time, the only thing that could be town that's going through my mind about Alisae is that maybe the emotion is legit and Alisae is just confbiasing on Boon and just finding way too many scum reads, which can definitely happen to town -- but mostly I still think Alisae is scum).

Alisae then does what I kind of expect, and votes me in post 244 and says I'm playing to my scum meta. I 100% expected Alisae -- AS EITHER ALIGNMENT --  to push me for not playing my town game because I'm NOT playing my town meta. Period. I'm being extremely blatant about NOT playing my town meta. Alisae says I never want to be wrong on him (100% true), and that I'm not trying to sort him (it appears 100% true, but that's only because I'm not typing out my thoughts around him. Indeed I'm trying to sort him and that's where some of these doubts keep running through my head -- more on that later), I'm not addressing Nacho's points (100% true, again I'm intentionally not because I'm trying to see if I can break my habits and be more analytical and less emotional with my posting, while also honoring nancy's request at the same time). Alisae is 100% correctly pushing me on a meta read, and has explained it very well and to a T. This facts around this push from Alisae are null.

What I think might NOT be null is the EMOTION behind it. I think Alisae as scum would be less EMOTIONAL about me playing to my scum meta, and more trying to prove a point. Here, Alisae really seems defeated that I'm (supposedly) not trying to sort him. This is evident further in post 333, 343, and 358. I really at this point doubt my Alisae read, and think all the earlier stuff might be Alisae confibiasing or just trying to hard to find scum. Seriously -- town!Alisae would definitely get frustrated that I'm (supposedly) not trying to read him, and scum!Alisae would almost surely just be like, ""frog is scum and here's why"" with less emotion behind it. That's my bet. And you know what... rb even solidifies my feelings around Alisae here with this

SCUM ALISAE WOULD EXPLAIN IT BETTER. I'm almost sure of it. Town Alisae would be really really emotive about this push on me.

Also -- Alisae shows more emotion and pissed off-ness about Boon NOT UNDERSTANDING Alisae's frog read of me in 394 with a vote. Oh hey, emotion 401. Anyway, the rest is Alisae going into a tunnel on Boon chainsawing. Still emotive. Alisae thinking Titus is scum, but then eventually being convinced by Titus to jump back on Implosion (this is stuff that happens to Ali as town).

So at this point...
UNVOTE: Alisae

Nowhere does that say I was hoping to roll town with you and Tammy. NOWHERE. Sure, it says I was excited about the player list. But you know what?! SOME THINGS HAVE HAPPENED that make me intentionally want to post less.

1) EVERY GAME I PLAY TURNS INTO ME POSTING 1000 TIMES
2) nancy specifically asked that I (which I found out was then ""we"") don't spam and shit up the thread. I like nancy. I want to honor her will
3) Alisae didn't look decent to me. Obviously I hadn't explained it because I was intentionally playing that way.

So I'd really like you to explain how you changed my sign up post from what I ACTUALLY posted, to it being something about you and tammy all being town together. Be my guest.

Also this...



GUESS WHAT. I DIDNT CARE THAT WHAT I WAS DOING LOOKED SCUMMY. I KNEW IT WOULD. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WENT FOR.



Explain to me what is scummy about wanting the wagon counts correctly when I'm trying to induce a wagon on myself. I was 100% hoping Alisae would eventually vote me so I could get a more firm read on Alisae, and I have. I think Alisae is town. This gives us TWO wagons to analyze -- the wagon on me, and the one on Alisae  (there's also a third on Implosion, which doesn't directly have to do with my gambit here). I think mine is more scum motivated than Alisae's was, because I'm the easy fucking mislynch here who is intentionally playing like easy mislynch bait. People attacking Alisae are doing so correctly in that they THINK Alisae isn't explaining the read on me very well, but guess what...there isn't a whole lot TO explain when all I'm doing is posting ""VOTE: Alisae"" and correcting vote counts. And I still think Alisae actually DID explain the read on me well. It's a 100% accurate meta read on me that I knew was coming, and it's explained perfectly if you know my town meta.

Problem is, there is a bit of scum meta read that Alisae isn't accounting for, and that it's ""I still post a shit fucking ton"" as scum. Go look up my post counts in HoH (large normal archive) and in Vanilluxe (Ari's game in the micro forum, not archived yet). So Alisae was right about me in that many of the things I did ARE my scum meta -- except this thing I'm doing now by not posting at all is 100% NOT my scum meta.

And this is also where I bring up the fact that Alisae would normally point out I didn't post in White Flag Mafia at all as scum. BUT that was IN A HYDRA with Alisae, and I have a history of not posting in Hydra as ALL alignments. Again -- if you need links for me doing this as town, I'll do so. I also had other reasons to not get into the White Flag game as mentioned at the top of this post.

So now...back to you Nacho -- explain to me why my being concerned about getting the correct votes on the correct people, in the correct order is scummy.

ISN'T THAT EXACLTY WHAT I'M DOING? I'm literally taking actions that have a high chance of making me look like garbage because I DON'T CARE to get scumread. I WANTED to get scumread, and act differently, to see exactly who would wagon me and for what reason, and who would counterwagon who, and for what reason.

That's why I told Tammy ""you'll see"". Because I WANT this wagon analysis for later. ESPECIALLY in a Titus game if Titus is town. I'm going back and forth on Titus in my head, but I think she's more likely town. The main part that concerns me is her pushing Alisae back on Implosion, but that could just be Titus trying to work together with someone she townreads to push a scumread of hers. Most of the other things Titus has done I believe are town.

Anyway -- all this said, I still think you're probably town and Implosion is the scum voting my wagon? The reason why I think you're town is post 640. You say it's a meta-based read, and again, you've correctly read some of the things. But not all the things. You missed my flaked hydra games as town. You've missed the fact that I flaked out in that Alisae game because I DIDNT WANT TO PLAY WITH THINK BIG. I'll go show you the damn Hydra thread. I never even actually got INTO the game. I take the lead in all my Bella hydras, because BELLA IS NEVER THERE. If there's someone just as active as me, then I usually take a back seat. Go look at the games I took a back seat in.

1) With Mollie (town and scum games)
2) With Alisae (scum)
3) With Metal Sonic (town)
4) With Plotinus (third party)

ALL of those names are ACTIVE posters, and sometimes I feel like if they are active enough, they can just carry the workload if they don't mind (and in the case of the Alisae scum hydra where I took a back seat, it was because I didn't want to play with ThinkBig, who again signed up AFTER I did knowing he shouldn't have signed up with me, but the game started before I noticed and had a chance to notify the mod I wouldn't play with TB for the bullshit game throwing he pulled in Cabd's game).

In Laundry I pulled another gambit. I intentionally tried to look scummy in a different way and Tammy jumped on me for it. This time I'm taking an opposite approach thanks to nancy wanting this game to be less toxic and spammy (and so far this game has been fun to read, and there's no toxicity which is awesome).

So I don't expect you to be able to fully comprehend what I'm doing without the full picture of all my hydra games.

I also think you're town because of this

you can actually see a different perspective, and what you're saying here is exactly what I was going for. I didn't want to let people know, because

1) I wanted to honor nancy's request to not spam or be toxic
2) I wanted to see reactions and wagons to my play
3) I wanted to meta break a bit because it's so damn divisive
4) I want to take a bit of a backseat approach and see if that helps my game, because I feel like I'm getting worse over the last several games
5) And most importantly because I wanted to be able to sort Alisae. Sounds dumb? Yeah, but sorting Alisae is always my #1 priority because BFFs.

No, I'm not mad. I am emotive. I'm being emphatic. I'm GLAD you're pushing this. I'm GLAD I think you're town and Alisae is town. But god damn some of the things you've said are pretty damn wrong and even confusing or simply incorrect or made up (like my sign-up post). I'm GLAD we built up two wagons based off my play here. That was my intent.



Anyway -- I think rb is town. I think Boon is town. I think Implosion might be scum? I don't have a read on Tammy. I think Titus might be town? I think Fire is probably town for initially picking up on similar things to what I picked up on Alisae at the same time. I'm not sure about Gin. I think Ari might be scum. And no read on Keyser or Hikari yet (I haven't paid attention to Hikari at all other than Nacho's explanation of his read on me).

Happy to talk about any of this, but to honor nancy's request, I won't be spam posting. Period.

Wait...so you mean you've seen ONE scumgame of mine where I told YOU THE MODERATOR that I didn't want to play with ThinkBig and almost replaced out of it because TB was in the game, and Alisae convinced me to stay in.

Yeah, that's not a representative sample.

No, Nacho is analyzing the game and incorrectly applying correct meta from a small sample size. He even admitted he could be wrong and I'm running some gambit here. That's town thinking.

You're just shooting from the hip on one non-representative game and misrepresenting it as me not posting when I had a perfectly valid explanation -- TO YOU THE MODERATOR -- of why I wasn't posting. I think Firebringer even was backup in that game IIRC. You all should have access to mine and Ali's hydra PT from where I said I didn't want to play with TB after his game throw, and that I would rather have just replaced out.

You're 100% misrepresenting my scum game as not posting, when it's a FACT that you KNEW I didn't want to play because TB was in it.",71697,2017-05-03 18:24:00,687

Implosion's not a strong scumread, but I don't understand his vote on me. It's unexplained, and there's no desire to push it. It's a vote park.

You and Alisae, your votes on me make sense. Wrong, but make sense. And you both tried to push it. And you both had explanations for it that fit with your understanding of my play. Alisae even reconsidered his vote on me and moved it around to others as Ali is wont to do.


Aristophanes' 569 is super weird and it looks like a way for him to both townread and scum read Titus at the same time. That's also his only real explained thought in the game. The rest is ""Titus may be sheepable"" ""Nacho gives me weird vibes"" and what kind of looks like fakeish happy-go-lucky-ness.

I've explained. Twice now. This is the third time. I'm not going to explain anymore after this.

It's scummy because you are misrepresenting my scum play. EVEN if you forgot the ThinkBig stuff, it's still a misrepresentation of my scum play based off a sample-size of ONE. Nacho at least has a bit of a larger sample size to go with, both in my town and scum games, and correctly applied the meta he had seen while also saying he could be wrong about it.

You just said ""not posting is scum frog"" -- which is a misrep of my play, period. It's a way for you to develop a convenient scumread on me based off my early play, since I was the mislynch bait.",71697,2017-05-03 19:06:00,746

This context in particular kills all real concern I had about you not lurking intentionally; I was aware that you were completely capable of posting a bunch as scum (I ended up skimming your ISO in Bees for some reason, probably Tammy's fault), but I thought you flaked on Alisae because you were too busy/drained from playing scum for a while.


Maybe.
The explanation in 106 or 102 or whatever it was (the post that you note is backing off) put the whole push into context for me; the explanation that the approach was weird but unlikely to be coming from as scum is exactly the same as my perspective on it and Alisae's reaction (questioning it, pushing it) was exactly the same as mine, so it's pretty easy to see the town perspective behind it.


Where did Alisae say that Boonskiies was faking emotion; I just thought he disliked the rb vote because he thought it was opportunistic. 
I don't think that not getting jokes is scummy - I didn't understand Boonskies was playing around until he called himself a playful creature.


I find that it being early in the game means that I'm more comfortable with having townreads for little to no reason than I would have been later in the game, and I think that's what Alisae meant - he didn't really have a great way of explaining his rb read right then but it was early game so no big deal.


I can understand this reasoning, and I suppose that's part of what I was trying to get at earlier - Alisae as scum voting you would know that they were making a vote with correct reasoning (aka this is not his town meta, this is what his town meta is) and would be more likely not to abandon it for the Boonskiies push.


It seemed scummy because at the time it seemed less important than addressing things like Alisae's push on you or commenting on the game - correcting votecounts is something you can do via PM and I was concerned that you were using that as a way to dodge from giving content a while longer (which, in retrospect is a really dumb reason to suspect you but it was very very weird at the time).

My initial reaction is just to call this town; I think the read on Alisae looks pretty in depth and genuine and the emotive responses to me also look pretty good. I'm just trying to sort what this looks like if Frog is scum here - I think he probably still would do the whole ""wait to start posting"" gambit maybe probably, but I'm not sure he'd be as able to sell the progression on the Alisae read and the response to me specifically as well.

For context, I believe I raged at RC and that is another motif that I'm always angry at RC nowadays. In that game, I was legit pissed because RC fake guiltied a real guilty claiming I preformed a kill. I didn't so I was angry I was caught for the wrong reasons.


~ Replacing into that game remains one of my best choices on MS. Tried twice to work up the courage to PM Pine to join the replacement queue, only on the third try (wrote three different PMs) did I manage to actually click submit - and just assumed that he would ignore my newb ass. A few days later Transcend taps out at L-1 and I get a PM from Pine. That pretty much kickstarted my (still-nascent) MS career and led to Pine becoming my Senpine. ^_^ ~",71697,2017-05-03 20:00:00,777

Deflecting is when you try to move pressure onto someone else when you're under pressure. It would normally be okay if you are using it to help push a read, and trying to get people who are pushing you to help push the person you're pushing, but you're not even pushing the people you're trying to deflect, you're just trying to get me to leave you alone.

WHen it comes to your Nacho interactions, I'll admit, I'm going off of memory, but I feel like when you do interact with him, it seems kinda like you're trying to appease him. That was sorta what else was bugging me with that one post you were posturing about your meta towards him.

4130,TheRealGin-N-Tonic,"Spoiler: Let's take a look at me 


So starting off in 683, Frog asked me why his vote was scummy. Let us not forget post 679 is me literally picking a fight with him. I was begging for a fight there. Back to 683, I gave a detailed response to Frog in what my concerns were and this post establishes that I'm not just here to whine, but to actually discuss the reasoning behind the statements.




This post is, while sassy, drives home the point that I'm trying to get Frog to understand our miscommunication. The main argument was that Frog thought I used incorrect meta to justify a scum read on him in some shape or form. I first start off by disproving this theory by asking him to look for the part where he voted me. If there is no vote, then that one point of the theory is gone.



This is the next step in dissolving the theory of scum!me to Frog as the part I needed him to understand was that I ALSO didn't use it to form a scum read or shade his slot.



This is then a question that I put in lower-case for viewing pleasure.  This question represents me now digging into Frogs read, I'm not pushing him away, but actively sorting him while asking meaningful questions.

The p-edit shows myself trying to make the message clear what I'm claiming vs what he thinks of me.



Now, I have to admit, why you assume I tried to yell at Frog just to lay him off me is making me scratch my head if you read posts like post 700 because that is in actual words, no hidden meaning, I wanted to argue with you and Frog. I wasn't trying to hide or anything.



This is another question by me that should strike you as ""Gin is trying to sort Frog's slot."" Right here I'm digging at Frog to see if he truly believes what 'I did' would come from scum. I'm trying to find out what Frog's motives are.



This quote pyramid is another example of me trying to get Frog to answer a question that I really wanted an answer too. If I truly wanted Frog to lay off me, why then would I keep trying to bring points back up for us to argue more? That is counterproductive to what you're claiming I tried to do.




Now we're down to the final juice bits of the argument and we get down to where Frog and I have reached the point of talking past each other enough that we've come full circle and we can look at each to say what we think.



At the very end, I finally get to the point with Frog where we fully understand each other. I know his concerns and he thought I made a shoddy excuse to vote Frog. But wait there's more.

I was able to prove to Frog that I not only didnt use the incorrect meta to cast a vote on him, but I was also able to prove through persistent communication that I also didn't use the meta to even cast shade or scum read him. 


In conclusion, I truly tried to solve the issue with Frog instead of just yell him away. Therefore, your theory as to me being scum trying to yell him away is no longer valid. Of course you're welcome to give your interpretation of each post and say how I wasn't actually trying to work with Frog to resolve an issue but it's simply not the case here.",71697,2017-05-04 00:56:00,876

Again, is Alisae actually reading Boonskiies' posts? I'm finding it very difficult placing this overreaction to a town-mindset.


I am buying this as 'a townie being insulted'. rb hurt-posts feel authentic. 
I now love rb.


Looks like town-rb who's been wronged, and thinks he is in the right [righteous indignation].


Boonskiies speaks with clarity and humility, while Alisae speaks with narrow-focused loud venom, unable to take a step back at look at the situation.


Appears like healthy (surface level) town-paranoia.


Further shameful discrediting of all of Boonskiies valid points. Why doesn't town-Alisae reason: why can't town-Boonskiies hold these positions? Theory: Alisae doesn't want to face the sweet music of the truth.


A natural/logical position to hold in regard Fro99er. The added emotional final line illustrates how much town-rb is still hurt.


A initially leaned-town in regard his stuttering and confused intro. I will however re-evaluate his Nacho-read progression later.


Good observation.



Town-Boonskiies taking pride in his own town-game. I'm a believer.

The switch is too easy for my liking.
[I don't believe the sincerity of Alisae's reads]


You need to break down why you are town reading or scum reading players for x, y and z reasons. This 'looking for players who you don't give a shit about' reading looks empty. [Scum motivation: using non-alignment indicative reasons to join a wagon.]",71697,2017-05-04 09:46:00,935

4191,Prism,"Originally I had typed up a long post detailing an informal contract in order to keep myself engaged and accountable but I think it's too dramatic of a step. Instead of laying out a bunch of arbitrary rules for myself to stick to I'm going to lay out my goals for this game openly and ask you to intervene if you see that I am not fulfilling them. The incentive for calling me out if I am not will soon be obvious.

My largest goal for this game is to maintain my own morale and stay engaged with the game straight through. I have formed the bad habit of becoming extremely apathetic and failing to pull my fair share workwise, be it reading or explaining, after a hot start. Specifically, I have a bad habit of making promises I fail to keep, that I will post when I get home, that I will read X person when I have the time, etc., only to think that it can wait for a time when I'm more enthusiastic about the game. I have paid dearly for this repeatedly and have singlehandedly lost my team the game multiple times with my own laziness.

I think one thing I need to learn is that enthusiasm is something created from doing the reading and engaging to begin with, that it's fundamentally a positive cycle. In other words, making the attempt to engage leads to more enthusiasm and engagement, while avoidance leads to more apathy and avoidance. If you at all see me shying away, please call me out and reel me back in.

I realize the optimal entry post is to immediately dive in and give reads, however this is something that's extremely important to me and I strongly feel that laying it out at the very start, publicly, is the best way to dedicate myself to it and give me something to point back to. (Admittedly I'm also just very tired, know I can't read tonight, and know I'm therefore already in danger of falling into the cycle, and think this is a good way to ensure that doesn't happen) Catchup starts during my commute tomorrow.",71697,2017-05-04 09:54:00,937

No, it does not make sense to me. Alisae's scum-cases on both Fro99er and Boonskiies lack any credence, substance or momentum, thus, I cannot see how you are using 'scum-motivation'/'in his best interests' for reasons to defend Alisae. I do not understand how you are town-reading his supposed ""frustation' either. It feels like your finger is not on the pulse of this game (i.e you're defending Alisae for reasons which do not even exist).


rb is the motherfucking truth.


Are you calling Nacho scum, or do you want to talk about his activity? [Feels like an unneccesary interaction].


Sorry, not seeing scum-Fro99er. I feel your main/short-sighted angle is his early low-activity which is null-alignment indicative. ""it's possible that Frogger is town doing a weird gambit"" is enough reason to conclude null on it.

I stand by every read and observation I have made. Every remark is clear and direct. The method and style I have adopted are non-alignment indicative. It was not my choice to enter this game in catch-up mode, but a requirement (the game had reached 24 pages when I recieved my role pm, and could only start posting in the evening). I have taken my time to pick out the most alignment-indicative posts so far. Part of the reading has been painful but I am confident with my reads. Obviously when I have caught up I will be able to interrogate all my null/scum reads and openly converse with other players in real time.

This reeks of OMGUS.
Terrible Fro99er vote. Fro99er is a capable player, him not engaging the way you want him to is not scum alignment indicative.
Overreaction to Boonskiies gentle push.

Discrediting Boonskiies town-meta on Fro99er.
Miss-repping Boonskiies actual actions.
Twisting Boonskiies read to fit his narrative. 
Further lying about Boonskiies ""hard defending"" Fro99er.
Shouting Boonskiies is ""NOT town"" or ""SCUM"" does his argument no favour. Sarcastically calling Boonskiies a ""SCUMHUNTING PRODIGY"" is further discrediting.

I'm not sure what to think about rb's replace out as I was suspecting him and his behavior towards Nacho.  It felt like he was trying to discredit him for his own purposes rather than being frustrated with him as it just didn't read real.  Discrediting a town nacho is a decent tactic as scum though because nacho can be very influential and often works to get the lynches he wants when he wants them.  I can see scum behaving the way that rb did because it was a personal bent that felt more like he was attempting to push nacho off tilt and act like he had a personal issue with him to make him feel bad.  I thought it was scummy, and I thought the rant last night was scummy too.  There's been no attempts to shut down anybody's play style, so all of that just felt unnecessary.

As we talked about later in the game this post is one I remember off the top of my head, Tammy and I have been playing together and Gin expects us to be able to read one another. While I think that it was probably a play from an overexcited Gin to expect us interact immediately as opposed to fairly quickly, I don't think that it's intuitive to assume that Gin and I are scum together - did you read/understand the explanation later and did it affect your opinion on the situation or no?


Why? Those were fairly offhand comments, did you not buy into them because they were too much substance early?


This is my style in a nutshell, as rb noted, I tend to be very reasons-heavy as an individual - why do you think that reaching in order to add words to gut reads early is scummy? Is it just unbelievable in that it's impossible for someone to think something early game AND try to explain it?


Weird post to attack. Alisae thought that Boonskiies voting rb for the ""flashwagon comment"" was opportunistic and a bit too shallow to be believable, and unless you think that ""not picking up on jokes"" is a scumtell (I don't), I don't actually think that you can make a case for this being scummy.",71697,2017-05-04 18:26:00,1010

Early game, I wanted to start a chucklefuck wagon on him to see if I worry him about being lynched early a bit. People didn't end up taking the bait, so no dice there. When he ignored the push on me immediately, I played up the scumread on him to get him respond but still didn't really get anything substantial. This post is me exploring my concern that he was begging for people to pay attention to him without anything substantial to say. Here I prodded him on his attempt to sort me; I didn't think ""why are you so active and town???"" was a valid question, so I made him explain why he was asking it. I was satisfied with his explanation. This is me prodding at him for making a big show of interacting with me and sorting me but still not actually sorting me. This is me urging for him to talk about the reads I generated, to get some more content on the table - I followed up with it when he didn't respond shortly after, but stopped pursuing it because the discussion with Frogger was along the lines of what I was looking for. 

Your case against me here seems to be that because I'm not voting him, I'm not sorting him, but that simply isn't true - Gin in particular I'm willing to give some room (and I'm far more interested in what he does outside of interactions with me anyways so it's not like pressing him is going to help with that) - I also haven't found problems with his positions or his reasoning at all, I've just had a problem with him not scumhunting hard enough yet which is a fairly nebulous concern and not exactly something I can just make him do, especially since we're still in a fairly early stage of the game.


Why do you think Gin would random vote us randomly if we were all partners together? Do you think his motivation there is so he can point to those naked votes down the road and say that we aren't partners together or do you think he simply feels the need to remind us that he's our scumbuddy?


Not everything that you do in a mafia game is intentional. Sometimes, you get frustrated and engaged in a shitshow fight despite the best intentions not to, and sometimes you end up lurking despite not believing that it at all helps your win condition. In this specific situation, I had reason to believe that Frogger had a strong preference for town over scum, and I had strong reason to believe that he was the type of person who got drawn into addressing pushes on him as town (and I explained where I was coming from in this belief). I believed that there was a possibility that Frogger was demoralized on drawing scum because he wanted to solve the game with his friends and as a result was having trouble forcing himself to post - there was a possibility that something else was going on but I strongly believed that if I was right, he wouldn't be able to shake my pressure off him even once he was able to get some posts together and the idea he was caught and he had to dig himself out of a hole would make his job harder - if I was wrong, Frogger as town has been extremely comfortable when responding to pressure and I wasn't worried that I'd mislynch him for that reasoning.

I find it disingenuous that you're pretending that there's just no way that I can have a townread on Alisae even though I strongly disagreed with his case because I saw a lack of scum motivation in his posting when ""it doesn't have scum motivation"" is the same reason you thought that my attack on Frogger was off. I explained before (and I'm not sure what you disagreed with as far as my explanation goes), but I don't think it makes sense for Alisae to go full rambo on Frogger then drop Frogger and go full rambo on Boonskiies in such a short amount of time; as scum, he's risking making a number of enemies and alienating himself from townies for basically no reason - I also think that Frogger's point about emotional attachment to pushes is a good one; from my experience with him, Alisae as town early can get a bit overzealous in pushes and overextend himself in some of his pushes but when I'm seen him as town he's usually a hell of a lot more reasonable about it.


This is not a valid argument - I'm playing a game where I'm supposed to psychic out whether other people's role PMs are green or red - there's always a very large chance I'm wrong at any given moment but that doesn't mean that it's not worth it to pursue my suspicions anyways.

Never called you hostile or even implied it.

I did say that your response made me think you were deflecting because you didn't answer my question.  Which you didn't, you didn't say you had no clue, you said:  ""You did?""  That does not tell me you thought it was a post i made.  It doesn't tell me you didn't understand what I said.  When i say why didn't you have a similar reaction to someone else and you answer ""You did?"" That reads to me like you are asking me if I had a similar reaction and are turning the question back on me.

I'm completely fine if you didn't understand. It makes sense that you didn't understand what I was referring to.  I was in catch up mode and was asking a question based on posts that were quite close to each other in my catch up, so I asked a question based on where I was.  That part of the miscommunication was all me.  But you didn't say you didn't understand, if you don't understand a question I have, just tell me that and I can rephrase or quote what I'm referring to.

But both of the posts reference you being moonlogicy or crazy as town.  Gin even said that you go kinda weird logic and then get ignored.  Aristophanes' comment felt like a joke or maybe a comment about a common thing that people have said many times in many games.  Like in Gay Mafia Desperado literally said that if you make sense you're scum whereas if you're making no sense you're town.

4276,Nachomamma8,"Keyser, I am a sucker for people who suspect me when I'm being townread and your position on me is no exception - there are plenty of games where I'm sort of phoning it in early game and I feel like I might get mislynched and this doesn't really feel like the case here. That's mitigated somewhat by your reasoning. Your position on my early Frogger reads seems a bit unbelievable to me, for example; if I am scum and making a push on a townie who is gambitting, I know that he's not getting mislynched because eventually the gambit will break and my push will be invalidated - thus it doesn't seem incredibly opportunistic to push him unless I really believe he's having a really off game (in which case the narrative where I'm town who thinks he might be scum makes a lot of sense to me). I also don't really understand why you're pushing back as hard against my Alisae townread as you are but not giving Frogger's a sidelong glance; I understand that's probably because Frogger's demonstrated a lot more doubt than I have, but I would think that someone who was scumreading Alisae but later started townreading him would factor into your overall read but it just didn't. 

The big concern I have for your catchup posts is the concern Alisae and Tammy have already expressed; it feels like you decided what reads you'd have before you started catching up. It might be because of format and I might have missed something, but every comment you've made on Me/Gin/Alisae (with the exception of a single Alisae point) has been negative and every comment you've made on everyone else, and that seems unnatural to me. I think that it's natural to doubt yourself and doubt your reads in a game of this nature, and while it's completely possible that you're just a bit confbiased as town I can see a very clear picture where you as scum form three main scumreads because that's how many scum you're looking for and then making a narrative from there.

What parts of implosion's read do not make sense to you?

What about Nacho/Tammy/implosion's interactions don't make sense? Is it based on your experience with them or is it something more?

Same question for Alisae/Aristophanes.

Can you clarify these things further based on your current perspective though? I can't understand the reasons for your perspective if you don't explain them. Even if you feel you've explained them in the past, could you please reiterate them? I want to know if anything has changed.

I was going to ask Keyser if anything in Alisae's play so far struck him as noteworthily town-indicative but tammy already did 
I'm trying to read keyser off of his read of alisae. It might have been what tammy was going for with her line of questioning but it seemed like keyser had a rather massive laundry list of reasons to see alisae's play as scum that were mostly not really considered in both directions, and a lot of which were somewhat stretching (like accusing alisae of misrepping boon for accusing boon of white-knighting, which isn't really a misrep, more just a straight accusation). I haven't read keyser's catchup posts closely, but it was reminiscent of either confbiasing town or scum who doesn't have any incentive to look deeply into things, and so i want to figure out if he is confbiasing. Most of the time when I have early scumreads they still do things that make me question my read sometimes, with a few exceptions.

A lot of the points keyser made have a theme that alisae is generally twisting/misrepresenting/otherwise distorting peoples' play, but i don't think i see scum motivation there, i think i just see alisae being aggressive in a bunch of directions and seeing what falls out.",71697,2017-05-05 01:21:00,1029
4284,Boonskiies,"Catching up.

Starting at Page 32. This may be weird to follow, as I'm going to read and comment while I read.

Spoiler:  Keyser posted that he thought Firebringer was town for Wifom Fueled reasoning? And OTT (over the top?) refusal to solve the game? Why is that a town read to you? Like, that's just saying a a bird can fly just because it's a bird. Hello? PENGUINS!!!!

@Alisae - Nacho didn't state anything on me that was completely profound or anything. You read the exact same posts he town read me for. You let up just because Nacho town read me? Completely throwing out the idea that Nacho and I could have drawn scum together? (would be a pretty awesome team!!!) Yes, you claimed why you left Frog, but that fact alone should have been the reason you saw me differently, not because Nacho stated explained why he town read me. Kind of looks like you were just trying to get on his good side.

So far, I actually like Gin's posts, specifically towards Rb. I saw you all weren't liking him on a later page, so maybe I'll get to that and change. I liked 805 from Gin, and it seemed like he was legitimately frustrated/confused. 

Meh, I don't really like when people go ""Explain the scum read on me!"". I feel like scum if they get caught want it to be for actual reasons rather than just town flailing all over the place and happen to land on scum. I usually engage with the person and see if they trip up on their read on me when I want them to explain it. I kind of am starting to see why people think Gin could be scum. I'm indifferent so far.

Gin posts he thinks that the vote was opportunistic, but I don't really see Rb's vote as that. I can't tell if I scum read or town read Rb's posts in this situation. ugh. I can see it coming from both sides, but I guess that's just Rb. Lol at Gin and the god complex post. He seems actually frustrated, but I don't think that's AI. Town or Scum I think would feel this way if Rb was doing what he's doing to them.

Firebringer went in during that little bit and stated he thought Gin was town. Why? I'm incredibly indifferent with Gin thus far in the game. Explain?
Also, I posted back then asking Firebringer if he thought Alisae and I were Scum vs Scum, which is laughable to me, especially considering he voted Alisae with me. And then he doesn't acknowledge the first part of my post that he quotes, so I have to ask him again. I'm not liking Firebringer so far. Alisae had even voted Implosion for a while too. That proposed scum team of his was just way out left field. It seemed really fabricated to me.

Rb votes Alisae calling it an extreme game changing vote? You were voting Alisae earlier...and why did the Gin read just drop away?

@Titus - Why can you see Alisae/Implosion? I feel like she was rallying pretty hard to get people to vote Implosion. It even got pretty decently sized, I though. I'll have to go back and check, and see how Alisae got off that wagon. 

Man, I really don't like anything Alisae does. Asked Titus about her read on him, when Titus had just said he could see Alisae/Implosion as a scum team. I don't know, guys...I see it as as scum trying to find out what everyone's read on them is so they can try and manipulate the game to their liking. 

DAHELL!?!? now she votes Keyser? 

Although, I will say that Frogger is different than I have seen him before. 

I like Implosion's post about Gin. It seems genuine, and I feel like I might think similar in his position. I don't get the Aristo votes really. I feel like Aristo was just making catch up posts before she went ahead reading the thread. This is a little hard of a game to keep up with. Seems a little opportunistic to me. 

Rb hasn't really given reasons for any of his votes, has he? Implosion is town reading him for his posts?!?!? What?! Implosion, you scum read Aristo yet you were null on Keyser, Froggy, and Titus...?

Oh, Rb replaced out. -.-

HEY HEY HEY. I like dat Keyser post. He sees where I'm coming from.  I'll be weary of you pocketing me; we've played enough together where I feel you might be able to abuse and potentially pocket me. Hmm, I don't know if I agree with how you posted towards Gin. I generally was okay with how his reads list were. He explained it to a sense, and his ""people i don't give a shit about/people i give a shit about"" was just another way of him showing how he was forming his town/scum reads. 

@Prism - Alright, opposite of Rb's playing. We'll see if you can live up to that, yeah?

Mm, I like Keyser's 938 besides the him saying he doesn't see Frogger scum, then putting him near the bottom of what seems to be his null reads. That doesn't necessarily add up to me. Firebringer said that it's a bad list?! I like that list!!! I don't agree with some of the reads, but it doesn't make it a bad list. (I may be biased, though. I'm in the top section. Told you guys I need to remember to be weary about being pocketed.)

On Keyser to Gin, I don't necessarily see anything wrong with tone reading here on Day 1. I generally feel like Day 1's are going to be all over the place anyways.

Man, I really like that Keyser is pointing out all the things about Alisae that I felt. Okay, I'm going to do it....I'm putting Keyser as a town read. Keyser's posts actually make want to lean town on Gin, though, but I like the posts on Alisae! Even though I kind of already posted those things on Alisae.

Haha at Hikari. Keyser's the hare, and Hikari's the turtle. Slow and steady wins the race! Keep up that pace, then laugh in their face! Spray any oncoming attacks with mace, and don't trip over your shoe lace!

Man, Alisae, don't call us classic TvT...ugh. 

Nacho, help me with this, do you still find Alisae obviously town?

I don't see Alisae as scum with Nacho. I think i already stated that I think it's more likely that Alisae is trying to get on good terms with Nacho.

i agree with you Titus; the nacho/implosion/tammy thing is weird, but I'm generally not scum reading any of them, bar a few weird things that Implosion has done. I actually think Tammy is one of the town reads I'm more confident about. 

I'm not going to read those games linked by Alisae...I'm catching up with these posts, and I'm just not about looking through those right now...maybe later.

Oo...I like Titus talking about Alisae in regards to giving Aristo a break but jumping on the SNEEZY PEOPLE!!!

Aww, Hikari's cute. I just want to read him nursery rhymes constantly. He looked through Alisae's games.  So basically Alisae's defense with meta is that she does all those things as any alignment? -.-
@Hikari - Neighbors generally claim Day 1, I feel. Neighbors are always suspicious of each other...too much noise keeping them up at night.

Keyser's 982 seems pretty on point to me.

I like Tammy's thoughts about Rb. I was starting to go south with him too.
I don't understand ""how"" they are scum reading Nacho. If people had been saying more along the lines that Nacho was being too universally town read (actually, someone might have said that, but I forget) it would be a little more acceptable, as I generally get paranoid from people that are town read all over the place, but with the game state so far, I feel it's more likely scum is trying to get on Nacho's good side...*cough* Alisae*cough*

@Tammy - I think Titus is just having a hard time following how you guys interact each other/read each other. You guys know each other well, so things they do might seem more obvious to you than it does to others. I see it kind of like when you are close friends with someone to the point where they can legitimately embarrass you and you think they are super lame and uncool (but you still love them, of course) and then people on the outside say ""yeah, he's pretty cool."" and you go into complete shock. Does that make sense? I probably could have worded it better. 

@Nacho - why do you suspect people when they scum read you when you're being town read. I've been scum before and became the town leader and was being universally scum read. That's a reason I generally get some suspicion to people being town read. That being said, I don't like Keyser's push on you.

I'm really not sure how you see me as posturing right now. I said Titus looked good and so far I agree. I'm just wary when Titus looks good because she does that a lot better as scum. I said Alisae doing the caps thing made me wary because of This Game (And this string of posts in particular) where he used AtE and Caps really well as scum and tricked me into believing him hardcore

Yes, I'm aware of that. Like you, I'm still catching up to the game. Unlike you though, I'm consolidating everything into one large post that will show how I read the game when everything is all said and done. I've done so much skipping around at this point that I can't give an accurate read of a specific section like you and Keyser can. So you let me do my thing and I'll let you do yours.

I fully acknowledge that my catchup post is going to give everyone a null read of me, since I could easily just retroactively sheep the town. But once I'm caught up, I plan to become an active and productive player, so I will be much easier to read.

In the meantime, I want to socialize with people where possible. Playing well isn't my only goal here though.  I'm genuinely hoping that I can make some friends in this game, since this seems like a group of cool people. In addition, I don't want to be perceived as a flake, because it hurts my chances of making friends, so I'm letting people know that I'm putting effort towards this game and I legitimately care. I feel it's especially important after earlier where I almost replaced out. And please, nobody read into this paragraph as indication of my alignment one way or the other.

And just to let you know, I don't usually use emoticons, but that doesn't mean I'm not smiling too. I'm just kinda OCD about maintaining my writing abilities by sticking to strict spelling and grammar. And I don't know how emoticons should interact with words syntactically. Also, I never know when to use them. When I use them, they feel disingenuous. Not that I think other people are when they use them. I'm just so bad at being emotionally expressive.

All of it. I don't really see Implosion and Nacho melding at all. Nacho and Tammy are basically circlejerking for each other. I'd be thrilled if they are town and we get a dual town game, but I'd like it if someone other than them saw it.

Alisae jumps down anything popular but with Ari, it's give him time. Hmmm...

4322,Prism,"Heads up that I'm on my phone so the citations for this post could use some work. These thoughts are also based off of my thoughts from reading ~14 hours ago so they might be slightly inaccurate-I've tried to signal where my memory is less confident. After typing it up and editing it a few times it's also a bit scattered, but I would say my point about Boonskies's reaction to Alisae is the most important part for people. My comments on Nacho are more for him. Unfortunately that's become par for the course and that needs to change.

I'm only up to the mid 20s right now but I'm having a lot of problems with Nacho so far. His read on Boonskies from that time is a major stretch. Boon's early vote on rb was the only thing I found town about him, and his reaction to the Alisae dayvig was really bad in my opinion. It was very transparently focused on saying ""Haha I'm town"" to Alisae for no apparent reason-why say ""Well I'm town so you're dead good job"" and leave it at that? It seems to me as though he'd make more of an attempt to get more of Alisae rather than simply fingerwag that they'll die because he (Boon) was town. Let Alisae's death be the one to say ""I told you so."" It reads as a major failure to a pretty transparent reaction test.

VOTE: Boonskies for now.

I believe there was more to it but townread came off really contrived and so did his read evolution on Gin. I have a lot more to say about reading Nacho and my current thoughts on him but a big subset of those are better saved for 15-20 pages down the line.

I don't know what I liked about Titus but I did. I also liked the look of Frogger push that happened early on. I use ""look"" because it appeared to require meta verification.

Aristo's comment that it was only 4/5 hours also threw me for a massive loop and I think provided much-needed context for why those first ~20ish pages were all over the place. Then again, as I said I'm really poor at reading for alignment with a replace in so maybe that's more me trying to shift blame from myself instead of just taking responsibility for my flaws.",71697,2017-05-05 06:19:00,1068

The most visceral impression I've had from what I've read, and what I want more input on from others, still comes from Boonskies's reaction to Alisae and I think that anyone town reading him should reconsider.

Eh, i don't really read it strongly either way. His reaction makes plenty of sense from town-boon who realized it was probably a reaction test but wasn't sure. If someone made that claim to me i can basically see myself doing something along the lines of saying ""kk"" and just waiting patiently for the next modpost to confirm that they were faking, while just continuing the game as per usual. It looks to me like boon just responds to it because he's sort of obligated to, and is more interested in making other arguments e.g. about chainsawing. 

Why do you think boon would try to get more out of alisae, even if he thought the claim was real? I mean in a sense you could argue that it's ""optimal town play"" because you'd know that they're a townie who's about to die. But if I were town and got wrongly desperado'd d1 i think my reaction would be more ""well, you're a dumbass"" than ""do you have any reads before you die??""

Just came upon this question. The answer is that because the last time I was around before unvoting, the game was 24 pages in, I was told nothing of value had happened yet, and I was so frazzled by the game that I was considering replacing out, so my RVS vote wasn't even on my mind.

The point is more that his reaction to it again felt plainly fake and forced, and hardly as though he believed either would die. Instead of either dismissing it or verbalizing his lack of certainty, he appeared to be focusing on appearing like he believed it so that he'd ""pass"".

I personally didn't like you giving town-points for Gin ""immediately picking up on"" you/Tammy not ""interacting immediately"". Why couldn't scum-Gin do this?

""why do you think that reaching in order to add words to gut reads early is scummy? Is it just unbelievable in that it's impossible for someone to think something early game AND try to explain it?""
Possible. But at the time,  I read the ""this is one of those elusive early Tammy town posts - very highly doubt that she presses for an early read here as scum"" line as adding-the-reason-after-the-read.

Correct. 

""Gin in particular I'm willing to give some room""
I await your consolidated read/thoughts on him. Convince me he is town if that is your position. Right now, all I can see is fake-pressure.

""Why do you think Gin would random vote us randomly if we were all partners together?""
I do not understand his votes, or his read progressions. I look forward to seeing him present his scum reads. At the time, his random/naked votes looked suspicious to me. What was his goal? I took his early 'scum-hunting' play as a facade.

""I had reason to believe that Frogger had a strong preference for town over scum, and I had strong reason to believe that he was the type of person who got drawn into addressing pushes on him as town. I believed that there was a possibility that Frogger was demoralized on drawing scum""

I would only accept this as likely scum-motivation if Fro99er's wagon/""miss-lynch"" had momentum/genuine substance.

""Alisae as town early can get a bit overzealous in pushes and overextend himself in some of his pushes but when I'm seen him as town he's usually a hell of a lot more reasonable about it.""
How confident are you of this town-tell? Is scum-Alisae incapable of imitating such behaviour?

""there's always a very large chance I'm wrong at any given moment but that doesn't mean that it's not worth it to pursue my suspicions anyways.""
From my perspective, the town-argument should have levelled the scales a bit more in your conclusion on Fro99er. (Perhaps I am putting too much weight into my own reads).

My 3 scum reads/scum leans have stayed the same from my catch-up. Until I am convinced they are town, or that scum is elsewhere, my reads will naturally stay the same.

@Nacho: Thanks for the help. I don't mind meta and past games being used. I think there is some value to it, even though it's not foolproof. In case you thought otherwise, that wasn't my issue early on. Rather, the problem was that I couldn't follow the interactions between all of these people I don't know who know each other. It was fast-paced and seemed to revolve around so much prior knowledge that I didn't have. I'm used to playing in Mafia games where most people are relative strangers to each other.

My current reads, based on what I've read so far. tl;dr available for those who don't believe in reading wallposts.

Spoiler: Alisae = Town and Fro99er = Town I had to put these two together because they are so strongly linked.
Alisae: Nacho's argument from 602 and rb's from #04 are completely completely negated for me now that I've seen Ali's meta and know that he'll get angry regardless of alignment.

He seems quick to jump to conclusions. 244, 394, 651, and 889 are examples where he'll turn his vote on somebody in an instant, then proceed to tunnel them until a new target is acquired, at which point the old one is apparently discarded.

I think there's more to him though. His vote fell off Frog about the time that Frog was asking about vote counts and said that he was up to something. After that, he dialed back significantly. His imp vote was allegedly the result of nobody thinking Boon was scum, which is a fair reason to switch votes. Honestly not sure where he stands on imp right now, but he let Gin go as soon as Gin fully engaged him and explained the interaction between him and Frog. Nonetheless, he's definitely getting tunnel vision on a regular basis. This leads me to believe that while he isn't entirely irrational, he lets his emotions carry him away far too frequently.

Frog makes a somewhat compelling case for town Ali in his 673 wall too. His ""expert"" analysis on the subject shouldn't be discounted lightly. I don't think the issue is that he just really wants Ali to be town, because his actions so far show he's willing to take Ali on if he needs to. Frog seems like the more level-headed of the two, so Ali would probably have a hard time tricking him.

Fro99er: His response to Nacho's scumread in 673 felt really off to me. Like, dude, I get that you're saying your intent wasn't scum-motivated, but when you literally never stated your reasons up until that point, how the hell could Nacho have possibly known them? It's not even scummy, it's just an ill-conceived statement. This is important, because it means that while Frog is allegedly playing analytically, he may not always fully think things through completely. 

678 is interesting, because he actually has legitimate reason to think Gin would know his intent, even though Gin claims to have forgotten. As Gin points out later though, Frog doesn't even consider that Gin may have forgotten. If scum-motivated, I could see it. If town-motivated, it supports my theory of not thinking things through fully. 

The whole interaction from Page 28 onward seemed like town vs. scum until it deescalated. I now think it's just two townies misunderstanding each other.

1. Alisae is scum and townFro99er is being hoodwinked.
2. Alisae is town and scumFro99er knows it, but is clearing him to gain towncred and manipulate Ali.
3. Both are town and just misunderstood each other at first, but are (more or less) on the same page now.
4. Both are scum and have planned this spat and makeup in order to get towncred.

Scenario 1 seems unlikely, because it requires really calculating play (not insulting Ali, that just that it feels like he plays based on his emotions).

Scenario 2 seems plausible, thought unlikely. Ali is self-admittedly emotional and prone to buddying. Frog has every chance to exploit that. But I feel he would've made an obvious mistake by now if that was the case, due to a lack of planning.

Scenario 3 seems likely, since nancy's request to not spam apparently changed Frog's playstyle from usual, leading to Ali feeling ignored.

Scenario 4 seems the least likely to me, but I don't want to discount it out-of-hand, lest I look foolish when it turns out that's exactly what happened. If they are both scum though, I feel like this would have to be pre-planned, rather than organic. Yet some of the stuff along the way feels very organic. Mostly Ali jumping on Boon for ""chainsawing"" and the exchange with Gin. And, as I've said, I don't think Frog's an expert gambiteer (yes, I just made that a word).
tl;dr: Alisae is probably town because Frog's argument was pretty good and there seems to be some thought behind who he's accusing.
Fro99er is probably town because I don't think he's an evil genius. 


Spoiler: Aristophanes = Null 569 strikes me as a way to have the best of both worlds. He can buddy Titus, while maintaining the option to flip on her for competent play late game. On top of that, I don't even agree with the statement that Titus was on the ball. Maybe it's because I missed or didn't understand much of the early game, but nothing I've seen from Titus this game stands out as extraordinary or notable (no offense, Titus).

Other than that, his catch up posts haven't done a lot for me. They aren't scummy, but I don't really feel they are townie either. I think I need to see him catch up fully before I can get a proper read on him. Seems like his scumreads are pretty shaky (though I can get behind rb as scum).
tl;dr: Aristophales is null until he gives more content, but there's a hint of scuminess due to opportunistic buddying.


Spoiler: Boonskiies = Town His early interactions with Ali are pretty good. At the time, I was reading Ali as scum too. He's held onto it for a long time past the point where I think it's reasonable to think Alisae's scum though, so that's slightly troubling.

I like his push in 849. Seems like he's trying to get things done. Don't agree with most of the reads he seems to have, based on 1030. Want to push him more on them once he's caught up.

I honestly don't get the hype. Feel like everybody townreads him so hard and I'm not sure why.
tl;dr: Boonskiies is probably town, but I don't get the hype.


Spoiler: Firebringer = Scum Honestly, he doesn't add anything to the game early on. At least, as near as I can tell. His 854 doesn't feel genuine to me. Boon had to ask him 3 times before he got a response. And if he really did miss it, that implies to me a lack of attention being paid. Considering his lack of activity, it could be indicative of scum coasting. 977 is more of the same. That said, it's not a strong scum read. Coasting can occur in town, but I'd say it's generally anti-town, which is different from being scummy.
tl;dr: Firebringer is slightly scummy because I think he tried to dodge Boon's questions and he just seems to want to coast.


Spoiler: implosion = Town I honestly believe imp's 635. I've been in his shoes before, making that kind of statement out of self-knowledge. When you make a bad play as scum, I feel like you'd typically either want to deescalate the situation by making up excuses that at least sound legitimate or by distracting from it in some way. Instead, he chose to make an argument that, by all rights, shouldn't convince anyone. It's plausible enough to be true, but so unverifiable that it would be almost useless for scum to make.

On top of that, his 78 reads town as fuck to me. I don't see a spy, even a clever one, faking a false memory, only to then pretend to realize that the thing he remembered never happened. Granted, he could have legitimately just have had a false memory as a spy, but I feel lie it would be harder to trigger that. And taken with 635 and the Neighbor claim, I feel really good about him as town.
tl;dr: implosion is probably town because some of his moves likely wouldn't reasonably come from scum.


Spoiler: Keyser SÃ¶ze = Town I can see where Nacho is coming from in 1022, and others have echoed that sentiment, I am inclined to disagree. While I don't agree with any of his conclusions, save for townBoon, I will say that his catchup seems like a genuine and at least seems to have a clear flow. Though I disagree with the conclusions, I feel like I can understand his thought process. Keyser basically seemed have tunnel vision on his current scumreads from the start. And there's blatant confirmation bias going on in the last paragraph of 945, particularly the last sentence. That feels genuine to me. Legitimate confirmation bias is pretty much only possible from town, since scum know when they are wrong and don't have any investment in their reads. And confirmation bias really isn't a good look on somebody, so I can't see scum wanting to blatantly fake it.
tl;dr: Keyser SÃ¶ze's confirmation bias seems like it's coming from the perspective of somebody who doesn't know who scum is.


Spoiler: Nachomamma8 = Town I like his mediation for Ali/Boon and Titus/imp. It'd be in his interest as scum to let them continue to squabble or jump on one of the two, rather than trying to make both sides see each other more clearly. It's interesting what Frog said about Nacho misrepresenting his sign-up post, but that seems so easy to contradict, so I feel that's an honest mistake, not a scum move. On a side note, now I'm terrified of a metagame where scum purposely misrepresent easily-verified past events in an effort to look town. Thanks, Nacho!

His interaction with Keyser right now is pretty good. He's pushing Keyser on all the right stuff and seems to be trying to overcome Keyser's confirmation bias.

While I deeply appreciate him being helpful to me, if he were scum, it would technically be within his best interest to keep me around. I'm the fish-out-of-water in this game and my early disorientation gives him an easy target to take advantage of. Granted, that's the most dickish move possible and I don't think Nacho is a dick. Still, I might get paranoid about that in the future, because I am occasionally inclined towards paranoia against people who I trust in these sorts of games. I almost always end up thinking I'm getting hoodwinked by cunning scum. So if I turn on Nacho (or any of my solid townreads) late in the game, everyone should probably disregard my accusations, unless they are grounded in solid evidence.

The first time we played together, if I recall correctly, he was a spy and tried to buddy me. Granted, that was 6 years ago, his playstyle may have changed, and I believe didn't fall for it that time, so I don't see why he'd think I'd fall for it this time (unless he forgot). Granted, that's exactly what he could hope I'm thinking. But I'm gonna WIFOM myself if I go down that rabbit hole, so let's just say it's unlikely for now.
tl;dr: Nachomamma8 seems like town because he mediates problems, sorts, and works with people who scumread him.


Spoiler: rb/prism = Scum rb early game helped try to get things on track, it seemed. I personally appreciated that, but I kind of feel like his reasons might have had more to do with personal issues with the game itself.

Once the game started moving, he didn't really bring anything of value though, despite being a pretty active poster. His conflict with Gin didn't seem to come from a place of trying to understand Gin or be understood by him or anyone else. It felt like he was honestly just trying to get him riled up. And 845 is just such am anti-town mindset. It feels like he's basically saying ""I'm fine with mislynching if I think a player is bad."" And yet, three posts later in 848, he says that Fire's deliberate glibness is a reason nobody scumreads him. The inconsistency doesn't feel right.

Prism's vote on Boon seems scummy to me too. Without even catching up to the game, they're ready to lay down a vote. I don't think there is anything wrong with a little taunting about a pretty naked gambit.

Prism knowing they may not have internet access for the next couple days and still purposely leaving their vote on Boon, rather than just unvoting seems sketchy to me.
tl;dr: Prism appears to be scum because rb was active without providing much real content and Prism parked his vote on Boon without catching up, knowing he'd have limited access.


Spoiler: Tammy = Null She's such a non-entity during the early periods that I read that it's frustrating. I'm getting a good feeling about her now that she's posting more regularly and actually seems to be trying to solve the game. Need more out of her to be sure though.
tl;dr: Tammy is starting to seem Town, but I need more useful content from her before I can make a full judgment.


Spoiler: TheRealGin-N-Tonic = Town My favorite post from him is easily 876, which is a perfect condensation of his interaction with Frog and Ali. I already townread Gin before the exchange and felt frog and/or Ali had a good chance of being scum at the beginning of the exchange. But rather than taking advantage and making them look worse, Gin tried to work with them so that they could understand each other. He not only solidified my read on him, but made two other people look good in the process, when he could've just engaged it petty squabbling where he would've probably come out looking better. I know he enjoys getting fired up, but I actually think that calmGin is best Gin. He's on-point and pro-town as fuck. I'd say he's easily my strongest townread right now.
tl;dr: TheRealGin-N-Tonic is my strongest townread. He made himself look town while also working with others to make them look town.


Spoiler: Titus = Scum The implosion tunnel is pretty suspect to me. Her reasoning seems to be based solely on 528. Problem is imp explained that sticking point in 573 and it's been referenced multiple times throughout this game (or maybe I've just read it a million times while researching for this post), with her being asked about it directly, and she still ignores it completely.

Other than that, her activity is actually pretty negligible and she's dodged many other questions throughout the game, which you can see if you ISO her.
tl;dr: Titus is my strongest scum read. She's had negligible activity, seems to dodge questions, and is still tunneling implosion, despite her primary claim against him being long disproved.

Second, I mean those agreements Implosion talks about. I don't see two players in sync at all. I see Nacho retreating the moment after Implosion stops pushing Tammy.

implosion-Nachomamma8 early interactions:
Spoiler:  implosion enquires about Nacho's town-read of Tammy [Entitled to ask this question]
Nacho votes implosion. He didn't like implosions vote on Tammy.
implosion says he's townreading Nacho.
Nacho explains his town read of Tammy. [I was unsatisfied with the reason].
Nacho discusses Tammy's scum-meta, saying that implosion's town-tell on Tammy is not accurate, which backs up Nacho's earlier point of Tammy's RVS posts not being ""alignment indicative"".
implosion has only played with town-Tammy.
Instead of asking why implosion town reads him, Nacho says he's 'actually town this time'.
Nacho town-reads implosion's ""odd position"" to take on Tammy.
Nacho calls implosion's vote on Alisae ""not a terrible vote"" but wants implosion to join him on rb [I wouldn't usually see this as a scum-scum interaction, casually talking about which wagon to push together].
implosion town gut reads rb.
implosion shares his town reads: ""tammy-nacho-rb-fire."" [So they town read eachother, but hold different scum reads].
Nacho believes ""implosion's opening approach to Tammy seemed genuine"". [Nacho puts up a firm defence of implosion against rb].
Both implosion and Nacho share how much they love the current game/player dynamic.
implosion is very happy with his town reads (which include Nacho).
Nacho calls implosion ""very town"".
implosion is convinced of town-nacho.
Nacho shares that same sentiment about implosion.
implosion explains his town read of Nacho more. [This is getting excessive now].

Bottom line conclusions regarding implosion-Nachomamma8:

- I actually town-leaned implosion's shakey/stuttering start over Tammy. I feel like scum-implosion would have come out with a stance with more substance (if he wanted to rock the boat and steer us more meaningfully). 
- taking my scum-read of Nacho outside of their interactions, I DO NOT see implosion-Nacho as scum-scum. The moist-yet-hard town-reading of eachother, cosy fondling of eachother's ego's, and public display of their love for eachother was like a scene from one of nancy's most intimate fantasies:

- Thus, I would conclude more likely town/town or town/scum. I really doubt the reverse-WIFOM angle of scum-scum.
- In my scum narrative, this is Nacho pocketing implosion. [Nacho goes out of his way to defend implosion]

4365,Tammy,"

Why do you have to be done sorting for her to put a vote on you?  I'd say we're all still in the process of sorting, so should nobody be voting?  Why can't he just scum read you?

I feel like in the second paragraph you're doing that thing you do where you ignore people's explanations and push a narrative of something that didn't happen and is not happening without assessing what is actually going on.

You do not have to agree on every single thing to be ""in sync"", and you keep pushing that bit which is not a big part of the read anyway.  Nacho was joking with his vote on implosion in the first place; this is exactly what he did in Gay Mafia when Hiplop was voting me.  He wasn't scum reading hiplop at the time, he was making a point about hiplop's bad scum read on me.  Same thing here with implosion.

If you are town, you are misreading/misunderstanding and are ignoring the posts people have made setting that straight.  If implosion is scum, it's not because of that because his early game interaction with me is very similar to the last game we played together.  Here is his iso from that game.  You can see him interacting with me in a very similar way as town in his first few posts:  viewtopic.php?t=62686&f=53&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&user_select%5B%5D=14368&user_select%5B%5D=0&user_select%5B%5D=0&user_sort=Go 

If he's scum, he's just trying to mimic that interaction.  (I'm leaning town at the moment; I'm just trying to point out that the interaction is null as far as I'm concerned.)

I am worried that you saw the beginning of a town group forming and are trying to break that up, which is something that I normally think is stupid, but it's something I am concerned about here.

I don't understand your problem with town read on me from nacho.  And I don't understand why you're acting like it's something you can't touch or prod.  You can still ask him questions.  You can still ask me questions.  It feels wrong that if it's something you don't trust or can't understand that you're not poking at it or trying to understand.

Why?

Alisae overreacts as town (and as scum).

I'm looking at Alisae's emotional drive and it seems like he's actually hurt that I might be scum and that it appears from his perspective that Boon was defending me/attacking him.

4374,Fro99er,"Spoiler: Frogger's catch up wall

special @'s to Alisae, Keyser, Tammy, and Titus 
@Keyser -- This is BS.

Alisae's push on me was valid given how well he knows my town game and how I wasn't playing toward my town game. The push on me from a factual standpoint is null. Again, I'm reading Alisae's emotions around the push as town.

Yes, the case on Boonskiies is worse, definitely. It's just Alisae attacking Boon for Boon's stance on Alisae's push on me.


@Alisae -- Are you implying scum have daytalk?


I don't see that as what Keyser is trying to do at all. I too have some paranoia about you and nacho. I think I townread you both, but I can also see why I'd be very wrong, because you both found the easy push on me when I intentionally played that way.


@Titus -- what specifically doesn't make sense about the Nacho/Implosion/Tammy interaction? I think the implosion thing you pointed out got shown incorrect, no?

I saw your Ali/Ari one and I agree


Ali is jumping down Keyser's throat, but not Ari's


@Tammy -- Hi Tammy. I like your observation in 984. Then your 985 where you talk about rb, I agree, but for different reasons. I was actually townreading rb up until his replace out, but I kinda read his replace out as frustration that he couldn't pad his ISO with shitposting, which is something I can see him doing as scum. Granted, it could also be town just frustrated they can't play how they want, but it did make me take notice.]



I wasn't even really trying to do slayer's gambit so much as not play to my really obvious town meta while also doing nancy's wish at the same time, and get some vote counts for it for later. I'm was never saying we'll nab scum D1 form it or anything. But it did help me get a better read on a few people (although now I'm starting to doubt my Alisae read again).




I'm back -- talk to me! I definitely am only leaning slightly town on Titus. If Alisae is town, I can see scum!titus pushing Alisae back on to a town!implosion, for example.

Why is this scummy? What does scum!me get by doing this? And why is the overreaction unneccesary? If anything this is NAI for me.

 I was expecting him to tell me if it was RVS or if it was real thing he wanted to push and if it was a real thing he wanted to push why did he want to push it. I feel like this is misrepresentation.

This fails to consider the narrative that I was extremely frustrated with Frogs posting, and thus may have not been actually paying attention or thinking about what Boon was saying.

--

So his meta is more reliable then mine is what you're saying? Yeah, this is scummy because it discredits my own experience with Frog which is a lot.

Again, I wasn't actually paying attention to what Boon was saying because I was emotionally frustrated with what was going on. This is scummy.

You're taking this completely out of the context that I was emotionally frustrated with the play that was going on and using it to fit your scum narrative of me that you're trying to build up.

This is NAI if you consider the narrative that I was just frustrated.

1022 - Nacho, this is because EVERYTHING about Keyser's posts just seem unnatural. His tone even screams unnatural to me!
1027 - @Ari My concern wasn't about them looking fake... Why did you feel the need to note this concern publicly?
1029 - @Implosion If you were to suddenly flip scum, why does it seem like you're setting me up to be your buddy? I got this feel awhile back, but now with this it's just starting to increase.

1030 - @Boon I mostly started townreading you because of posts Nacho reminded me about when I was talking to him about you. Things I missed and didn't even bother to read because I was flustered with what was going on at the moment. Basicly I just approached my read on you with a clean slate and reset completely.

I usually say something along the lines of ""explain your read on me"" a lot to try to understand what the person's concerns are, and then try to address their concerns.

Besides that, I felt the rest of your wall was kinda like a thought dumb and was sorta not concise so I just skipped the rest of it 

1042 - @Ari My read on Titus was mostly because I didn't like her early approach to Tammy and Nacho and Implosion early. Also, why do I get the feeling Titus and Implosion are scum together and I'm being setup by both of them as Implosions buddy. That kind of worries me here.

1062 - @Gin I disagree. Well, I must be scumclaiming now. But I feel like Ari isn't actually doing anything with those catchups. He scumhunted a bit but I don't see him producing actual content with those wallposts.
1068 - @Prism Staaaaaaaaaaaawp me and Boon was a TvT  Why do you place a vote while you're catching up? Also, can you give me other reads when you get a chance?
1072 - @Prism what did you like about said post?
1086 - @Hikari I hope you don't mind me getting back to you on this. I want implosion to address some of my own concerns first.


@Frog - Why do you seem very bored and disinterested in some of your posts 
please don't be scums 

1127 - @Boon It depends on the player and the views of the player. For example, this is something we did to Tammy in Gay Mafia, because when Tammy is town she can get the town to be cohesive and work together. We viewed Tammy as the biggest threat and thus tried to take her out. The scumteam for example could view Nacho as the biggest threat. It depends really.

That's an interesting conclusion to draw from that post.

I could sort of see that but that isn't generally how I operate as scum (I'm happy to get deep into my self meta if anyone wants but it's not especially meaningful here). It might look that way in general because you're one of the reads that has changed more as the game's progressed.

Sure



The ""sorting"" and ""pot kettle"" stuff are just natural sounding, and like you know you're scumreading titus for something you kinda have done yourself, but now you actually mean it and you are (ironically) sorting titus here. You've pointed out Titus question dodging, which is a correct-ish observation, but something I've seen her do as Town as well.

The more tonwy part is the second part where you're challenging Titus' position. You're picking up on the fact that, from what you see, Titus is kind of shading nacho while not actually pushing nacho, and the thing Titus is shading nacho for is sketchy at best because it assumes nacho isn't able to read tammy. Could scum!you say this? I guess, if you're trying to shade Titus. But it sounds like you're questioning Titus' motive rather than just blanket scum reading Titus. Things make sense, and the tone you used sounded like you didn't care that you were pushing on Titus here.

4640,Tammy,"So I skimmed through most of this during the break at the ice show and didn't find a whole lot useful; I'll be around for a little bit but I'm probably crashing soon so not that long.  Mostly what I see is personality clashing all over the place and it doesn't help me read anyone.  It doesn't help that I'm leaning town on both fire bringer and boon skies and am more concerned about reads elsewhere though so it's mostly registering as background noise.

I would very much like for the argument to stop now though because it just feels like fuel is being added to the fire.  I could be a complete dope but boon is just looking more town from all of this.  I did get a bit weirded out by boon's wall last night because my memory of him was not to put much effort in (my experience is limited to a portion of a game I played with him as an alt and my teammate being in his game in team mafia), so I did a little bit of research last night and found his most recent completed scum game and looked through some games where he was town and I think he's probably town here.

You can't read Aristophanes as him just posting means he's town anymore.  i did some research into that too last night and found that he posted as scum, so that's no longer a gimme.  However, I didn't actually read the posts to see what he posted, it's just not that easy anymore.  HOWEVER, the post I quoted where I asked if scum aristophanes would be cheeky as scum and asked nacho about it, looks town from him as does some of his self-meta here tonight.  I would have liked for him to scum read nacho for a little bit longer though because I have a hard time seeing scum!aristophanes pushing nacho as his fake scum read, so that would have made me feel better about him.

I do feel pretty decent about hikari link and every time someone on my periphery of possible scum starts looking somewhat town, my concern about Titus grows and grows.  What Nacho said about Frogger should have been applied to Titus.  I was expecting her to interact with me a little more if she were town at the start of the game.  I was here and posting and having a good time, I thought she'd join in or something.

See it's things like this that need to stop in this argument.

Fire bringer calling Boon RC isn't saying he knows your town, it's attacking your attitude and saying that you're behaving like him.

And Aristophanes, you don't need to add fuel to this fire and make boon keep on arguing with you about things.  Just stop with boon.  We all know how you and fire bringer feel about boon right now and we know how boon feels about you guys.  You guys are going to drown out this game with this unhelpful argument.

Yeah I kinda get that feel; I don't much like the static scum reads.  Nacho was right though that his progression on rb felt the best.  I haven't had a moment to sit down and look at his scum reads on gin and alisae though and reference back.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to do that tomorrow.  (I need to do that with Prism's case on boon skies too.  Kind of a reminder for myself.)

I remembered what I wanted to comment on.  Alisae mentioned thinking that scum suggested to discredit nacho ahead of time, and you doubted that they'd do something like that.  I can see where Alisae might be thinking along those lines though.  He just got finished playing Gay Mafia in which he was in a scum hydra with Titus, and they tried to kill me night one (after a day one less than 24 hours quicklynch) and the kill didn't go through.  The scum plan was to start discrediting me immediately, and try to get me mislynched, before I could start getting any cohesion together in the town.  So, I can see Alisae looking at some behavior and wondering if a similar thing is happening here.

I'm leaning town on all of those too.  I've played with prism for a very brief time when he hydra'd with nacho a few months ago.  I replaced out early day one though.  I do know he has a very good scum game, and I'm a little surprised that in his discussion about nacho and his read on nacho he didn't address my read there at all.  I know that sounds really self-absorbed and it's only a little bit.  When they hydra'd together, Nacho was hoping to get better at fooling me and discussed how hard it has been for him to fool me as scum.  (And I started scum reading him during our first interaction that game.)  So I kinda thought he'd address it a little bit, but I could be expecting too much there.

Those are all the reads I want to sort as well, though I'm leaning town on Aristophanes and Implosion but I don't feel great about those leans.",71697,2017-05-06 02:28:00,1411

I still want to point things like that out, but I'm holding off!

Once I reread them I'll cone to you with a better idea if I believe it's TvT or TvS. It's possible either way and I'd hate to do all this, have it be a TvT, then get more townies lynched in the followup from it!

4677,Tammy,"Okay I don't normally do pre-flip associations and sometimes find even after the fact associations silly and short-sighted and part of this might be from me following a player from another site do this quite often and it work well from him and part of this is probably just rambling,

but I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of Titus and Implosion being partnered together.  (Oh yeah, another thing I wanted to look back at is why Alisae thinks he's getting set up as an implosion buddy).  But let's say Titus and Implosion are scum together, why would she start that whole thing about the interaction between me, Nacho and Implosion being off to her?  I can a lot of motivation for a scum Titus to try to weave doubt into it if we're all town, but if Implosion is scum and titus is scum I'm drawing a blank.  If somehow her scum buddy had weaved himself into a strong town circle from the get go, why start poking at it, why not use it to manipulate us?

Sure there's distancing, but that distancing just feels a bit unnecessary there on page three.  I know that titus likes to be mamahen as scum, which I'm guessing that means she likes to control the scum team, but even then I don't see the big gain.

Unless Im missing something, she's not pushing very hard there even though she keeps referencing him as her scum read, she seems more intent on telling nacho and me that we feel off.  So that makes it a bit inconclusive.

I do think Titus has a good chance of being scum.  I have a town lean on Implosion, but it's not great.  And to me it feels like there's two kind of spheres here and it's one that I wish I could settle.  I don't think that Titus' reasons for scum reading Implosion are great, but that doesn't mean he couldn't be scum outside of those reasons.  But right now, I don't see them as a pair (please don't take this as gospel if one flips), so I feel like if I can solve one the game would start to fall into place for me.",71697,2017-05-06 03:00:00,1423

I defended RB with regards to the replace out because it should be NAI. I know that wasn't a major point in the long run, but it was still a point made on the slot which required addressing. Even if a slot is scumread by me, I still try to stick with AI posts and occurrences to push them so I quite disliked your mention of the replacement spurring your scumread.

I'm not sure if scum-aristophanes is capable of talking in that brazen of a way about his meta in a game like this in a way that sounds that genuine. The last line of 1414 sounds much more like at-ease town aristophanes than what I think i'd expect from him as scum. I think I'd expect a more curt answer from scum-aris. Him saying ""I can't think of a single other that breaks this meta"" is something that I find somewhat unlikely from him as scum who is breaking that meta in this game.

This is completely true. It's a very, very nebulous concept and I'm probably not consistent in the way that I use it. There are cases (the easiest example being outrage) where genuineness is not really indicative of alignment necessarily; like, if you see a player being angry, they are most likely either genuinely angry town, genuinely angry scum, or fake angry scum, so simply seeing it as genuine doesn't mean much. But sometimes genuineness is really synonymous with ""things i don't think scum would be able to fake.""

I hate it when you make these kinds of statements because he is literally responding to you saying this:



It doesn't in any world imply he knows you're town.  The treating someone like they're town tell is wrong 99% of the time.



Your perception is wrong.  You know that mafia is played by real people with real motivations and this looks like you're trying to act like they're robots.

We can take a step back to an earlier conversation we had in which you claimed that your ""you did"" to me was you telling me you didn't know what i was talking about.  The textual reality of that conversation says hell no you did not because in not one place did you say you didn't know what I was talking about.  The textual reality of that conversation reads like a deflection because it's literally what it is, but you claim you meant something different.  So do I take the textual reality or do I take your  explanation even if it doesn't fit with the textual reality?  Quandary.



So why haven't you been poking at this?  Why haven't you inquired as to my read on nacho beyond the initial?  Do you think I'm too inept to tell when Nacho is trying to manipulate me so blatantly?  Will he one day, yes I believe he will, but today is not that day.  Besides this runs counter to how he does deal with me as scum.  If you read any scum thread in which he talks about the people in the game, he always says I'm going to be his biggest obstacle.  He says he'll probably have to read me as town, but considering the fact that it's his dream to mislynch me, he always points out that he'll take that opportunity if it presents itself.  The last time he read me too easily as town it set off alarm bells.

He's far more apt to decide to treat me as town at the beginning of the game as town and reassess from there than he is to treat me as too town as scum.  Gay Mafia says this is exactly how he would treat me and interact with me at the start of the game when he's town.

I told you I read nacho based on our interactions and that is town.  What is your read on nacho based on the other things he's doing?  He's done a hell of a lot more this game than what transpired in those first three pages.



This is why communication between us always breaks down.  You tell me I'm doing and saying things I've never done.  You said I accused you of being hostile earlier when I said or implied nothing of the sort.  You're saying I said something when I actually said the opposite.

I would like to know how you read the following and got that I am telling you to plug your nose to the circle jerk.  I'm literally saying my problem with you is that you are NOT prodding at it if you're having trouble with it.

There are two things I have to say about this post (and because I skimmed while out I saw the conversation after).

This is why rb's treatment of nacho wigged me so much.  Now I don't know what rb's experience with Titus is, but fire bringer seemed like he was suggesting that they always argue.  And Titus, you know I love you so this is not an insult, but I know very few people at this site more arrogant than Titus.  So him talking about nacho like nobody could deal with him because he was so arrogant and rude and insulting but playing lovey-dovey with Titus feels all kinds of wrong.

Oh there are three.  This is an insult by the way.  And this is the type of thing that feels so damn posturey from you.  And considering that people often dismiss things you say because moonlogic, you should know what this is.

This type of thing does absolutely nothing to further the game state or develop reads.  People do not agree on the same things for what makes people look like town or scum, and you know this.  Why couldn't you just say why the post was bad from your point of view.  It doesn't look like a misrep to me.  You haven't been driving the game, and asking questions doesn't make you an entity.  You might be sorting behind the scenes, but that doesn't come across through the thread.

My main problems with you are lack of engagement with the game.  You don't seem like you're trying to solve it.  Sure you do ask questions here and there or pop in to make some remarks, but the majority of your reads still seem focused on the first three pages of the game.  (Maybe you do work off thread, I do too so I get it that not every thought is going to be posted in the thread, but there's no evidence of that.)  How would Hiraki know that you scum hunt based on group dynamics?  How would he know you're sorting?  That is not evident.",71697,2017-05-06 17:37:00,1558

I agree with Froggy that Hikari's posts came off as town, but Fire yelled and made a sarcastic remark at Hikari early on our 1v1, so I might have been skewed. Titus generally scum reads me and eventually pushes for my lynch, and she said she kind of town read me this game, but then she posted a radical out there kind of thing, which shows she has some sort of paranoia about me.

Why couldn't he be doubting himself on the read?  Do you expect him to be able to read you 100% and pretty early in the game.

Also sometimes people might not be enjoying themselves for reasons that aren't dependent upon their alignment.  I hate playing scum, but I too have to fake it, but sometimes as town I'm not having fun because I'm not for a variety of reasons, and sometimes it's as simple as a person I really wanted to play with I'm scum reading and that blows, which is pretty lame but it happens.

(For instance, Nacho and I read each other very well, have been playing together for years and hydra, and we don't always have a solid read on each other very quick.)

alisae is complicated. I think a lot of the reactions he's had to things are more complicated than i think would be easy to fake as scum. His opinions have evolved over the course of the game in a way that looks to me like there is an actual thought process that is creating them. The evolution of his read on me, the way he gave his ""reads"" as he replaced out not having everyone on it, the way he talked about Ari, lots of little things that he's done since the early game have pinged me as town. He doesn't look overly concerned with perceptions of himself, he seems mostly concerned with enjoyment in the game or with getting something on the board in terms of having things to analyze/interact with.

Spoiler:  Okay let's try this again.  This is now, for the third time, another example why communication between us breaks down.  You do not read my posts, or if you are reading them you're skimming them or something because you are again saying I said something I did not say.  I feel like I'm being patient and trying to sort you so that we can work together if youre town, except for that last response I'm sorry for, but I'd really really appreciate it if you'd read my posts.

I did not say you had to argue.

I'm going from this:



And



(Which came after a post where he suggested a you/nacho scum team.

Both of those gave me the impression that your interaction day one was not all happy-go-lucky.

I never said you had to argue.  I wondered what the fact that he was being nice to you meant for his alignment.



I never said you called him arrogant.  Rb called him arrogant.  Rb went on a whole early rant about how nacho is arrogant and rude and insulted his intelligence once in a game (which I looked, he didn't, at least not to the extent he said he did) and was using that as a reason to discredit nacho and not listen to anything he said.  My concern where you come into play is that I think you are a very arrogant player at times who says things that insult people's intelligence at times - like you did with frogger - and I find it disconcerting that rb went on that rant about nacho and was lovey dovey with you, especially when it's suggested you don't always get along.  I'm wondering what that means for his alignment and yes yours.

I am well within my rights as a player to point out when something feels wrong, that's my textual reality.  If you guys have a different interaction than I expect feel free to talk to me about it.  I talked to you, and gave you links and other game information, to show why you were wrong about the nacho/implosion/Tammy odd interaction you've gone on about.



You don't feel solvey and engaged.  You feel like you are doing enough to stay present and that's it.  If you didn't feel detached I wouldn't say you feel detached.  most of your reads stem from the first few pages, save your new radical theory.  I don't see you trying to form town reads and get your town reads to work together, which I thought was your thing.

I don't know why you added in the third sentence unless you're trying to be snide or something?  I don't care if you think I'm off.  That does not affect my read in you at all.  What I do find suspicious about the whole thing is that you keep kind of limpily bringing up the interaction thing and stuff from the first few pages of the game, but nothing from after that.  You just muttering it every now and then but doing really nothing to figure it out is what's bugging me.

I find you suspicious, and you are one of my top priorities to sort.  If you're town, show me.



Hiraki asked you a question, you only answered half of it and YOU said that you were still sorting.  Hiraki followed that up with ""I know you're still sorting, but can you answer x"".  Meaning that he was acknowledging what you had said - you're still sorting - but can you expand.

That does not in any universe, not even moon logic universe, equate to knowledge that you're town because only town sort.  Hiraki was carrying on a conversation in the typical way humans do, acknowledging what you've said and following up.  It doesn't imply knowledge, it doesn't imply tmi, it doesn't imply a slip, it's just conversation.  

If he's scum he's not scum for that.  Do you have anything better?  (And by the way you did technically dodge his questions.  You didn't answer everything asked, you didn't expand on some of the things he asked you to expand on.)",71697,2017-05-07 00:54:00,1646

So I mean yeah, I'm shoving a town read down Nacho's throat and it's because my play becomes 10fold accurate when we jam together.

This is fair.  The first half of day one is like that for me too usually.  It's why I told frogger that im good with less town cohesion right now because my reads develop better this way.  I'm also indecisive as fuck so you probably won't see me actually settle on a scum read until near the end of the second half of day one.  Also because I'm juggling and contemplating a lot of possibilities I'm trying to figure out which make the most sense.  Basically I'm just that super analytical type that takes her time.

I too work best when I have a touchstone.  I'm just lucky here that nacho was doing his obvtown game from the start, so I've already had that touchstone since page two or so.  I think the last time I read him this quickly and confidently was a game at my homesite, so that's been nice.

I know that game and I followed that jam, jealously, we'd literally not been town-town together in a game for almost a year.  I also gave scum him too much of a pass day one in laundry mafia because I knew how much he was working on that game.

For me, I want to be able to put you away if you're town because while I like some posts you've made, you're a question mark that I'd like resolved as I'm working on which of my worlds make the most sense.",71697,2017-05-07 01:37:00,1655

4925,Titus,"@Tammy, I am but I have also accepted that I cannot get any further than something feels off about you right now. Asking me to elaborate four or five times on a statement I told you I literally cannot elaborate on is a great way to just make noise, look busy, and get players to tune out. Like, I am pretty sure HL is scum at this point, and I think Fire's townread on Boon is wrong, but I need more time to sort it out. The trade-off for me not tunnelling is me documenting feelings I have that are inexplicable and try to move on from them. I know no one will sheep my read of ""something's off"", but a feeling doesn't come with discussable rationale just because I'd like it to. Figuring out why you act like you did takes flips.

Now, if you take that as a discredit, that's your own issue. I haven't discredited you at all. I just won't clear you until I am sure you're clear.

Yes. But those reads are filtered through Fire scum. Your reflexive impulse to just murder me for knowing Fire is town also isn't townie.

I don't think town-boon should have that point as his go-to when he wants to list a reason why fb is scum; it's not actually a strong scum-indicative reason, especially in isolation, and boon should know that.

I believe I asked you once to explain what felt off about the interaction with nacho/implosion/me and you said you couldn't verbalize it.  I never asked you to elaborate on it again.

See this is again why communication between us breaks down because you say I'm doing stuff I'm not doing.  You wonder why we are unable to get along in games, why you infuriate me so much and you keep doing it.  You just frankly do not read my posts.

What I have said is that if you feel off about me, you should be sorting me.  Your whole thing is that something seemed off in the beginning, something that bothered you on page 3.  It is now about page 70 and you haven't done anything with it.  I asked you what you thought of what Nacho has done outside of that beginning there and you didn't answer it.

You then decided to discredit my suspicion on you as it being because you said I was off and you don't have me lock town.  When my suspicion on you started very very early with your first few posts.  I've talked about my suspicion on you and that it continues because you don't seem like your sorting.

I don't need you to explain what you think is off about me.  I don't need you to explain something you've said you can't elaborate or verbalize.  I do need to see you actually trying to sort the game.  That's what I haven't seen, and that thing you did with Boonskies does not help.  That did not look like you trying to sort him, that looked like you trying to make him look bad.  That does not make me think you're town.

No, pretty sure I've had those same thoughts about people in games quite often.

I think that when someone is trying to policy lynch you just for being you then it's personal and can make you think irrationally about that person.  Boon skies accepts that he's a VI, but he's also very proud of his game and that he can become obvtown and solve the game in the late game. 

But mostly when someone is calling you town and saying you need to be policy lynched for the good of the town, it makes people react irrationally and emotionally.  (Wake and Waynegg behaved similarly when I did the same thing to them once in a game.  Had them both policy lynched and vigged in a game because they were literally destroying the town.  Even after game, when we won, even years later they yelled about it.)",71697,2017-05-07 17:35:00,1742

The main reason why I didn't point out that fire bringer can be town and want to policy lynch a town read was because boon skies was obviously taking that personally and it would not have been productive at all.  I was just hoping the argument would die out.

Oh I'll find that scum game of boon skies that I looked at the other day though it might be moot with the replace in.

also, implosion it would be nice that if you're going to keep sheeping nacho's vote on titus that you looked like you were trying to sort her yourself.",71697,2017-05-07 17:39:00,1743

5038,Tammy,"My most salient points:

Town is in Nacho, Firebringer, Arthur (Boonskies) and outliers of Gin and possibly alisae.

My concerns are Titus are:

Spoiler:  The beginning of the game she thought that nacho/implosion and my interaction was off, with most of her suspicion centered on Implosion and Nacho somewhat.  She has muttered about this interaction being off but has done nothing with it.  She said it was suspicious that Nacho had only given a couple reasons why he town read me so strongly and that is was based on meta she can't touch.  (She has enough experience with the both of us to be able to prod at it.)  That was reasoning given on about page 26 of the game.  Almost fifty pages later she hasn't asked for an update or for him to expand.  The lack of prodding or attempting to sort the players that she read as off since the beginning of the game is concerning.

Both of these players she's had somewhat troubles with have voted for her.  Nacho voted without any reasoning.  And Implosion sheeped nacho and isn't even pretending to try to sort Titus.  She hasn't even blinked at these votes, which should be very odd for her.

Then some pages back, without any attempt to sort these players she finds off who are voting her for no reason at all, she changes gears.  She omgus's hikari for a silly reason and then comes up with her new scum team of hiker/boonskies/Gin even though earlier she was town reading boon.  She then purposefully* antagonized boon skies in a conversation this morning and boon skies interpretation looks actually legit.  Titus is the leading wagon right now.  Boon skies is the next wagon, and it looks like she was looking for a way to scum read boon skies so she can get on his wagon to deflect the wagon from herself.  That is sheer opportunism.

She's staying here enough to look present but doesn't look like she's trying to figure out the game.  She's not trying to sort the people who she claims to have issues with she's just kind of muttering about them.  I don't see her trying to form town reads and get her town reads to work together, which is her thing.  She claims part of the reason is because she's trying not to tunnel or deal with people who annoy her.  But she's not even sorting.  And she was the 11th person to sign up for this game; if there were annoying people here she didn't have to sign up, so that just looks like a cop out.

*It looks purposeful to me.

The only reason I'm not pushing this as hard as I'd like to is because I'd like to not be wrong here.  Titus and I are never town together and she said in the sign up thread she hoped we were town together and I'd hoped so too.  I've been hoping if she is town, she'd become apparent that she's town so that we could work together.  But she's not doing that and she doesn't feel town at all.",71697,2017-05-08 00:07:00,1784

You're assuming what I'd do based on a game dynamic when I haven't even figured out what I'd do or the optimal move. I cannot get reads from Boonskiies yelling like he did.

5044,Titus,"As for why Fire's town, I've been playing with Fire as long as you've played with Nacho. He can't carry a tune in a bucket as scum. He's jovial and joking around, but I can follow his joking. We generally mind meld and if I had a mind this game, we would be that close.",71697,2017-05-08 00:15:00,1790
5045,Hikari Link,"Boon seems like he misrepped the fuck out of Firebringer. A lot. And he kept saying Firebringer was scum with such confidence so many times. Plus, his constant referring to himself as confirmed town bothers me. That absolutism doesn't sit well with me. 

As for Firebringer, his relative uselessness for the whole time and his willingness to permavote Boon, even when he admitted Boon was probably town, is super suspect.

Though it did get heated. Like, really heated, regardless of what either party said, there was some heat there. It honestly didn't help me read either and it killed my motivation to read the game for several days. Boon definitely looked the worse of the two, but that's probably because I have much lower expectations of Firebringer at this point, based on his current contributions. I hear he picks up after Day 1 though, so I'll be expecting more from him if he sticks around before I make any further judgments on his usefulness.

Ultimately, I'm unsure on both, but Boon looks scummier. Somebody present a case why he's not scummy, because I don't see how he's the towniest town that ever towned.

@Firebringer: After this game is over, there's something I want to ask you about your playstyle. I'll try to remember, but please try too, cause I'm forgetful. Hopefully, one of us will remember.

Now I really should do my homework. Get back to it later. Maybe nit until tomorrow, because there is a lot of ground to cover.",71697,2017-05-08 00:18:00,1791
5046,Tammy,"I'm not talking down to you at all.  I suspect you, but I'm nowhere near lock scum read.  If you're town and I'm wrong on my suspicions I want to see that.

And when I try to just take you out of the equation, I keep coming back to how they intersect concerning you.  If that makes sense.

I don't care that you were gone for a whole day; I'm never going to expect people to be here every day.  I'm not usually here everyday; this week has been the exception mostly because of the lull before finals week.

These are some of the weak reasons that I wanted to get to, but wasn't sure if they're a product of experience or alignment.

First off, I posted a link to a boon skies scum game here:





Other than that I think that Boon got very offended at being called a policy lynch, that or he thought it was someone who was trying to lynch him for being a VI.  People do that and I think he got very confirmation biasy because of it.

Firebringer admitting that his policy lynch was a policy lynch is not alignment relevant.  Probably more likely town for it due to him scum reading boon before hand and then thinking he was town for it but needed to be lynched for the good of the town.  I've talked about this earlier today.  Town do lynch people they think are town and detrimental to town from time to time.",71697,2017-05-08 00:32:00,1805

Unless you and fire bringer come from another site together dating a few years back, then not as long, no.  Do you have a record of reading him accurately?

there's a lot of things that people can and do fake, but there are some behaviors that people don't and won't due to alignment.  His scum game shows him being far more in control than the town games I've seen of him.

Okay. Not sure if that came later or if I just skimmed it while rereading you bicker. Either way, both of you seemed to be getting into a spammy, emotional battle that really seemed to have more to do with a disagreement about rb's motivations for replacing, rather than the game itself. I don't mind too people arguing, but when it gets bitter and repetitive like that, it makes other people bitter and makes the game less fun.

Spoiler: @Alisae 
It's not meant to dodge the question. It's legitimately what I think. The reason I like forum-based Mafia is because I can compose myself and pick my words carefully. When I talk in real life, I have a hard time gathering my thoughts and feel rushed. The reason I hate it though is because everybody else can do that and it makes it harder to tell what's real and what's fabricated.

Spoiler: @Tammy Can you elaborate? Both in terms of why the reasoning is why and why it is indicative of experience or alignment, please.


What are some of these things that people don't and won't do? Because the only stuff I can't see being faked is stuff that'd be really elaborate to fake, in terms of emotions.

Notes/Thoughts from catchup:

Spoiler:  - Alisae still scum (why you get scum alisae  ). Everything reads kinda hostile where it looks like he's more interested in defending himself rather than actually scumhunting, and when he does give reads they look very fake and it doesn't look like he actually believes in them rather than just pushing something with ~FORCE~ to look town.
- Rb obnxious posts, but through and under those obnoxiousness are very contrived opinions and fake attempts at looking town. His imitating of nacho just didn't read as a town who's frustrated with being left out rather than him using it to try and look obvtown and buddy in the process.
- Nacho is making me paranoid in some places like the helping out hikari catch up it's a lot similar to what he did to Tammy in laundry where he tried to appease her. I feel like he's not doing it to Tammy because she's gonna notice it after a recent game but he's trying to buddy another. Though tbh he has those NACHOHUNTING bursts that he does more as town I think because he just gets lazy af from what I've seen of his scum game.
- Titus I was townreading early for her calling out the tammy nacho implosion because while I didn't really agree with it I felt it was super genuine. But then Ari attacked that post which felt super weak and Titus called him out on it so + points.
- Firebringer's alisae read is reading organic and the progession looks genuine.
- Frogger is lacking the vigor and drive from laundry. Like holy Frogger's 673 is just a word salad and super wishy wash. And it just feels so scum theater with Alisae.
- Ugh Gin's posts with him getting angry read fake but then his post earlier looked like he was genuinely pushing from a town scumhunting angle.
- Keyser's posts are annoying me why are they in a larger font, and she doesn't look like she was trying to game solve with her catch up posts rather than just responding to random things. Though that's not scummy (and I feel like a scum would at least try to look like they're gamesolving rather than random responses?), that's just being near-useless. 
- I'm actually liking the Gin interaction with rb where rb is just trolling and dodging.
- Ari vs Hikari catchup/reaction to large amounts of posts is exactly how scum vs town react. Whereas Hikari's reaction felt genuine and then she attempted to read up (and her response to nacho about not feeling comfortable leaving so many pages unread), Ari's posts just feel like him getting unmotivated by so many pages similar to how unmotivated I was by the amount of pages when I was scum in Masquerade ball.
- Alisae's Keyser felt low hanging. Rb actually called him out on it so I'll give him that, even though I can see it as scum on scum even though ik people will prob call me out on confirmation bias.
- Ari's posts are so bad. Rb and implosion calling him out on it is good.
- I legit think that Keyser read list (961) is random.orged. Only think I agree with is the scumread on Alisae and townread on Boonskiies.
- This was one of the reasons Tammy was obvtowning in the beginning/middle but she's doing it a bit again but the defending/try to explain how nacho plays/works is extremely town-motivated from her.
- Holy moly those Ari posts. Can't tell if too scummy to be scum or he's just doing that on purpose, but they just lack actual ~content~.
- Really dislike Prism's Boonskiies vote.
- Wow super good Hikari 1102. I don't agree with the Firebringer and Titus scumreads. The former is likely 100% because she has no experience with Firebringer because everything she described is just regular firebringer. I also don't agree with the townreads on alisae/frogger obv but I skipped the explanation for why she townread them because it was too long.
- Skimmed past the boonskiies/firebringer argument b/c I'm not about that life
- I don't understand the Titus wagon and tbh her 1494 is p much the OMGUS I expect from townTitus.
- Pages 62-63 frogger posting is all over the place and the vote hopping doesn't read like natural progression.
- Alisae 1598 titus vote opportunistic this Titus wagon has like no real reasoning behind it...
- Prism with that 0 content and the request to ""if someone wants to help me out to interact so I can get in this game"" always just feels scummy because if someone really wanted to gamesolve then there's a lot of content they can read throughand try to get a feel for.
- Ohhh I think I forgot this earlier but I was townreading implosion from while I was still spectating b/c of his early interaction with Tammy. It was ~weird~ but it really didn't feel ~scum-motivated~.",71697,2017-05-08 02:09:00,1828

It's the same thing I pull off when I'm scum, I'm really just not interested in reading a lot of pages so it's easier for me to just complain about the amount of pages or how dense the game is and then ask people to interact with me. It's easier to hide in interaction than it is to go through a bunch of posts and commit to hard reads as scum, whereas a townie is delighted to have that much game content to sit down and go through to figure out the scum.

It's not even about the AMOUNT there is. You can sit down and read 10 pages. Or 20. Or however much you have time for. But the point is there's JUICY CONTENT there. Scum just don't care to read it whatsoever.

5134,Prism,"Spoiler: Dayne posts 
I think there are a few things worth commenting on here. I'll divide them into two separate groups, with the first being my questions about it and the second being more personal comments.

Spoiler:  Firstly, my understanding of your point is that you seem to think town is more likely to catch up. This appears to be based more off of what you yourself do, as well as an intuitive guess. Applying it to me seems a reasonable step. My issue is that this seems to be more effort-based than anything else. The logic here is that scum don't want to try as hard, whereas town is eager to, which is a bit of a fallacy. The goal of most scum players is to seem town, which comes via effort and reading etc, which gets you into a bit of a circular loop. I realize it's a bit more nuanced than this, in that there are reasons to coast as scum but very rarely as town, but none of these factors are really at play here. Without trying to strawman, it appears as though you're drawing a very direct line between effort rereading and mafia. Specifically, what scum incentive do you envision I have to not post Hikari-style, knowing it is more likely to be townread?

My second comment is that I think you've misunderstood my posts. I fully intend to read and use every post in this game at some point. My trouble is that it is extremely hard for me to read for alignment in large groups of postings. I can indeed read 5-6 pages (Typically my magic number) at a time, but this will leave me very well behind and largely irrelevant to the game at hand. My strategic suggestion was not to start with a blank slate but instead to narrow my focus by giving me a starting point to trampoline off of in my read. To draw a comparison, here's a study on selection of jams based on the variety available. The implicit assumption of most people is that choice is empowering, when in reality it can be overwhelming. As the variety of options to pick from goes up, the ease of choice becomes much harder and you're often paralyzed just wondering how you got there. What I'm essentially asking people to do is to narrow my choice of jams to 2-3 good ones, and then expand from there. Right now I'm looking at a bunch of different jams and not really knowing where to start, because chronologically seems to be leaving me the choice of either permanent irrelevancy or mindless skimming. Think of a tree, where you start me from a seed or trunk and I expand out on my own from there, both in roots downward and in branches outward.",71697,2017-05-08 03:49:00,1880

What people's individual play is scum though.

It's not that it's hard to say or show that you care (although there can prob be an argument made about how genuine people react to the amount of posts but let's leave that for a sec), it's that it's hard to actually DO read and commit to solid reads whereas the benefit of interacting is a) looking active and contributing and b) much easier to hide in, buddy people, get into arguments that make you look town, etc. 


No, this was exactly what I'm saying.

You can take any number of pages at any point in the game and get reads off of them - because people's alignment doesn't change over the course of the game. But from you it looked like you started trying to read, but then quickly saw it was futile because you had no interest in figuring people's alignment out, and copped out for the easier and more beneficial route.

The other major problem I had with your post is that it looked like you were ASKING people to interact with you, rather than you creating the conversation and probing around. Which, again, is not town-motivated. Town wants to figure the game out. Scum want to go ""see look I'm town and active"".",71697,2017-05-08 04:05:00,1887
5142,Prism,"@Titus: Skimming your ISO it looks like your number one choice is Hikari-can I get some elaboration on that?

Ctrl+F searching their name gets me these two posts:

Spoiler: First This seems a bit of a stretch to me. The sorting point doesn't really make sense and is putting the chicken before the egg. HL knows you're sorting but that doesn't say anything as to whether or not it's genuine, ie. whether you're scum or town. Fundamentally I don't get the issue here.Spoiler: Second The first seems to be a matter of perception to me, rather than inherently scummy. It seems a plausible enough mistake as town, especially if he really managed to sift through all that. Part of my problem is I clearly was unable to keep anything straight when I tried to do it so quickly. The Nacho point in my opinion is a good one, it might be a bit unfair or loaded but it is really just asking you to take a clearer stance on what you think of Nacho in regards to Tammy.

Is there something more convincing I'm missing, or do you have a different scumread?",71697,2017-05-08 04:08:00,1888
5143,Prism,"Spoiler:  I think this is a very one-dimensional characterization that is summed up a bit in your point b. Interaction is inherently a pro-town action from the get-go, you don't just ""get into arguments that make you look town"" as scum and it's really that simple. You've got to get into arguments about something, and those somethings tend to be the solid reads you state that town should be looking for. I'm trying for the most part to stay away from meta but I think several players here can vouch that I definitely do my best work, readwise, interpersonally. I think my opening post and those that follow cement exactly why I've pursued this path over others.
This is largely ignoring the plausible other explanation for why I consider it futile, which I get considering that you scumread the rb slot anyway. However, I take some issue with you excluding the rest of my post. It lays out exactly why I chose to do what I did, and even more exactly lays out the path ahead for myself I have envisioned. All of the things you're looking for are included in this vision-solid reads, solving the game with past information, and more.

The final part is puzzling. The point was that I was struggling to find a good starting point, and wanted assistance with it. I was indeed asking people to interact with me, and was very open about it, but it was a lot more than ""I'm town and active"". My open question is the perfect conversation creator. I asked for a concrete starting point that I would immediately set out to review and reflect on. It is mutually beneficial to do so. I'm immediately giving you a blank check for deciding what I look at and respond to. If I am scum, I am forced to interact with it, take a stance on it, and respond in a seemingly organic way. If I am town, it clearly shows me your viewpoint, provides me a good starting point necessary for my playstyle, and gets me involved in the game extremely quickly. The idea that I'm not probing also seems questionable-how do you characterize my attempt to get more out of Firebringer? My instinct is that you'll draw up a distinction between ""good"" and ""bad"" probing, but I really fail to see any way that you could say that I'm disinterested in either Fire or his read on Alisae.

Fundamentally, this boils down to how I approach the game, and I get how you can scumread it for the surface level, which is why I said it wasn't a shocker. The point of this extrapolation is to get you to realize why I think such an approach is optimal. Restated, this is again that I'm poor at reading in bulk, and devised a way around this that incorporates the past in a more manageable, focused way that gets me immediately reading people without getting lost. This way, and why I think it will work, is described more extensively in the above.",71697,2017-05-08 04:40:00,1889
5144,Prism,"Summarized (though I really recommend you read it in full) your main critiques seem to be (and correct me if I'm wrong) that it avoids giving reads, avoids gamesolving based off of past information, and is looking for raw interaction over either of the former. 

The first two are clearly laid out for how I am going to achieve them in a way that's more effective to me as a player. You can go further and say that I hadn't achieved them, but this was before it had even begun (we're in the middle of it) and would not be a fair argument. The last seems fallacious-scum want to interact because it looks town, but town want to interact because it is an extremely powerful way to achieve the stated goals of getting reads and gamesolving.",71697,2017-05-08 04:46:00,1890

I am very salty that no one was willing to really toss me a bone because again, this was a perfect chance for you as well, not just for me.

Spoiler:  Titus shares a similar observation as I had on nacho. 
Some surface level confusion/frustration expressed here.
I like Titus asking for Nacho's reads twice, something I have noticed nacho is less vocal about.
Ask Nacho how his implosion read ""evolved"" - Titus looks curious to unpick her associations-theory.
Titus again asks Nacho about how his read of implosion has developed. Titus won't let this drop.
Titus doesn't understand Alisae's position on him. Healthy read-scrutiny which I always like to see.
Titus still doesn't like the implosion-Nacho relationship and the timing/nature of their town-read of eachother.
This paranoia turns into genuinely wanting implosion dead. I can see the confusion and the paranoia. Nothing feels forced here, just very focused.
Titus asking Alisae for his read on implosion. Titus has got her bone and won't let it go.
Titus is equally confused about Gin's 'give-a-shit-don't-give-a-shit-reads-list'.
""Implosion isn't lock scum but those interactions just don't feel right."" I love the balanced/take-a-step-back conclusion from Titus here.
Titus is still obsessed on the ""the early interactions between nacho and implosion"". Titus is really committed to this narrative and wants everybody's view on it.
I feel Titus' vote on Hikari is more insulted-fueled. I genuinely see Titus being annoyed by her early theory-work being 'mis-repped' by Hikari. I'd prefer to see Titus look more closer at Hikari's ISO outside of his interaction with her. Are those scum-feels weakened or strengthened?

Titus wants Boonskiies to share reads outside of his Fire-scum read. Cute and productive. Sadly Titus had zero effect in reasoning with Boonskiies.
Don't like Titus ruling out wagoning a player twice.
""I'm never getting a lynch I want with this crowd. I'll just settle for not terrible or me."" I echo this sentiment.


Conclusion:

Still leaning town on Titus.
She needs to open up her focus on every slot now (my only real concern): but it looks like Titus focuses on close-associations so this is understandable.
I now want to look at the votes on Titus' leading D1 wagon.

Poor timing, poor reason, poor vote. You have more passion/content/focus on scum-Keyser, yet your vote is on Titus for (what alignment indicative reasons)?

Is Titus a null-read then?
If so, where is the effort to sort their slot?
It looks to me, you have no desire to 'scum-hunt' and have opportunistically settled on a player who is not town read by the mass.

I asked if there was anything else.

Yes, I argued agains the nacho read and interaction and again directed her to a past game where the interaction was very similar to show that the perception was wrong.  This is a read I will shout down.  I read nacho very well, and I will put my foot down about this one, but it does not mean I am not open to listening to your read and reasons because it will help me read you.

Alisae is my strongest scum-read of the three as there are tangible items to highlight from his ISO.

I was hoping for both Nacho and Gin to explore/explain their scum-reads in explicit detail first (if any have developed), before I presented a 'full' case to the thread.



It is important I share my read on every slot. Even the slots I town-read.

- I cannot say I have a strong meta-knowledge on his ""town"" tone. Does Nacho have a definitive town-tone you can easily notice? As scum, does he not have the ability to imitate his tone?

- Nacho did argue that he was interacting with Gin (which was a point I could not contest, as he was being actively inquisitive with the slot). However, in my eyes Nacho never escalated this suspicion/doubt to a vote. Looking back, it may have been feeding into my Gin-Nacho scum-theory. The way he later cross-examines Alisae more recently too without landing a final punch or bottom line read also made be suspicious. My tldr take on this is: this is gentle scum-distancing. 

- My perspective of this was that Nacho was clutching at straws, and used this meta-read to land a forced vote on fro99er. Obviously, as soon as fro99er starts posting the whole argument falls apart (as it was based on activity, which in my book is non alignment indicative to begin with anyway. Sometimes there are hidden motives for big posters to stay quiet or even IRL issues). The only thing I can defend Nacho with is: it's early D1 - thus, scum reads won't be backed up with deep substance. I can understand this.

- regarding Nacho's defence of Alisae, I feel he town-read Alisae's 'frustration' too easily. Nacho couldn't see the scum-motivation in Alisae dropping his fro99er case so easy only to jump on Boonskiies right after. But Alisae's case on fro99er was without momentum or substance, so I didn't buy that argument.

- safe game: read the town players as town. Don't make any large ripples, and vote/scum-read the players who are a viable wagon. I am yet to see Nacho really push through a scum-read. Calling town players town is easy (some possible cases of TMI), but the more I see Nacho follow through with a scum read, I think the better I'll be able to get my head around his alignment.

Spoiler:  Yes, I can.  No, he does not have the ability to imitate his town-tone as scum, not for what I look for.  He can try for a little bit, but it doesn't hold up well.  I can read nacho very very well.  Most recently, in Keybladewielder's game (Prism hydrad with Nacho), I scumread nacho during our first interaction because his interaction with me was wrong.  In OOTS, I weakly town read nacho at first but by the end of day one accurately scum read him.  In Laundry mafia, I held optimistic hope that he was town after he mediated a fight, but day two I scum read him.  In Gay Mafia, I townread him early but got paranoid he was scum because he seemed to hand wave my suspicions, which is what he does a lot as scum when I scum read his partners, but he was town.

His motivation when scum is different than as town and that comes across easily.  I read him based on tone, interaction with me, then how he's looking at the game.  All of this is his town game.



I'd say that here his approach to people is different based on who they are.  Nacho can interrogate one person while having his vote on another.  I believe at the time he was scum reading frogger and sorting that out while still questioning gin and expressing feeling a bit off.  I can't imagine scum!nacho being afraid of voting Gin early when he could easily move it off.  Regarding Alisae, I think he was trying to shore up his read there.  And as a side note - he's worked a hell of a lot of overtime the past week, I don't think he'll be making any substantive posts until later today or tomorrow.



If you think you have a meta tell on someone and they are appearing to show that tell then you push it.  I've seen frogger be very active as scum, and I was very suspicious of his early play.  Other than that, yes early reads are early reads.  I don't know why he wouldn't push it.



Nacho reads people as strongly town pretty early and has people get after him for town reading too many people too early.  nacho works around his town reads.  He reads things like frustration or tone and determines whether or not he thinks it's town.



Nacho works around town reads.  He'll get feels based on things he picks up as scum, but mostly he solves by getting his town reads first and settling there working out from that.  I have faith you'll see the pushing through a scum read thing when he can get back into the game with full force.",71697,2017-05-08 16:25:00,1978

My impression of the Nacho/implosion first pages were that it seemed entirely normal for a town Nacho and weird for a town implosion, so I get how she characterized them as ""off"". I've only got one game with implosion, where he was town and I was mafia, and he was noticeably more different. I chalked this difference up mainly to a difference in characters present, as I have noticed that Nacho (and it seems Tammy) drastically change interpersonal dynamics. I'm also just not confident in my memory from a game months ago that I was scum in anyway.

I agree that the push on Hikari was really bad, but I wouldn't characterize it as scummy. There's a difference between a bad case and a malicious case, and this seems more like the former. (I'm talking primarily about their comments with regards to sorting-I don't think she'd have made those as scum if she knew they were fallacious. It was likely unintentional.) This doesn't really affect my read on Titus but I think Tammy's characterization of Titus simply muttering rather than actively trying to sort is also inaccurate, skimming Titus's ISO I've seen numerous followups/attempts to extract more, especially early on with Implosion and later with Hikari.

You explicitly state that Nacho is ""someone you can read better than anyone."" While this is likely a fact, the implication of it is that other's opinions on him are inherently less valuable or valid. This again can be completely true but it is definitely discrediting Titus. I think her reaction here feels town in the sense that she's not saying you're discrediting her from a scum place, but rather something you're doing as town that she thinks you should stop.

5345,Prism,"My top vote right now would probably be Gin whose play is wildly different from what I've experienced from him as town. It feels like an empty shell of the genuine effort he'd make in other games. Particularly, the efforts to engage or extract from others that I've seen are either nonexistent or ring incredibly hollow.

VOTE: Gin

Dayne's recent posts on me still aren't great as far as reasoning goes, and in particular he seems to be mostly moving the goalposts. The first issue was my choice of method that was more likely to come from scum, the second was that I promised content but hadn't given it. The problem with the second is that it's prejudging that it's not there before I was given anywhere close to adequate time.

This did read legitimately to me and combined with my read on Gin is enough for me to shift over:Spoiler:  There's a two things I really like about this and one I don't but honestly doesn't matter. The first is the possibility of confirmation bias, which I think explains the moving goalpost and presupposition. Viewed from this lens it makes sense and I think it'd be quite a leap to expect me to make this connection about how it's manifested and expect it as scum. The second I like is the characterization of me as forced, because this is absolutely true, I'm forcing myself to a great extent, in attitude, in the style of play I'm trying to cultivate and in the way I'm forcing myself to be more honest than I normally am. This is not my regular town play. If you're again confused as to why I would admit this or do this, again my opening post #937 lays out what changes I'm trying to make and why. This leads into the minor issue I take with it, which is I don't think what I'm doing could ever be described as manipulative in an underhanded sense. Either I am being completely, totally honest with everything or I am lying to pretend I am. There's no real room for more subtle or underhanded motive with the way I've chosen to play. Again, this minor negative doesn't really factor into reading Dayne-it seems mostly an extension of the ""forced"" perception.

tl;dr: Dayne's last post on me is good and I should probably vote elsewhere (*cough* Gin *cough*) pending more reading of Boon.",71697,2017-05-08 17:41:00,2091

The strongest reason to think she's town is simply that Nacho thinks so, and I trust that 100% given what he's said about her to me in the past. Even if he's mafia he knows, or at least thinks inwardly, that going against her is committing suicide. Part of my wariness of Nacho this game is that I know he's desperate to get Tammy to townread him when he flips mafia and I basically keep seeing shadows in the corner of some of his posts that seem to be angling for it. Some of them I thought more about and they were stupid, but if my perception was correct and they really are/were there then it confirms Tammy is town.

This is a really terrible reason but I also just like her read on me early. She knows from Nacho that my scumgame is not to be undersold but seemed to realize the honesty present in my early posts. It's possible she's townreading me to get Nacho to pull her back and seem legitimate and fool him in turn, but I think this is unlikely.

Tier list

Tammy, Hikari
Firebringer, Titus, 
Nacho, Gin, Frogger, implosion
Keyser, Prism
Alisae, Ari

Spoiler:  - Prism up b/c we probably have very drastic playstyles and I need to adjust to what is contrived for the sake of being unique and new playstyle and what is b/c scum. I also notice the recent buddying up to me but tbh there's a few genuine bits I like.
- Frogger up because I actually liked some parts in my recent interaction with him. Some of his reads still don't feel like they're a natural progression, but I liked the explanation to me about how his Keyser read is more than just meta.
- Keyser down mainly because of the interaction with Frogger, but I also get the feel he's trying to be original for the sake of being original and looking like he has unique reads and thoughts. I don't feel like he's doing much with the things he pushes for rather than using them to look townie.
- Ari down because that is just not town posting. He is actively lurking while sharing enough thoughts in his ISO to remain relevant and not be policied as a lurker lynch while also having no concrete thoughts. And some of his posts are super fake.
- Implosion down because I forgot he's in the game and I'm really interested in what he has to say about the recent wagon.

I feel like if I can get to a point where I think Nacho is town it will make the game super easy to PoE. Not only will I not have to worry about the slot itself but it will also allow me to have a strong place to bounce ideas off of.

Yeah, well you haven't been listening Tammy. You've read. You've tried to listen, but you're no better than Math in that regard. I told you how I scumhunt. I've directed you to places on how I read. I'll never be normal or normal with emotions and put great work into improving reading tone and emotion. Do I get it right? No, but there is a reason I hate D1. If I get a lock scumread, it's probably wrong. So I just leave it at a pool and let my townreads pick.

The way you've treated me is that you know Nacho better than I do, so it's ok if he whiteknights you. No it isn't. It's not ok that Nacho has been a non-entity. You might be able to tone read each other because you know each other for years. I never will. Prism picked up on the same thing, and you had conflict with Prism.

Your implosion read is mud because you want implosion to be town but the only thing he's done is defend you and Nacho.

5506,Tammy,"

In Laundry Mafia he mediated an argument because that's who he is.  If he sees me getting really upset in a game, he's going to want to help.  He does that quite often for a lot of people regardless of alignment sometimes.  OOTS is a good example of what he looks like when he buddies me at the start of the game in a scummy way.

As far as him not being here, I fully expect him to be here today or tomorrow.  He's just worked a metric shit ton of overtime the past few days.

His interaction with me at the start of the game wasn't buddying and it wasn't ignoring.  He still hasn't quite got the hang of how to interact with me the right amount when he's scum.  Here he did.

But beyond that and what's better and more convincing is the amount of game-solvey he was right from the start.  Those types of detailed reads and jumping in feet first and pushing the game are far more indicative of his town game.  If you look at that meta read case on frogger, that's one example of it.  As town he wants to push reads and figure things out and if he finds a bone he pushes it.  He might have pushed frogger as scum, but not developed the early game case that he did.  The other things are him popping in when he doesn't have much time to shore up reads or interact with people even if it's in a limited way.  His popping in to ask Alisae a couple questions but not do a whole lot with it, looks like him seeing something he wanted to figure out if it was off or not.",71697,2017-05-08 20:32:00,2252

This is what happened, yes!
However, you seem to be pieces of context which I've talked about in here. You seem to be acting like this is something that happened midgame but it happened in the beginning stages when the game was just starting. If this is something that still bothers you, why not give it a full response? You gave it something along the lines of ""agree to disagree"" but I think it's perfectly possible for you to go more in depth than that - what is unbelievable about my making a not-serious vote on implosion early and then townreading him for his posting made after the vote?


This is a perfectly valid criticism, but I think that's a thought you would have if you were town in Gay Mafia with us as well! 


This is not quite was she was trying to say here. 
Even though she says she can't understand your problems with my townread on you, she's not saying that she wants you to ignore the interactions between us. In fact, what she actually ended up saying was the complete opposite of ""plug your nose to our circle jerk"":

I can understand feeling frustrated when it feels like you're not allowed to express what you believe without fear of starting a conflict or being shut down, but I don't believe that's what's happening here.  Tammy's problem with your early game was precisely that you were plugging your nose to the circle jerk (which is an unfortunate misunderstanding); this posting is encouraging you to push, to prod, to sort your feelings because the town!Titus that we both know and love doesn't let things that bother her to this extent just fester.

Tbh most of it was putting on a show to try to get her to open up more emotionally because she felt very robotic. Her responses didn't actually solve that problem for me, but at least they made me feel better in terms of the posts not being contrived as opposed to a playstyle.

The slot is still a scumread because I'm carrying a strong scumread over from Rb. It's not really fair for the next player replacing in and I honestly understand that, but I'm not gonna drop suspicion of the slot instead of start evaluating the player from a lower point than null.

(Her post asking to engage did give me a bad gut vibe - I might've exaggerated the explanation but deep down it still doesn't sit right with me).

Alisae early game gave me very bad gut vibe. The closest way I can put it into words is that time I was playing with WJ as House Hunter (I think that was the alt) and people started pressuring me and I started reacting very badly to the push and generally being very hostile.

However one thing early on that gave me very good gut vibes was the amount of scum hunting he was doing, so I definitely agree with that point and it kinda calms down my paranoia of him. The reason I started worrying was because he wasn't here, and me not being in the game at the time he was scumhunting made me feel it was harder to judge the actual ~presence~ he had.

But I'm really looking forward to you being around now Nacho!

It's less that I don't think that was something scum-Gin could do and more that I think he wouldn't. I don't think that scum extend themselves out so far pretty much immediately because it's a fairly dumb thing to do; I think scum are more self-conscious about the cases that they're pushing and I don't think that Gin would be so incredibly concerned about looking like he was scumhunting that he would jump on me and Tammy for not interacting immediately if he were scum, hence ""overexcited Gin"".

Okay this might be a bit complicated.  The mediating in and of itself is NAI.  I guess sometimes the way he does it and why could be alignment indicative, but that's a part of the read process with him that I've not considered because I read him elsewhere.  I just know that he does mediate as town too.

The way he buddies people could be alignment indicative, and yeah probably is.  But he quite often as town will do what he did with hiraki in which he wants to help people get adjusted in the game and if he can do something to help he will.  I think this one is hard to explain and is something that you have to see him do it as town and as scum a few times in his several ways to find which way is alignment indicative.

This answer probably isn't that helpful because these are things that are harder to describe, but I think with hiraki he legitimately didn't want him to replace out because the game was difficult do to people knowing each other and wanted to give him a foot hold in the game so he didn't feel so left out.",71697,2017-05-09 02:52:00,2296

I modded that game!  I don't remember the alt though, but I remember the game.  I did read Alisae's early game as off.  The mocking and caps rage felt wrong to me, but it always does.  Like katsuki when he does it, I always think he's scum until he stops and posts in his more normal way.  I know that I suspect posts like that though.  But I thought that his explanations for stuff felt fine.  I'm also sappy and he's appealed to me several times and asked me to power town with him and it makes me want to hug him and town read him.  I also think he approached frogger a little weird if he's actually scum.  I'm not sure if that makes sense, but if they're site bff's I'd expect some crafting to his game to fit around frogger because he'd be his biggest obstacle here.

Oh he does seem legitimately bothered here and there that people aren't listening to his reads and with the exception of boon skies that didn't feel fake.  I don't think.  Maybe.",71697,2017-05-09 03:09:00,2302

5558,Nachomamma8,"
This is a good observation; Ali still seemed pretty confident that Frog was scum even after he was up to something, but you're right that he dialed back and that lines up with the I KNEW IT! post he made after Frog revealed the gambit.


Which is something I noted the last time I played with Alisae which I think is probably why I'm not super concerned when he gets a little overzealous in his pushes (and maybe seeing it so recently makes it stand out that much more in my mind), but I definitely agree that he lets his emotions lead him as town and I don't think it shows in the same way when he's scum. And here I don't think it matter whether there's momentum with the Frogger push or not, I think that he did put a lot behind that Boonskiies push and I think he put a lot behind the Frogger push and I think the fact that he formed two strong pushes like that so quickly is pretty strong evidence towards him being town.

The case you're making here seems to be that he tends to follow his emotions and that's something he couldn't/wouldn't fake as scum, I agree with you, that's the main thrust of the argument that I'm making here - that it's more likely that he's just drawn to certain pushes and got overzealous about it than him being scum where he's willing to fake multiple pushes in the way that he has here instantly and for no reason at all.",71697,2017-05-09 03:20:00,2304

Not sure what you're talking about here - just because he occasionally doesn't think things through doesn't mean that he will make an obvious mistake if scum because of lack of planning.

Well on keyser you say that it looks like he's in confirmation bias and scum wouldn't want to do that because it wouldn't be a good look, but some scum do tunnel on town players to look like they're convinced and have a hard time changing their reads.  Static reads with no change whatsoever is often a product of scum.

On fire bringer you're giving an easy contribution equals alignment in which you say he's not doing much, but if you read what he's actually said and the reads he's actually given they've been pretty good.

Your scum read on prism is due to putting a vote on someone when he knew he'd have limited access, which isn't a scum tell in the slightest.  

Most of your scum reads or questioning reads boil down to lack of contribution without looking at the actual contribution given, which is pretty superficial reasoning.

So the reasoning looks weak, but you don't have a lot of experience so some of this can be a product of a lack of experience with teasing out the intricacies of what contribution is present and what makes someone town/scum.  Or it can be scum who is scum reading people for easy reasoning.

ISOing is really useful for certain things, but sometimes it can be really harmful to do that and deprive the person of context. Granted, you can click on certain posts and look at the posts around it, but without the natural flow of the game, I feel like it still degrades the reads. Might be that I'm just too much of a perfectionist though (which I am), so it kills me not to absorb all info and consider every angle. But maybe that's good practive for me to become better at relinquishing control and taking things less seriously.

I was thinking something along the lines of putting faith in my stronger townreads and trusting their judgment. The thing I dislike about that is just because I townread somebody doesn't mean they are town or correct. I've always been naturally more inclined to lead than follow, but after my personal revelation, I wonder if it might not be a good idea to take the backseat more often. Or to find a way to strike a balance between the two.

By the way, that revelation was in the recently finished game with implosion and Titus, for those interested. This is the specific post where I had my epiphany, though there was a fair amount of buildup to it.",71697,2017-05-09 05:36:00,2359

Isoing does deprive context and makes it suboptimal.

Just following town reads also *can* be suboptimal because yes just because they're town doesn't mean they're right.

They're definitely imperfect solutions to trying to catchup in a game moving faster than you can dedicate to every post, but for day one at least it can be a stop-gap measure.

What's the scum motivation for acting that way in response to the titus reaction test? SAD's push feels to me like a tunnel that isn't looking at both sides of the coin.

Yeah, that's what I feel like I've been doing so far and what my general strategy is. I just worry that it isn't helpful because people can't get a read on me, I can't get a full read on everyone else, and I can't help people get a read on everyone else. But this might go back to my own arrogance and need for control. I feel like what I have to add to games is so valuable that I must get it out there as quickly as possible, otherwise people could make bad choices without my input or I could die and my input would be forever lost. 

But that's part of me that I dislike so much and made me come to that realization, so I have the knee jerk reaction of wanting to discard that attitude. At the same time, it's so ingrained into me that it feels wrong to just get rid of that part of me. And I worry that by overcompensating, I'll still be a bigger detriment than I would've been if I just stayed the way I am. On one hand, winning is fun and I feel like people enjoy winning. On the other hand, I feel like I can suck the fun out of a game and that's not something I ever find acceptable, regardless of my alignment. I don't personally believe in fun at the undue expense of others (i.e. emotional manipulation, inducing anger, attempts to hurt feelings, etc.)


And suboptimal play is what I typically try to avoid in pretty much every type of game I play. But sometimes maybe sometimes suboptimal play is the most optimal play under the right (or, more aptly, wrong) conditions. I suppose time constraints, lack of experience, lack of information, and things of that nature can make it so that your best bet is not to make the best move.

Disclaimer: As I've said with a couple of my previous posts where I've attempted to give you guys a transparent view of my thought process, please don't loo st this as alignment indicative. I have no desire to appeal to anyone's emotions or create a specific image of me. This is just self-disclosure that I feel is necessary. 

My intent is helping you guys understand me better as a player, both in this game and in future games, as well as to discuss these sorts of things so I can grow as a player and be of greater use. I simply discuss them in-game, rather than elsewhere because I feel they are intrinsically tied to the events of this game and as such, should not be discussed elsewhere. On top of that, I feel there is inherent game value in being able to understand the mind of your fellow players.

That said, feel free to believe or disbelieve anything I've said here if you think it is for the purposes of manipulating you. It's something we can discuss later. I won't make some sort of claim here on my honor as a player or a person. I recall once having to be force-replaced (nearly modkilled) for something similar once back when I used to play here and I'd rather not risk it now.",71697,2017-05-09 06:15:00,2369

5629,Hikari Link,"Okay, what I'm going to try to do in the next couple days then is respond to anything that was directed to me in the past 40 pages, see where my townreads stand on things, try to stay at least semi-engaged, look at Keyser's meta that I asked for previously and never got around too, and analyze the current wagons.

@implosion: Definitely don't let that part of yourself control your read. I fully believe that you should never trust me fully. This benefits me as both roles. As town, by telling people not to fully trust me, I'm less likely to be night killed. As scum, I'm less likely to be lynched (and seemingly counter-intuitively, I feel I'm generally less likely to be investigated with PRs). There're other facts at play too, but suffice it to say, it's fairly win-win for me.

And I'll tell you right now that integrity is my meta. Feel free not to believe my self-meta, though if you look at my old games, I would always espouse my self-meta truthly. That's because my primary meta goal used to be consistency in behavior regardless of my role. Consistency through quality work and truthfulness is still important to me, but the most important thing to me is respect towards other players and playing the game with integrity. I used to be a real piece of shit to deal with because I was extremely arrogant, overly opinionated, and at times abusive (and I still can be all of those things at times, despite my best efforts). But I want to grow as a person and a player, so if anybody isn't having fun because I'm being disrespectful or doing something that lacks integrity, then I am failing as both.

I think the votes/reasons/wagon on Titus can be categorised as bad, emotionally-charged and non-alignment indicative. I feel like there was scum presence on it so I will definitely be picking it apart today. 

Spoiler:  
I have only tried to express factors I personally think are alignment indicative factors and present scum-cases / town-cases.
I will do this until I die.
I have tried to be as clear as possible from the start of D1.
If I have a change of read I will express that in clear terms too.

I.e if I suddenly start doubting Titus is town, I will present a clear argument for why Titus is not town for x, y and z reasons.
If Titus is a null read, I will not talk about Titus, but will sort them in my own way.

So far, no one has convinced me of scum in my town-reads. Neither have I convinced myself of town in my scum-reads.

Read my ISO for those. I've already gone through the shameful/unsupported votes on her wagon, AND explained why she appears so disagreeable to people's expectations.

Have people actually voted/scum-read her for alignment indicative reasons? 
Why do you think Titus has been so unwilling to play along with your little game?
Do you think Titus has a rational reason to not play ball with the meta drivel being put before her nose?
Look at all these fucking opportunistic votes jumping from one bad wagon to the next.

The latest votes on her were just as shite as the first set too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This playerlist has been impossible to play with, the early meta ""circle jerk"", constant meta-shite being passed around, the discrediting, shitposting and undermining is disgusting. 
Guess what f**kers, you just got pocketed by scum. Start to look at what's actually scummy in isolation, instead of being blinded by confirmation bias and limited meta.

I have no faith in you lynching scum today. Perhaps my town flip will help you re-align your reads. I was considering replacing out much earlier, but nancy said play on. But it looks like D1 is over. If my reads, voice and cases have no worth, then I probably shouldn't be involved in this game anymore.

I'm a VT. So no harm in lynching me. Plus, no PR-exposed.

With 13 alive it takes 7 to lynch.
Day 1 deadline got fucking hammered.
FLAVORMini puts her phone aside for a moment to stare up at the ceiling, trying intently to calm her fidgeting. She's been lying on her bed for over an hour with the pillows gathered around her, spamming nancy's phone with messages and never receiving enough in reply. The incense on her dresser has died, but she hasn't noticed. She's too wrapped up in her impatience, waiting for nancy to arrive while warding off the swells of pain coursing up her back through to her forehead.

The distance between their houses is easily walkable, but the amount of time it takes to travel when there is nothing else to focus on drives Mini to rearranging the bed in every manner possible. After tossing the triangular pillow back against the head of the bed once again, she switches to Skyscanner app at a whim and checks for flights to Sweden. A moment later she flurries through a jumble of texts to nancy, only the first coming through with proper diction: nancy there are flights on sale to GÃ¶teborg!

~

In the brief surge of excitement at reading the message, nancy stops watching the path for just long enough to collide with a woman hurrying out of a store bearing a carrybag full of groceries in the crook of her elbow. The force of the impact sends the bag swinging and its contents half-spill out onto the stone paving: several tomatoes, a punnet of strawberries, an orange, and a jar of pickles. The jar shatters and spews pickle and preservative across nancy's textile shoes.",71697,2017-05-09 17:20:00,2500

The soft glow that filters through the clouds embarks upon its slow journey of clearing the dampness of the city streets. On Via Pillicciai, nancy glances regretfully at the closed doors of Come una Volta as she passes the gelateria at a brisk walk. She now has a new route to Mini's house, detouring by Via Mazzini on account of Mini's evening snacking habits, nevermind her shoes being completely ruinedâ€”the smell of pickle drags itself around with her everywhere, a plague upon her and anyone else with a sensitive enough sense of smell to catch the odor. The streets are steadily filling and motorbikes have begun zipping by with increasing frequency. Here and there a little pool of water that has collected over the course of the night is dispersed across the pavement, and nancy more than once has to predict the movement of traffic to avoid being sprayed.

She finishes typing another messageâ€”an incoherent jumble of lovehearts and smileysâ€”and sends it to Mini. A ray of light burns through a window (she thinks for a moment that it is the sun) and she squints against it as she moves to retrieve her sunglasses from her bag. The sound of traffic becomes unbearable as a truck trundles by, running through a puddle and sending a slur of muck in nancy's direction. She dodges backwards instinctively at the sound of wheel hitting water, twisting her body away from the turbulence of brownish liquid in her periphery, and trips over a terrier squatting patiently by its leash. For a moment the ground seems to be surging unstoppably up towards her, before it falters and halts and she realizes that she has caught herself with one hand gripping the flat stone of the building, and is stumbling to regain her balance. She forgets that the dog exists as she recovers shiveringly from the panic of the near-fall, starts once again down the street at a stilted gait, and stares without recognition at the pair of blue sunglasses in her hand, frame and lens crumpled and cracked from their meeting with the wall.",71697,2017-05-11 17:18:00,2502

I'm confused about that kill as he was ending up in my Poe, but I'm glad my original read there and evaluation of our interaction was right.  Anyway, I wish there was more than one person in the neighborhood so we could know whether or not he claimed there.  I guess he could have just been someone who was a middling town lean for most people but unlikely to be healed.

Or he jailed he nightkill and a vig/so shot him?

I dunno.

I'm still suspicious about titus.  There were a couple posts where I wondered if I was wrong, in particular one personal type attack that o wonder would be too low for her to go as scum.

What I didn't like was that titus hadn't said word one about keyser until frogger started suspecting him and I wondered if keyser could be scum whiteknighting a town titus.  Then titus started feeding into that a bit.  That hammer was absolutely atrocious.  Titus bitches when people hammer while she's away; she claims it's the thread not respecting her.  So days before deadline and before her suspects can do what they said they were going to do that very day, she hammers right after the claim?

I suspect this will be read as a scum replaceout, coming right after the night rather than before. I assure you that this is not the case despite its lack of fairness for my replacement.

Why claim here at all when you wouldn't be able to deduce who blocked you at all? Since the scum have a blocker, they know this, thus you're not going to get a pile on for scum. All it does is say Fire's a PR...",71697,2017-05-11 23:36:00,2563
5818,Prism,"This next paragraph was made before he posted his latest readlist. I don't know what to think about the Fire placement but the rest seems like what I would expect, particularly with regards to me.

I'm skeptical of Nacho's votes but simply the fact that Tammy says so makes Nacho extremely likely to be town. Nacho has made an incredible effort to try and get over that obstacle, and it's possible he has. This is the reason I trust Nacho's read on Tammy 100% but not Tammy's 100% on Nacho. Regardless this is objectively very unlikely to happen in this game. The fact that Tammy is alive today reinforces that she is correct here, in the sense that Nacho fooling her two days in a row is unlikely in his mind and he knows it.

Next part is just for him.

Spoiler: To Big Cho I've typed and backspaced and typed up this thing for you like 500 times with all sorts of weird shit so I'll just be blunt and hit send. First, before I get to the rest, thanks for inviting me to the game. We both know I don't want to replace out and I'm sorry I can't followthrough on this with you.

Second, assuming you're town, I typed up a bunch of shit about how you should focus on my replacement but ""Oh, here's this weird smoke signal bullshit that I always do if you need help, in the form of an emergency button"". You don't need help, just don't focus so much on me as much as my replacement.

I can't resist selfcommentating so reason I say that is that my playstyle, as far as how I've approached playing is purposely closer to my scumgame, in the sense that there are a lot of fundamentally positive traits I more easily display as scum but quickly run out of as town (Eagerness to cooperate, patience, not jumping to sarcasm/looking down on the other players) and this game was a conscious attempt to fix that disparity. My chance to engage earlier was an attempt to make up for the fact that this was practically guaranteed to get you to scumread me as a result of the meta shift.",71697,2017-05-11 23:36:00,2564

Let's say he did learn who the JK was jailing. If Gin didn't like the target, Gin could kill the JK. If the JK was targetting town and scum!Gin was okay with it, they could leave the JK to their own devices. Also, Implosion could easily lie about who he was going to JK, but that's kinda early to be making plays like that because Implosion doesn't get much information about it.",71697,2017-05-11 23:43:00,2576

@People scumreading Titus: Incentive she has to go all out vs. Nacho/Tammy like that yesterday is close to 0. She knew she was digging her own grave and some of the lines ""I kind of just want to prove Nacho is scum so that Tammy..."" reads pretty legitimately.

@Nacho: This isn't going to be something that helps my slot whatsoever but maybe it'll turn out to be a utilitarian good statement. I'm the one hard defending Titus and you have us as scum together. This is a pretty weird path I'm taking as scum. It makes more sense that at least one of your reads on us is wrong, if not both, and if it's me then it's worth rereading Titus to see if I'm chainsawing her.

Thanks to everyone for playing with me and for putting up with so much. I'm again sorry that I'm forced to replace out like this, and I hope to be able to play again soon. I enjoyed the time we had and felt I was making progress in my play, even if I wasn't playing well.

Especially thanks to nancy for reaching out to me to play, to replace in, and finally for listening to my request to give me another hour in the game before actually replacing me so I can get my final notes down. I really appreciate it.

I reread him over night along with the lurkerier people of Prism/Hikari/implosion.

I felt I was being slightly unjust in my attack of him because there are glimpses of him putting effort into the game. I didn't like him calling me town right after I started attacking him because it felt like it was trying to appease me (especially when he had a vote on boon) but I got good gut vibes from his reaction to his wagon in 2305 and his response to me in 2348.

Implosion I felt had a garbage hop on the Keyser wagon that looked opportunistic but what's happened happened.

Hikari still felt ~genuine~ and the lost/confusion felt more coming from a mindset of trying to scumhunt but being obstructed as opposed to her using it as a tool to hide behind.

Prism is just a huge question mark. Most of it is the playstyle I hate where it's super robotic so I can't tell what feels contrived/pushing a specific agenda, but nothing they have done gives me ~town gut vibes~.

THE REASON TITUS LOL HAMMERED IS CUZ SHE KNOWS I CAN CATCH SCUM D1 IN A JAM SESSION

She got lynched in Days of Yore Mafia because near the end of D1, Nacho and I were finally able to have a night to talk and we correctly called like 8/13 slots town and both scum as null and then the scum we caught, Titus!slot, barely escaped a lynch because of deadline. We then died and she was lynched D2.

BUT THE THING IS, SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT CAN DO. 

So she literally lol!hammered the night I was going to do a jam session, btw you should note this was with 7 days left to deadline so there was NO FUCKING RUSH, and I explicitly told people all the time that it was my free day to actually put work into here and lynching someone was a scum claim and they would have my vote till they die.

6076,Hikari Link,"
You have to have substantive interaction with people to call an argument T v T? I saw what looked like a pretty genuine fight between two people. 

On one hand, Boonskiies was misrepresenting the hell out of Fire and asserting repeatedly that he was town and Fire was scum, both of which are actions I tend to think are pretty scummy. But the venom was so real there that I could believe it coming from town. 

On the other hand, Firebringer seemed truly offended that Boon would imply that rb would ever replace out for impure reasons and absolutely refused to take his vote off Boon as long as Boon remained in the game, even though he acknowledged Boon was probably town. Parking your vote permanently on somebody for non-game reasons is anti-town as hell. But it's such a blatant move, that it's entirely conceivable (and probable) that it came from angry town.

Of the two, Boon looked worse, since he was the one turning a clearly non-alignment fight into something about alignment. Made me worry that he might have been scum faking his anger to push a lynch, look like angry town, or throw Firebringer off balance. But after looking at the Happenings on the first page after the lynch, I saw that Boon was actually force-replaced. After so many warnings for his conduct, I feel like if he was scum faking it, he would've just reigned it in and stopped poking at it. It's only through true anger that I could see Boon losing his cool so thoroughly. And I don't see why he would be that angry as scum.",71697,2017-05-12 04:42:00,2822

A good example is her scumread on implosion, it showed a lot of initiative to keep pushing on that line when everyone else was focused on other things. She didn't state it explicitly, but I could tell it bothered her that no one was playing attention, and that also felt very town to me. What do you guys think?

People who townread fire: I don't see where you're getting a townread on him. I don't really think it's in firebringer's personality to care that much how people perceive him as either alignment. I also definitely don't think at least what I've seen so far of him is not fakeable. What's up?",71697,2017-05-13 10:03:00,2905

Her scumread on implosion was so bad though. And even when people pointed out how bad it was and what was wrong with it, I believe she still kept pushing it. I don't know where you are in your read through, but I feel like she stayed pretty hard on him for a really long time with no evidence. Plus, I don't know about anything past what I've read, but based on what I've responded to so far, she misrepresents me on a regular basis. That doesn't strike me as particularly town.

Now that you mention her implosion push though, a thought occurs to me. It's possible that she picked up on some sort of breadcrumb or implication that he was the Jailkeeper and she tunneled so hard in hopes of getting him to claim and either confirm or deny her suspicions.",71697,2017-05-13 10:28:00,2906

So you disagree with my townread of them, but can't be bothered to read my case for why they read town because it's too long? Why would you not want to see a differing opinion on your scumreads to see if you missed something? 

You say how good my catchup attitude was compared to Ari, but was it really? I mean, I put in a lot of effort, sure, but Keyser and  Ari (who caught up in similar ways) were able to get active in the game more quickly. 

And I also don't like your comments about Nacho potentially buddying me, even though it feels more like you were the one trying to buddy me. I mean, you've got me in the same town tier as Tammy. That just seems absurd to me. I was in a vulnerable position, since I was receiving a lot of heat at the time, so I really feel like you picked an easy target to get a grateful townread out of me.

I won't discuss ongoing games or my reasoning for joining more either, but this game, specifically, is the most active game I've ever been in. By a large margin. Keeping up with it using my old strategy of thoroughly reading every page is equivalent to a full-time job. That's why I've realized that's not feasible or realistic anymore for this game. Nonetheless, I can see why me joining other games could be suspicious to you. Rest assured though, I'd never pretend to threaten to replace out of a game in order to get leeway for lurking or falling behind. I understand if anyone can't believe this, but I value creating a meta of integrity. Tainting that integrity for the sake of having a slightly better chance of winning single game, seems shortsighted.

Which is rather strange for Desperado as the two most recent games with him he was very opinionated and pompous).

TALK TO ME",71697,2017-05-13 21:16:00,2969
6224,Ser Arthur Dayne,"
Continue to catch up! I'm actually really liking your posts even though I don't necessarily agree with some of the reads. I know you wanted me to explain my hikari and firebringer townreads and I can go deeper on that when I get the chance, but the gist of it is that hikari's posts are extremely genuine and feels like a newbie who is lost and trying to get the feel for the game. When he inned for the game and talked to nacho I think I saw that he hasn't played a game since like 2011 and it gave me the vibe of ""why are games so much spammier now"" level of annoyance which rang genuine because he showed points of trying scumhunt, and whenever he does catch up or write posts they have the insight of someone doing what they can with what they read to form reads (p similar to what you're doing except he felt was fleshing out his reads more and just reads the game slower which isn't an insult or jab at him just some people like to gauge the game at different paces). For Firebringer this one has a lot more to do with meta but his play was very similar to laundry mafia where he does troll but also has bright points of attempted scumhunting as well as emotional investment in the game. Scum him from my experience, like in defcon, he is similarly trollish but that's all he kinda does, he doesn't have the same level of emotion in the game. When he says things about how he's feeling or shows drive and motivation it's usually a p good sign that it's town him. Scum him is just a caricature of his town game.",71697,2017-05-13 21:19:00,2970
6225,Ser Arthur Dayne,"LOL my dude my phone typing is incredibly slow.

As for Ari disengagement is one of the things I do look out for in scum. It's not by any means ~strong~ especially by itself, but combined with a lack of drive to solve the game is a decent tell. Like have you seen my scum game? It's literally a blobfish because I hate it and have 0 interest in putting in the effort to fake anything. Which is what Ari is doing. He's here at times to joke and have fun but I don't feel there's a drive to gamesolve.",71697,2017-05-13 21:24:00,2971

Maybe when I catch up I'll see what you're saying with hikari, right now I don't. He seems to be questioning things to question things and I don't see much of an attempt to form reads, but instead him saying he's attempting to form reads.

You might be right on firebringer though. The last time I saw town!fb he was very different and a lot more involved. But what I remember of his meta before that matches what you said there. Scum!him just trolled while town!him did a small amount of scumhunting.

PEdit: sorry.

Ari is almost always disengaged from games he plays in unfortunately. He's a known lurker. With town him there are spots of genuine scumhunting you can find, which I think tammy has done, but with scum!him there is just nothing there.",71697,2017-05-13 21:30:00,2972

I don't usually forget town!titus posts, if anything they're kind of like gin's this game where she has a plan to catch scum that's not all explicit but you can tell it's there. Scum!titus can appear towny at times but overall there's just a lot less to it. I think it may be a motivation thing.

Ohh off memory this is one of the things (well similar but a little before those events) I disliked about Titus and I tried to interact with her about. Her lynch pool was basically the people on her wagon and when I asked her who she thought was voting her genuinely and who was voting her opportunistically/scummy she basically shrugged me off and said she can't do wagon analysis pre-flips even though that wasn't even what I was asking of her.

I am also noticing Ari's catchups but I kinda wanna let him do his thing and then look at it on a whole. The thing is I just don't know how much Ari can fake. He's a fairly competent player from what I've seen, but I think I ~maybe~ am finally seeing what Nacho meant when he said this is beyond Ari's scum range, esp like the scumreading a lynched person part.",71697,2017-05-14 02:53:00,3048

In fact the killer of implosion has already confessed!
Why isn't he on the stand?

Ohh right, we agreed vigilantes are good.

And if we agree vigilantes are good we should agree vigilante groups are good.
And if Titus is a member of a vigilante group, as all evidence points to, then we obviously cannot condemn her.

What case does the prosecution have?
That she secretly wants you all dead?

It's a gross oversimplification to say that I townread pro-town and scumread lurkers/anti-town players. The players I scumread have tended to be anti-town, while the townreads tended to be pro-town, but that's clearly not the extent of my reasoning.

I don't think the reasons for my Frog/Ali analysis were simplistic or weak. I closely analyzed the two of them and came to the conclusion that based on their interactions, it was very unlikely they were scum. The lengthy analysis was necessary to fully articulate what I was seeing.

I said that Fire could be scum coasting. On the whole, he leaned more scum than town.

I don't think Ali or Keyser were particularly pro-town and implosion was primarily a lurker. There's really not even any reasonable way I can respond to this. Yeah, that's how my reads ended up. What of it though? Like, how is that a relevant observation?

Then I guess I did a good job of making the tl;dr then, didn't I? The whole point was to summarize it for those who don't care for reading long posts (some people flat out refuse to read walls). The long version was me pointing out examples of what lead me to believe certain things about both players, in hopes that other people who read it might come to similar conclusions. As for my confidence, it's certainly not ironclad (I've been wrong before and I could be wrong again), but this is a game of intuition. And my intuition told me that it would have been hard for either to trick each other and everybody else.

Regarding Fire, his vibe was that of scum to me. Again, it's not that it was a hard scum read and his play was more anti-town than scummy, but the combination of traits certainly pointed to it as a possibility. What is your contention here? That it's unnatural to look at his activity and think that he could be scum?

Townblock is basically a grouping of town who townread each other and work as a unit. Right now Tammy, Nacho, Gin, Infinity, SAD, and myself, with Desperado as a strong maybe, are all fairly certain we are town together.

What do you think of this group? Do you have any reservations about any of the members? Do you think that we are a strong, cohesive, Town unit that can be trusted? Do you think we are foolish for assuming we can read each other well enough to do this?

6421,Kelvin Smith,"Spoiler: Regarding Townblock 
Nah, you don't. It's not totally unreasonable to expect me to read the game when so many other people seem to be able to.

As for the townblock, I think that trust and cohesion are an important part of getting things done. But in a game build around deception, that trust needs to be tempered with skepticism. Titus wrote a good article about this sort of idea (which is another reason I think she's scum) and I very much agreed that town cohesion is a very good thing. I feel fairly good about most of the group.

I've liked Gin for a long time now and nothing I've seen from him so far has led me to believe he isn't town. I believe he's going to be an important player for getting things done.

My interactions with Tammy and her interactions with Titus that I have seen make me feel very good about her as town. So far, I feel she has shown good judgment and I feel that she's a good core for the town.

I may have missed a lot from Nacho during the end of Day 1, because I don't recall seeing much from him after a certain point, but I defer to Tammy's judgment regarding him as town. What I have seen from him, he's a good mediator and I think that he will prove valuable in keeping the townblock from getting into petty squabbles. If misunderstandings arise, I expect he can fix them.

Infinity has mostly been focused on me, so I can't really speak to his judgment, since I really don't see any degree of validity to the points he's made. I still need to interact with him more on his case against me though to see if I think his tunneling on me is confirmation bias at play or if it feels like scum motivation. I felt good about Frog, so I'm inclined to believe the former. Especially since, like Keyser, he got his read early on in the read through and has stuck with it the whole time.

SAD gives me the feeling that I'm being buddied. Like, I'm in pretty much every scum pool and this guy has me ranked as his #2 town? I fucking know I'm town and even I think that's a stretch. Tammy similarly pointed out reasons that she thought I was town or why cases against me were bad, but she tempered it with expectations of content and her own suspicions (which are fair, given my shit play thus far). I felt that Boon was town, but my biggest reason for that was that he was force-replaced, which I generally don't think would happen to scum faking anger. But SAD's absolute defense of me rubs me the wrong way. As I've said in the past though, I'm very sensitive to someone trying to buddy me due to my past with Nacho, so that may just be an overreaction on my part.

People trust Desperado? Why? Did I miss something? I thought everyone thought Ali was scum, so that's surprising. I'm not sure about his judgment at all, so I don't know if he adds any value to the townblock.

I'm not too sure about your judgment, since I think most of your activity has been during parts I haven't read. But people I like tend to townread you and when I'm behind, the best I can really do is sheep them until I get a better picture of you myself.",71697,2017-05-14 06:08:00,3167

I'm open to being wrong on you I've made that very clear, but you've not shown me that and it has nothing to do with your bad read on Nacho.  You can keep calling him scum when he isn't, but that's not going to make him scum.

You can also discredit my read all you want and you can say he's just coasting, but there are several people in this game who've seen me doubt and scum read a nacho that was barely present and not doing the things he should be doing.

It's a coincidence that I read pro-town players as town and anti-town players as scum? Or are you saying that my reads are too accurate so far and that it implies that I'm scum working from a place of knowledge?

I literally don't know what you are talking about. What I wrote their was absolutely instrumental in the development of the final read. They were examples of things that severely contradicted the possibility of any conclusion other than the one that I ended up coming to. I'm not sure how to explain it better.

Again, I'm not sure how it's not making sense to you, but I'll try to explain. What's in the spoiler are the foundations of the vibe.

And for those of you not caught up.

Yesterday's lynch was on Keyser, a lynch that I thought was fine but was on my second scum read as you can tell in the above vote count, my vote was still on Titus.

Titus is claiming that I pushed through a lynch on someone in her town block, yet she never town read Keyser and in fact when I posited that keyser was scum white knighting a town titus and frogger was noticing the same weirdness she started maneuvering about how yeah that looked possible.

Keyser then claimed VT, and immediately after the claim, one week before deadline, before anybody could react to the claim post, Titus hammered.

I don't understand what you are trying to say here. I really don't. My reasons for sorting them were not solely because they were pro-town or anti-town. They generally were those things, but there was more there than just doing something pro-town. Certain people had meta tells from others that solidified my reads, others had thought processes that were hard to fake as scum, and some just acted in a way that only really made sense to me from a town-minded viewpoint.

Yes, please do that. I'll try my best. Based on my experience with several personality assessments, I've come to understand that I tend to make connections that feel intuitively correct to me, but that can be difficult to translate to others. It's possible that that's the issue here.

I guess the best way to explain it is that I wouldn't expect disengaged town to post as much or be as interactive and chipper. It wasn't the feel of somebody who didn't want to be here, it was the feel of somebody who actively wanted to get by. Does that make sense to you?",71697,2017-05-14 06:43:00,3184

6442,Kelvin Smith,"
Being pro-town and anti-town aren't inherently towny or scummy to me. It's about taking in the whole picture though. There's certainly context you have to consider and when certain pro- or anti-town activities are considered together or with various tells. If somebody is super pro-town, they are acting in a clear and consistent manner, and their logic is sound, those things bolster a townread. If that same person was anti-town, I might still townread them, but it might be a weaker townread. Or hell, I might townread them more, if paranoia creeps in. At the end of the day, it's all about how I interpret everything in front of me and how that makes me feel about the player. I don't know of any other way to play the game.

Sorry, it seemed implicit to me. Like I said, stuff just makes sense in my head and seems obvious to me, but when I communicate it to others, sometimes things get lost in the exchnge. I endeavor to be as clear as I can be, but it can be hard for me to tell what needs to be said and what needs to remain unsaid. That's why I usually use way more words than I probably need to.

Spoiler:  
Uhh, yeah? It was really better.
It's not about how much you get done or how many words you post or what your reads end up being. If I notice glimpses on genuinity and scumhunting that feels like it's actually trying to solve the game as opposed to just dumping things to try and look good I get very good vibes. Both Keyser's and Ari's catchups (the latter at the time not the recent ones) looked like they lacked any scumhunting and looked like they were fake and more interested in commenting on things for the sake of looking like they were ~catching up~. I don't really care how much you catch up on, like I said before someone can read 5 pages and form reads from them that'd make me feel good about them (see Infinity's catch ups).

Spoiler:  
Maybe it's the soft spot in my heart but I get good gut vibes from people that are confused but show good attempt at trying to figure things, it's something that is underappreciated in all the spam and back and forths, the people who are putting in effort but feel alienated at the same time. I don't really care much if you think it's buddying you as I am more in stating the reads I have. I know that may sound hypocritical because I thought Nacho could've been buddying, but meh.

Spoiler:  
I thought both the votes before me and after me of implosion and Titus were bad and riding on the wagon to push it through. Titus I have a lot more experience with though so it'd be better to see what she said and what she did so I decided to go with implosion (who I actually thought was bussing at the time but his vote also looked extremely opportunistic, and when I looked over night at the lurkers to try and sort them out he came out by far looking the worst).

6601,Leonshade,"Won't start catching up until tomorrow, but I'll list my impressions based on the following along for the first 50 pages or so, before I replaced in.

Town: Nacho, Fro99er

Nacho started the game off by scumhunting and providing loads of good content, a strong early TR. My read is bit influenced by the fact that scum!Nacho in the last game we played together was mostly the opposite of what he's been like here, mostly coasting and giving excuses for doing so. Scum!Nacho in that game did provide good content under pressure, but here he does it right off the bat, and it feels more genuine.

I scumread Frogger during his early game (I thought he was going for ""too scummy to be scum"" WIFOM with his continued silence treatment), but the huge post where he explained his gambit and reads (yes, I read it despite not being in the game) was really towny, as was his play afterwards.

I also had implosion as town for his early game.

Scummy: Alisae (Desperado), Gin

Ali is a toneread, some of his posts felt like he was trying to force his town tone. 

Gin was also a scumlean, though I don't remember the exact reason why. I just remember thinking that his play resembled his play in Civ Mafia than Spyro.

That's less reads than I remember having. Maybe it's just because implosion died. I also thought that it was odd that I didn't townread Tammy, since she was so obvtown in our last game together. But she seemed to have other stuff going on in the early game, so I'm not reading too much into that, yet.",71697,2017-05-15 18:57:00,3347

It's the same thing as yesterday when I tried to work with her where she was ignoring the wagon and here she doesn't really feel like she's responding to the wagon or the points people are bringing against her but rather staying in this vacuum of static reads. I'm not at the same point as Tammy on Nacho but I know he's super busy right now and hopefully when he's back me and him can have a nice chat where I feel ~super confident~ on him.

I don't wanna jinx the Leon catch up (or if Desperado ever plans on starting to dig in..) but I do think Titus might fit into the Leon/Desperado/Titus triangle scumteam p nicely and that Leon just said that for town points on the Desperado scumflip.

I certainly can't take all the credit for the case against you, but I firmly believe I laid the groundwork for the case against you.

Scum could be sitting bad, I agree. But it's not sustainable and we are going to get him if he continues. I'd rather gamble on him being town and seeing an NK go there (or not and worrying in page game about him) than I would like to gamble on a Lynch for laying low.

Depends on the context but it would be worth enquiring further. Was it day 1, day 5? Did the player take stances later on?

See, when you provide the context, this isn't a hedge. This is a weak townread. The author thinks that Almost claiming VT is more likely to be a town move that the author doesn't understand.

The only way that could be interpreted as a hard stance is interpreting that Nacho doesn't want to TR implosion, hence the shake off comment. That's contradictory to Nacho's entire tone this game thus invalid interpretation or scum anyway.

Because it feels like a mislynch scum are keeping on the sidelines because they know she won't really defend herself because of a combination of inexperience and confusion from this game. Also it feels like the way she plays is a replica of the ""past"", the old style heavy analysis low ~emotional~ play, which is more easily pushed because someone won't be screaming against their lynch and easier to ignore the walls and logical posts. 

What really bothered me is how easily Titus got on the wagon. She has ignored Hikari for like ever which feels like a mislynch she's keeping on the sidelines ready to pull whenever, which she's now sheeping you on.

Early game I got the town vibes from Hikari because it reminded me a lot of my early ways of playing where I used to do a bunch of shit and people used to ignore me and push me as an easy mislynch.

Is that really an accurate summation of what the site meta is like now?


No worries. Also, you could just call me Kelvin. Might help you remember that I'm a guy.

Spoiler: 3495 
No you haven't. ISO me and tell me and look at all of the posts I've directed at you or written about you. Now ISO yourself and see how many times you've engaged me since fucking voting me. You've quoted me maybe 3 times. And maybe one of those quotes could be classified as an interaction. You keep ducking people and acting like you're the most transparent player in the world.

And it's not like my reads have really gotten much of a chance to develop. I've had very few interactions and the flips we have so far aren't very revealing, so I've got so little to work with in terms of data. Since the day has started, the town has been focused almost entirely on you, and you've given me no reason to believe that that's a misguided endeavor. The general consensus has been ""let's wait for everybody to catch up, then lynch Titus,"" so I haven't felt like there is more that needs discussing at this time.


That's definitely been a factor. The negativity early on has killed some of the joy I derived from this game and also left me unmotivated. In addition, there's just something about this game that feels really off and I can't for the life of me figure out what it is. I believe I pretty much said that I'd probably have to spend a bit of time being a blatant sheep until I could get my wits about me. Now I need something to observe to be able to interact and solve things. I've got almost no data, because the Keyser mislynch was pretty much townreads, with a quickhammer by my top scumread. Even my top townread (Tammy) felt good about the Keyser wagon, so it's not inconceivable that it was a primarily town-driven wagon. The only Night Kill was by the Vig and we have no idea who implosion targeted, so that flip's pretty unhelpful too.",71697,2017-05-18 05:00:00,3510

Titus is still scum I think but this is my stronger scumread. Would like to hear nacho's reasons for having doubts. I think titus is just falling apart because everyone is against her. That's not necessarily a scum thing, but if she was town I think it would involve a lot more of either pushing really hard or just giving up and less blatant buddying to get anyone she possibly can on her side. I would expect her to double down on her one top scumread instead of switching from yelling nacho is scum to yelling gin is scum. And apparently she isn't even that confident on nacho--how is she not doubting herself here? 3214 in particular is weird with her insisting nacho is scum and I think it was an attempt to try to get me on her side.

To believe a claim you really should have a townread on a person before, and you side shading my slot (boonskiies) really doesn't make me feel like you naturally progressed through the read on me.

I would pressure a claimed cop/doctor/etc in a heartbeat if I had previously had a scumread on them. Not necessarily ~wagon~ them because yes those roles can be proven later, but I don't magically gain a townread off of a claim, which you seemed to have no problem doing.

Alright, well let me tell you about how we came about this product.

Several months ago, the founders of Desperado Wagon had one dream in mind.
They wanted a quality lynch at a good price. They saw the market and were disatisfied with all that was there to offer so they said ""We can do this better!"" so they got together and realized it was time to put up or shut up. So they worked tirelessly starting up their company. It was endless hours and grueling work days. They got their foot of the ground but they knew they had to set themselves apart from their competition. So they decided to put their own faith in their product and show everyone they are the true pioneers for scum lynches.

Now the product is made with a few special proprietary materials that I can't really disclose for legal reasons, but I can tell you the process is pretty intense. They first gathered together the most top quality posts, put them through a machine that they like to call ""tone analisizer"" after they got finished with that, they soon needed to add more. They went and gathered what a new formula called 'Meta 401Z' a blend of other games that was used to process a certain kind of chemical compound found in scum. With all that added it was time to add what we think of as the cherry on top, our secret ingredient. We call it ""Lurkscum"", many think its not a needed ingredient, but we think it just further compliments the product we are offering here at Desperado Wagon Inc.",71697,2017-05-20 00:56:00,3617

I am trying to work on it but I really dislike when the game slows down to a crawl because scum have sooo much easier time hiding in it as opposed to constant pressure/wagon building that leads to lynching. Keeps scum worried.

I didn't want to do a post-by-post catch-up because that would slow me down even more, but I'll go into more detail since everyone's being so anal. My Ari read is based on his discussion with Boonskies, and especially his discussion of his own scum meta (see 1414, 1415). I don't trust self-meta by itself, but from what I've heard of Ari's scum meta, as well as reading scumgames of his (like Micro 627), I know that he's not that confident or active as scum. I don't see scum!Ari talking about his own scum meta with such confidence, nor do I see this play coming from scum!Ari in general. I see Ari as similar to Creature in that he can easily obvtown if need be, because his scumgame isn't that good.

I'm contrasting Tammy's play in this game with her play in OotS. There, she was obvtown from the get-go. She hasn't struck me as obvtown here, which made me paranoid of that slot even before I replaced in, so I've been trying to keep that in mind when sorting her. I wasn't impressed with her early play, my impression was that she was doing a lot of interacting and little actual sorting, mostly just throwing out easy reads like Nacho being town. Between pages 50-60 she had some posts (1411, 1423) that displayed more of an original thought process, which is making me feel better about her play. I don't really have a reason to scumread her, besides the aforementioned paranoia, so he's a mild townlean for now.",71697,2017-05-21 16:23:00,3643

I never said that Boon was scum. I said that he was obnoxious and that his scumread wasn't convincing. I started skipping his posts after a while, knowing that you've claimed vig means that you'll be sorted in another way.



Your claim isn't a cop or a doc, it's a vig. That makes your claim much more easily proved than just about any other PR. There's no way you survive to the endgame if you're fakeclaiming scum, so chances are you're either a vig or an SK.

My questioning of Infinity's reasons was irrespective of a scumread on you. It's about finding the motivations of other players in the game. Some people's reasoning is clearer to me than others and doesn't require more information. His explanation was lacking, so I needed to force more out of him.

The explanation for my vote has been throughout all of my posts, if people would actually read the shit that I say.

Spoiler: Initial Scumread 

Spoiler: Why My Reads are Undeveloped 

Spoiler: Why I'm Sheeping My Townreads 

I had little choice but to settle on you. The Titus wagon died abruptly, so I follow the lead of my townreads and moved to somebody else in my lynch pool. I just want valuable flips and actionable information at this point. The game is in a fairly stagnant state at this point and I don't have the time, energy, or (apparently) ability to whip up a Titus wagon in time for the 4 day deadline. I felt all of those things were so apparent in my vote for you that they didn't even require an explanation, but apparently not. I'm not sure how much of that is me not being clear enough and how much of it is everybody else in the game seemingly ignoring almost everything I say.",71697,2017-05-21 17:47:00,3671

It means jackshit when there's 4/6 votes on him and your vote is off him. If he won't be lynched, it's because you refuse to put your vote on him.



The fuck? Gin's claim only holds true because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. He's literally the reason stopping his ""scumread"" from getting lynched. Taking him at face value is shallow, because his claim makes no sense, given his reads and the gamestate. Gin scumreads Desperado. Desperado is two votes away from lynch range.

Like you, I've been in a state of perpetual catchup, pretty much since the game started. Even if you are behind, is that not something you would have picked up on? Unfortunately, a big part of my posts this game has been me discussing how far behind I am or how much information I'm lacking. Why did you assume that I had no explanation for jumping on your wagon when you admit that you aren't caught up? Perhaps my explanation existed in past posts (which it did). You didn't ask for my explanation of the vote though, you threw shade on me for it. I'm an easy target right now (I'm in a lot of people's top scumreads), so what's a little more shade to drive a wagon on me? Even though you'd presumably know the plight of being behind, you ignored that and used your lack of information as a guise to attack me. Despite the accusations that have been leveled against me, I have been trying my damnedest to understand those who have reads on me (be they townreads or scumreads) and the gamestate in general.

Desperado replaced Alisae, who I felt pretty good about as town. But I didn't see his performance later in Day 1, so I don't know if there's anything there that would change my opinion. Desperado's input since replacing in has been minimal; I don't even know if he's caught up to the game or has plans to do so. I certainly don't like that, but between Titus, you, and the looming deadline, he has been someone I've put on the backburner.

As for Gin, I can't say that anything has changed. Your case on him is weak. Just because he's got you and Desperado in the same scum tier, doesn't mean there is anything wrong with him wanting to lynch you first. As I said before, he seems like a guy who tries to take control of the situation and steer the town in the direction he thinks is best. Nothing I've seen suggests that Desperado is going to get off the hook later just because he wants to lynch you right now and unless that becomes the case down the road, I don't really find it scummy to stick to his guns on lynching you.",71697,2017-05-21 19:29:00,3683

Back to null for you, there's no reason to believe your claim, now. 



My scumreads were Desperado, who flipped town, and Gin, who I was scumreading due to the associative with Desperado (and due to misreading his trolling). Your slot was also a weaker scumread, but your predecessor corrected me on my reason for scumreading him. I didn't read much during the night, so I haven't had time to develop new scumreads.

Like, for me, I wouldn't have minded if you claimed intent to hammer and gave me time to react.
Because then I could say ""hey, give me 12 hours to make a couple posts and if I don't deliver then go ahead and hammer"" or I could say ""okay I'm much less happy with a Desperado lynch over a Leonshade lynch; here's Tammy and I coming over to make that possible"".

Like I realize that deadline was three days out and that's a perfectly reasonable time period to get a lynch and honestly I don't care if we end up lynching within three days of deadline starting but if you don't let me respond to the imminent lynch then you're completely fucking me over and I specifically expect you not to do that when we're friends.",71697,2017-05-24 19:45:00,3846

So, SAD is my 2nd strongest townread after Tammy. Like, she's all but confirmed town IMO. Unless SAD is SK doing a no kill gambit (i thought he was SK going into the night) then he's reasonablyvery strong town. I trust his read on you.
Couple this with the gut feeling I've had most of the game on you and it amplifies. Then you push Bach onto Nacho like this rather and accuse him of being scum, when he made a reasonable point, and the fact that if Implo was protecting Nacho, As we assume he was, you likely failed to kill him N1.

7111,Nachomamma8,"
My main reason for thinking that Titus is town is because early on, she felt like her push on me was driving a wedge between her and Tammy and still she kept pushing. I contrasted this with her treatment of Nero in Rogue One; you correctly noted that she wasn't having fun in the game before because ""no one was listening to her"" but that was much different than her not having fun with the game because of Nero's treatment of her - no one listening to her is a problem that she has in general and is not caused by any one person or any one action and letting go of cases or pushes she feels are strong just so people would listen to her doesn't solve the underlying problem at all. This reason for thinking she's town is a very nebulous one, and not one that I have a whole lot of confidence in; I felt more strongly about it before you provided the Rogue One counterexample, but I don't feel great about it in general. I feel much better about lynching Camn and Leonshade.",71697,2017-05-24 20:03:00,3857
7112,Nachomamma8,"Camn, I still don't understand why you voted Desperado as quickly as you did - ""bloodlust"" is weak reasoning from where I'm standing because of how you ended up approaching the wagon in general - seems patently obvious that you weren't feeling great about it and Desperado is someone who I'd think would be eligible for at least a slight bropass and it's weird you'd be willing to go to night without much more than a general feeling about who is who (would have expected you to at least want to interact with a couple people so you could make sure we were headed down the right path) - could you talk about your thought process there after you replaced in?",71697,2017-05-24 20:07:00,3858

People really need to learn what ate is, and considering I was the one he ate'd at in laundry mafia and I'm not going oh he's ate'ing, no it's nothing similar.

You quick hammered a town read of his without letting him come in and finish catching up and without a claim and then you were a jerk to him in response when he called you out.

I explicitly said yesterday I was not voting because I did not want a lynch before Nacho had a chance to catch up.  What happens?  And you reamed Titus for doing what you just did the next day.

And this game is nothing like Laundry mafia, this game he's been crapped on by players here.  First RB tries to halt him doing anything early game by throwing the shit at him he did, Titus decides to call his efforts in this game useless when him giving his reads were anything but, and now you, a friend, deflect to him when he calls you out because he's frustrated at your anti-town behavior.

FLAVORPast the spotty yellow facades, the red clay walls and the ornate doors, under shuttered windows and the overhanging balconies with their sharp, black railing, by the display fronts and the little poles marking the way safe for pedestrians, nancy closes in on the intersection of Via Catullo and Mazzini. She mulls over all the variety of flavors of chocolate as she walks, in anticipation of reaching Venchi, and fails to notice her phone making a fuss in her coat pocket. As she reaches the intersection, she notices two women, dressed identically, in a heated discussion with a man by the corner. Their dispute abruptly descends into shouting, with the man braying that his rights and men's rights all over the world are being violating, that he is a victim of oppression in a culture ""dominated by female manipulation"". Tears begin rolling down his cheeks as the couple spit at his feet, turn heel and walk away. Ever a tourist of misandry and male tears, nancy savors the sight for a moment before moving on.

A customer comes barrelling out the store just as she does, carrying hot chocolate somewhere in an explicable rush. The woman suddenly trips and falls, and her drink goes flying. The liquid streams onto nancy's coat in a hot, dark mess.

With 8 alive it takes 5 to lynch.
Day 4 deadline got immensely self-hammered.
FLAVORA moment of remembrance abruptly falls upon nancy as she waits her turn in Venchi with the stain of chocolate drying into her coat. She is reading the news on her phone and happens upon a piece describing the death of a man in the UK who had apparently been a serial online stalker. She notices by the pictures that he looks eerily similar to the photos she was sent by that creep who followed her across the Internet last year.

It had taken removing herself from social media and removing every trace of herself from the public that was she was able to finally begin to feel safe from him. How many emails had he sent her begging for attention, promising himself to her? How many times had he stalked her from one site to the next, somehow always managing to know her movements, for months invading her private life and never giving her a moment of peace?

And now he has apparently been murdered by one of the women he was stalking on and off for over four years. It is a horrible crime, but her feelings upon discovering the articleâ€”seeing his picture and reading his name over to herself to dispel her doubtâ€”is sheer relief.

7482,nancy,"FLAVORThe first time Mini and I kissed was in Gothenburg, outside the airport. It wasn't at all romantic on reflection, but it was so new that it kind of felt that way at the time. I remember it being a cool dayâ€”it was springâ€”with the sun out and I remember her wearing a blue and white polkadot dress and that her hair was done up in an elaborate braid that had partially come apart at the seams over the course of the flight. I'd warned her not to nap but she fell asleep anyway. I don't think she could help it, really. When we landed and got off the plane we were both so damn happy to be in Sweden finally that the wait for our baggage was the scarcely bareable peak of a crescendo that would only find release in the outdoors. We were stuck in international limbo, breathing in the stale air of disinfectant and airconditioning, with the actual Sweden, the fresh, oceanic air, still waiting for us, just out beyond the glass exit doors.

And when we made it outside there wasn't much else to do, really. We led our bags off the way and ran a circle then we were in each others arms hugging and she kissed my lids and my cheek then she kissed my lips and I was so completely gone from the bliss of it that there's just no way for me to ever forget that soft and elusive feeling of connectedness that I've since developed an addiction for or the flight leading up to it or the way that she smelled of lilac and the way that the outside smelled of dew and pollen and hibiscus (although the hibiscus may have just been someone walking by with a bouquet).

The street turns into Piazza Bra and the arena, in full first-century splendor, overwhelms the scene. Cars and motorbikes busy the wide road and umbrellas tucked obediently into their sheaths decorate the sidewalk by the outdoor seating of restaurants and cafes. She turns quickly onto Piazzetta Rubiani then Via Cattaneo and is once more relatively alone on the late-morning sidestreet among the cracking paint of old walls and wire-hanging lamps. She sticks her hand into her coat pocket as the moves around a woman talking on her phone in a morning gown outside her door and feels the prick of an object she did not know was there.

She pulls the object out and realizes that it is the silver necklace with a half-moon pendant given to her by her first girlfriend all those years ago. nancy wonders for a moment whether her ex still has its twin, the other half of the moon, then lifts the lid of a garbage bin as she passes and drops the necklace inside.",71697,2017-05-30 01:58:00,4300

Why vote camn without pushing on Titus harder?
Your Titus read seemed very waffly through out the whole game iirc I asked about Titus on like day 1 or 2 and you said something along the lines of ""I have titus as a scumread but I don't wanna vote her"". I understand if you were trying to figure her out and were torn on her, but I don't really see the push or the drive to back that up. Neither during day 5 when she got lynched.

Omgomg who did I choose??? Am I right???? (yes)

Gin

Pros
- Early interaction with Rb doesn't really read scum on scum
- Liked the calming/moderation he did when Boonskies vs Fire was a thing
- Liked his long funny post about Titus. Most definitley wasn't needed to get a Titus lynch so looked like pushing wagon genuinely (+ his earlier interaction with Titus the big argument)
- Feels transparent a lot of at certain times
- Sunbro

Cons
- Dislike the claim and don't think it makes much sense
- Baiting Desperado hammer while on Leonshade
- Asking Leonshade to claim several times before he reached L-1 possibily because of lack of daytalk in scumchat
- Don't really like confirm town stuff he said about himself today or about implosion confirming him
- Sunbro (buddying??questionmark?!?)

Firebringer

Pros
- Liked argument with boonskiies got glimpses of town-firebringer there
- Liked calling out Alisae on gambit with conviction
- The ~sales pitch~ felt genuineish
- Like nach defending when I was having my paranoia (doesn't really read as buddying because he can just let me continue having that guess in back of mind?)

Cons
- Lack of scumhunting since Day 1
- Heavily pushing the Desperado wagon vs Leonshade
- Weird interaction with avoiding the Leonshade wagon next day
- Early awkward posting on Day 4 with gambit that looked like it tried to derail camn wagon
- Dislike Titus sideline read

Infinity (/frogger)

Pros
- Like interaction with Alisae that made frogger angry to replace out
- Like the super early infinity replacing in reaction to my vig testing
- Like infinity's replacing in and digging in and his catchup responses
- Him on Leonshade looks decently okay

Cons
- Dislike how hard he's fallen off + general lack of scumhunting
- Don't really like the townread on Titus then being okay with lynch (looked like early whiteknighting of a very likely wagon)
- Him being off of camn doesn't really sit right
- Dislike today's opening reads like scum who is not willing to put in effort/possibly gave up
- Reaction to Firebringer's willigness for him as scumread reads fake",71697,2017-06-02 03:10:00,4405

I'll say what I really liked about Infinity is his stream of consciousness style type posting that I didn't see in mystic mafia when he was scum.

If I'm wrong then I guess good for Infinity for putting on a good show of demotivation then picking himself back up? Idk scum would just continue playing the AtE card instead of switching into scumhunting mode imo (kinda what I feel Firebringer is doing :/)

Over id say the last half year to i don't know how long. I have lost the drive for mafia. Most of this due to my own inability to find improvements in my play which makes me feel unable to be taken seriously as a player, and being scumread and saved to be mislynched in every game i play.

I used to love being in the LYLO/MYLO, it was the most fun time for me! Scum called me the wild card of mylo, unable to see what I would od. Now I just hate it, because all that happens is, I missvote, or i get mislynched. Even when I vote right, i am mislynched.

I don't like playing mafia anymore because people who attempt to read me often fail and don't have a fundamental understanding of how i play. Which is part of my problem as a player, i am a hard to read player, mostly because my motivations and win condition aren't always aligned.

i am prone to going off the rails.

I often now struggle with just the thought of people scumreading me. I dislike that about me. I can't put the effort i want to in games because i am demotivated from starting.

I know exactly what to do if i wanted to convince people and be charismatic, but my heart just isn't in it anymore.

In summary: I need a break from mafia and i should have subbed out long ago, but here i am.",71697,2017-06-03 02:50:00,4632

With 4 alive it takes 3 to lynch.
The game has been hammered.
FLAVORnancy rounds the corner to Mini's place. The street is in a state of relative quiet, and she begins to hurry with impatience. When she reaches the apartment door, she suddenly becomes aware that she no longer has her clutch with her. She checks herself in confusion for a moment and unpacks the carrybag full of chocolate before sighing with the realization that she must have left it back at Venchi. God fucking damn why has this has been such an awful morning?! She pulls out her phone and calls Mini to ask her to come down for her. She cries out as a sudden cramp crushes her and she curls up for a moment in an unsuccessful attempt to bear the pain.

Mini stutters in disbelief as she opens the door and sees the state her girlfriend is in. nancy breaks down with a desperate sob and buries her overflow of tears in Mini's shoulder.",71697,2017-06-03 05:55:00,4675
7930,nancy,"FLAVORFirst my FAVORITE PAIR OF SHOES, (Keyser SÃ¶ze, the pair of vegan, textile designer flats that she wears around the streets of Verona) got fucking ruined by a jar of pickles OF ALL THINGS.

Then my SUNGLASSES, (implosion, the pair of blue sunglasses with red-green-white patterning she bought from Agatha Ruiz de la Prada last Spring) which I loved and were fucking awesome, got CRUSHED against the wall because of that fucking rodent dog.

And after that my HAIR ELASTIC (Desperado, a simple thick black rubber hair band from the department store) snapped for no god damn reason and unless you have a decent one for me to use I have no way to keep my head tonight or I have to go all the way across town to get one.

At least I did get to see that god awful MRA PEDESTRIAN (Leonshade, an unmemorable men's rights activist who invariably nauseates women with his mansplaining and victim complex) take a beatdown from that lesbian couple. That was admittedly pretty delightful and enjoyed that for a good bit.

Except that the next thing I know my DESIGNER COAT (Aristophanes, the pink, white and orange coat she bought from Ida Klamborn when she and Mini were traveling together) got fucking destroyed by chocolate because that fucking girl can't watch where she's walking and had to spill her shit all over it. FUCK.

I did learn that my fucking ONLINE STALKER (camn, that fucking creeper she made the mistake of adding to social media last year who won't let up following her across the whole of the world wide web) got.... murdered.... which was.. good.. I guess. Fuck. I mean, that was a relief in a way?

But then the next thing I know I can't even remember our FIRST KISS (Nachomamma8, the memory of the kiss she shared with Mini outside the airport in Gothenburg), which is so fucking unbelievable that I tossed my ex's HALF-MOON NECKLACE (Titus, the necklace her first girlfriend gave her years ago for their first anniversary that she thought she had lost) into a random garbage bin on the way here and apparently also could not even remember my FIRST ORGASM WITH YOU, (Tammy, her memory of the first time she came in Mini's bed, eight days after they met) which just makes me hate myself completely because how the fuck can you forget that memory???? OF ALL THINGS.

Clearly I just have a fucking shit and worthless memory because I also forgot my CLUTCH PURSE, (Firebringer, the small, flame-red clutch adorned with four purple hearts that holds all her most valuable personal items, such as mace) at Venchi when I left there with the chocolate....

Mini pats nancy's hair as she recounts again the misfortunes she has suffered over the past hour or so on the way over when nancy suddenly tears herself away angrily and hurls her SMARTPHONE (Ginngie, the S8 she's been using the past two months to spam Mini with emoji and questionnaires) against the near wall. She screams sadly as fragments of smartphone explode against the wall, then glares in hysteria at Mini, pulls her VIAL OF MALE TEARS (Infinity 324, a small glass vial filled with every lesbian's most nutritious and savored meal.... may they never stop flowing) from her coat pocket and drains it onto the floor.

She doubles over in pain and seems on the brink of losing her balance as her PERIOD PAIN (Ser Arthur Dayne, the cramps that completely wreck her existence for several days each month) courses along her spine and through to the tips of her fingers and toes, quickly overwhelming and encompassing her entire body. Mini starts towards her hesitantly, with one arm outstretched, offering to help her upstairs to the apartment.",71697,2017-06-03 05:59:00,4676

No but seriously saying it with confidence and when you're not being suspected goes a long way to making it look believable.

7973,Ser Arthur Dayne,"
I'm sorry you felt this way! Not sure I see much where you're coming from, as in my town games I put in 110% effort (and I have like never pushed for quicklynches in any town game? Except maybe formerfish in gay mafia). I think outside of gay mafia I care a lot about the state of the game as town, that game was just half lurksacks and even then I put in a bunch of effort to sort the people doing nothing.

For this game (and my scum games in general) I just give people what they want and try to play the right keystrokes. I got hints that you had preconceived notions that I would be very anti-town for some reason (probably because of fake-claims in gay mafia? but like I said that game was a shitshow so meh) so I knew I can get away with anti-town behavior and you'd ride it off. Infinity was feeling demotivated and I felt by ~seeing where he's coming from~ he will subconsciously townread me. Nacho felt that I tend to give up and not care about the lynch much as time goes on, so I gave him the careless persona while still getting on Desperado and pushing that. Titus was feeling misunderstood, I tried to work with her and make her feel better and that I saw where she's coming from. I forgot who but someone had deep doubts about nacho, so I played my ~nacho paranoia~ card. Also by talking to you about the nacho doubts I had I knew you would spend time explaining it and delve deep into it, then I can ""see"" where you're coming from but still have my own doubts, which would both allow me to help out the nacho-scum boat while also looking like I'm scumhunting to you because I'm okay with reassessing my read. It also distracts you from scumhunting because you dedicate more resources to explaining nacho-town.

Idk it's the little things that go a long way.

Btw I think Prism said somewhere in one of the like dead PTs that Nacho's biggest strength isn't his scumhunting even though he's good at that, it's the mediating avoiding town infighting. I agree with that, and I think it's more about how he's extremely good ~townhunter~. It's SO hard getting townread by nacho as scum whereas he somehow townreads viable mislynches and can change people's minds. He townread both Alisae and Titus this game. He townread Ari also to a point where I felt like if I pushed it any further it would make me look scummy, so that was one mislynch evaporated. And scum is about counting down the number of mislynches you have left. It's why it was so crucial getting Desperado mislynch in before Leon, even if people pushed Leon the next day. AND if Nacho had more time I suspect the Desperado lynch was going to be impossible to push over Leon.",71697,2017-06-03 16:36:00,4719

I don't think most of the differences are because of my being a PR.

This game obviously had a million confident voices and I didn't have an especially high degree of confidence in my reads (not especially low either, but etc).

That probably came off harsher than I feel, but yeah gay mafia and laundry mafia to an extent is where I'm coming from.  I obviously don't feel that way all the time as our game we played at home a couple weeks ago, you were someone I heavily looked to to balance out my own reads.

But gay mafia was kinda the straw for me.  It's why in kings landing I felt somewhat at ease drawing scum because I knew that I didn't have to worry about antitown behavior as it wouldn't really matter so much.

Nacho and I were talking about this game last night and the red flags that were there that we missed, and we both think the quicklynches are what killed this game.  That day one quick lynch should ne er have happened ad was atrocious.  And you're right if nacho had had more time and the chance to come in and sort desperado he'd probably been able to stop that lynch, and regardless of it being a few days before deadline that should not have happened, especially without a claim.  That lynch was terrible.  Even the day three scum lynch was bad that it was so quick.  

Every single one of those killed towns chances to have the time necessary to really evaluate what was going on and reassess.  Not only that but it killed the morale and drive to even solve the game.  

Town just not working together didn't help either.

Thank you for everyone for playing!

I pretty much agree with Tammy's assessment of what killed the game for Town. This setup was mainly designed to give Town a significant communication advantage and ideally control of lynches through coordination with Daytalk, which was definitely happening early Day 1 but I think that pretty much ended around the point that Fro99er deathtunneled Keyser, and Town never really recovered its mojo after that. That was why scum had no daytalk, it was important for scum to be somewhat disconnected in terms of being able to coordinate and such, which was particularly relevant with the way the JK and BP BG worked in the setup as we saw when Ari got shot the first time, even though the WIFOM was far less since implosion got taken out Night 1. That was pretty much a perfect N1 kill, I think, in terms of undermining Town's chances to utilize its power to the fullest extent (not to mention implosion's reads were fucking incredible).

I honestly haven't had a chance to make a real post yet. I just got home from class a couple hours ago and told people that I was no longer confused about the thing I was initially confused about. Other than that, I've been rereading to get a grip on the game.

Looking over the BigYoshiFan/MortFeld/Gamma Emerald interaction, I feel like Yoshi has the greatest likelihood of being scum. I feel like even at L-1, a quick-hammer probably wouldn't be super likely from town. Could be he wanted to disavow an unlikely early lynch in order to look town. Or possibly, Gamma and he are scum partners and he was concerned that a quick-lynch would b bad for his team. It's weak, but it's something to consider.

I don't see anything wrong with MortFeld pushing Yoshi on his supposed concerns. It seemed like a valid line of questioning to me.

I thought he was town because his paranoia felt real. But you pointed out that scum can have genuine paranoia too. I don't completely agree, I think paranoia is different from just fear. But the type of paranoia that is hard for scum to replicate is absent from Yoshi's 45. So the townread is weak.

The point about scum not being paranoid that someone else is scum was like, a poorly fleshed out version of the above.

8143,Hikari Link,"

And yet it is, so here we are. You're making a lot of inaccurate assumptions here about my level of hubris. That bandwagon during RVS was getting big, but short of a grossly incompetent townie, an accidental hammer was very unlikely. Scum hammering and pretending to be inept town seems like it would have been a far more likely scenario to me. And neither side hammering seems like an even more likely scenario. If we accept that the lynch was extremely unlikely to occur and that scum would be most likely to hammer, then an early lynch would arguably have been more favorable for the town.

On the other hand, scum can get towncred for pretending to be scared of a lynch that early on. And, if Gamma truly is Yoshi's partner, Yoshi'd have every reason to be nervous, on the off-chance that an incompetent townie accidentally (or purposely, honestly) hammered there.

tl;dr: Irrespective of Gamma's alignment, Yoshi as town had more to gain from Gamma's death than he had to lose, while Yoshi as scum had more to gain from ending the wagon there.

There are, however, two holes in my thinking that I am aware of.

1. It's possible that Yoshi wouldn't have thought any of the things that I just thought, regardless of his alignment.
2. I've basically set up a scenario that regardless of how Gamma flips if we lynch him, Yoshi looks scummier to me. 

I realize the potential role confirmation bias may play in how I interpret Yoshi's actions from here on, but I don't plan to push forward with only this reasoning. I assume that as the game progresses, my scum read may be strengthened or it may be weakened. But at our current stage in the game, these are the best leads I've got (and I don't think they are bad), so I'm pursuing them until I have reason to believe I shouldn't.


Please do. It's something more people should think on.
Actually, as an avid PokÃ©mon fan myself, It's widely known within the community that PokÃ©mon themselves has been horribly inconsistent. Even within canon, many different PokÃ©mon has had many different pronunciations of the same PokÃ©mon. Most of the time, you'd go with any one so long others recognise it. The more common pronunciations of Delibird include ""Deh-Lee-Bird"", ""Dee-Lih-Bird"", ""Dail-Li-Bird"" and ""Del-Uh-Bird""

Lastly, sorry this post was so dense. I've always had a tough time being brief, but I've been told in the past that long posts are anti-town because some people won't bother reading them and/or they feel like it's just a method of trying to appear active. I'll try to keep things as short as possible in the future, but I personally prefer to be thorough so that I am not misunderstood.

Writing off somebody as town because ""that's how they play as town"" or ""that's just their playstyle"" are very bad habits that people really need to stop. Mimicking town play as scum has to be the easiest thing in the world to do.

Spoiler: Off Topic Regarding the Pronunciation of Delibird 
I can understand this perspective, but when I talk about pronunciation, I do so from the perspective of intent. I believe that the only intent that makes sense here is a pronunciation based on the word ""delivered.""

Spoiler: BigYoshiFan 
Is pointing out a useless post really useless? What reasons do you have for your reads. If a person isn't transparent in their thinking, they can't expect to be understood.

I also feel like you're also being really defensive right now, yet you haven't responded to my accusations.

On top of this, I don't feel like there is much from you in the way of scumhunting.

To be clear, I'm not saying ""being defensive is scummy"" and ""defend yourself from me."" That would be hypocritical and unfair. I'm saying two things. First, you appear to be being defensive while ignoring my suspicion of you, which seems suspect to me. Second, if you are town (which I'm still not convinced of at all), please scum/townhunt. And I'd also ask that you do it in a more transparent way so that it is clear what you are trying to do.

Spoiler: Transcend 
I'm admittedly long-winded, and I apologize for that. But I'd rather my thinking be made transparent. I don't like leaving room for misinterpretation in what I say. It makes it easier to understand my thinking, even when it's flawed. On top of that, it gives me less wiggle room to say stuff like ""I didn't mean it that way.""

That said, in what way are my posts bullshit?


I'm going to have to disagree with you there.

For example, your assertion that I was posting a lot without saying anything isn't even really true. I had 5 out of the 83 posts when you voted me. Two were during RTS. One was asking for clarification of a vote that I didn't understand. One was acknowledging that I now understood the previous message. The last was an acknowledgment that my quote was bad, to clarify that I understood that a mistake had been made. Do you have something against clarity of communication? Because I happen to believe it's very important.

On top of that, you make a really weak accusation that I went into tryhard mode after you voted me, despite the fact that I posted it a mere 10 minutes after your claim that I was posting a lot without saying much. I wish I could produce a post like that in 10 minutes. I usually spend upwards of an hour on a post, which I'll grant, you have no way of verifying. I've got to read, reread, fact-check, contemplate, and solidify my thoughts. Then I have to carefully select my words in order to remove as much ambiguity from my posts as possible, that way it can be clear to everyone exactly what I'm saying. And don't even get me started on the time I spend on BBCode to try to make things as intelligible as possible. Incidentally, that's why I made the comment regarding my messed up quote. Like I said, I'm pretty code with it. What I forgot about this site is that every now and then, when you click the quote button, the quote just appears messed up. I only even realized it because it happened to me again earlier. I'm pretty sure that's a bug that's been around since 2011 and I'm honestly kind of surprised it still exists.

My point is, even if you question my motives, I like to think that there is very little room for interpretation regarding the content of my words.


Could you please elaborate on this?

Spoiler: MortFeld 
That's exactly right. In fact, Titus made an excellent post in one of the discussion forums about this very topic. On top of which, strong communication is already something I am deeply interested in. I'm currently studying to be an Industrial/Organizational Psychologist. I won't bore you with all the details, but having clear communication and relying on understanding a plurality of ideas are key components to making an organization successful. Hence my boner for clear communication.


I'm an admitted tryhard. I'd be happy to link you to a few of my past games if you don't believe me. Though I warn you, they're from a time when I was an uncooperative, (more) arrogant piece of shit. That's why I scrubbed my wiki page. Didn't really want those games associated with my current brand.

I'm not sure what to tell you if you think my Yoshi vote was bad. I've explained my reasoning to the best of my ability and I stand by it. It certainly wasn't the strongest case ever made, but it wouldn't be, considering there were less than 4 pages of content available at the time. Hell, I'm pleasantly surprised we were even out of RVS at that point.

Spoiler: MarioManiac4 
Could you please explain these reads?

Spoiler: Titus 
In what way did they lack depth? Maybe I am projecting my own thought process, but the intent of Mort's line of questioning seemed pretty clear. And you're making it sound like he asked a bunch of unrelated questions to look busy. It was a pretty clear back and forth.

Spoiler: TwoFace 


You know, I've heard this argument several times as I've played Mafia and other deception games and I never quite understood it. Town have extremely legitimate reasons to worry about looking suspicious. People can and are misinterpreted and mislynched. I can't speak for anyone else, but being mislynched or mistrusted is one of the most frustrating things in this game for me, especially in LyLo. It's possible to interpret that a line of questioning is being asked solely for the purpose of setting you up as a fall guy. This is compounded by the fact that townies are 100% certain that they are innocent and they sometimes overestimate how apparent that should be to everybody else.

That said, I generally agree with you and I don't think town should live in fear of that. Especially when it comes to vanilla townies. Not that I'm interpreting Yoshi as either a VT or a power role, I'm just saying in terms of game theory, VTs are expendable as hell and should be willing to jump on a grenade for most power roles. Mislynches can and will happen, there's no avoiding it. If it happens to you, it sucks, but oh well. So I think it's better to be loud and proud about your opinions if you are a member of the town and if you die, have some amount of faith that your team will find a way to turn your death into an advantage. Not everybody has that level of dedication to their team though. Some are just here to play a fun game. And there's nothing wrong with that; it's just not as helpful.

Spoiler: Ircher 
At this point, I'd like to point out that I always have been and always will be overly paranoid of people trying to buddy me. I am always concerned that I'm subject to confirmation bias, so I worry all of my reads are wrong and that everybody who trusts me is Mafia trying to manipulate me. That's a personal issue and I try not to let it throw me off too much, but it can be an issue when I ever survive until LyLo. I'm directing this more at the entire game in general, rather than just you. Your post is just the one that pushed my paranoia over the edge. I acknowledge it's relatively unfounded though.


I can't agree with this more. Based on your current posts, I have a feeling I'm really going to like you as a player, but I'm also really going to fear that you are going to stab my back. Again, I will try to not let this undue paranoia control me and if anybody notices me being paranoid, please call me out on it.

tl;dr: 
1. It seems to me that Yoshi is being defensive against TwoFace while ignoring my accusations and is also not really scumhunting.

2. Transcend has grossly exaggerated the infractions that I've committed that make me scum in his eyes and I'd like to know his reasoning for his reads, particularly on Mario.

3. My emphasis on clear communication is a result of my field of study.

4. My tryhard nature is extremely apparent in any game I've been in on this site. It has nothing to do with my role and everything to do with my playstyle.

5. I don't fully understand Mort's misgivings about my Yoshi vote, because I feel I've sufficiently explained it. If it needs more elaboration, please ask. If it's just a gut thing, please say so.

6. I'd like Mario to explain his reads.

7. TwoFace already covered this in #210, but Mort's line of questioning was valid.

8. Townies have legitimate reason to fear being set up for a mislynch, but they should not let that fear control them.

9. I'm paranoid about people buddying me and that all of my reads are wrong. These things may cause me to react irrationally at points. Please let me know when that seems to be the case.

Basically, Hikari reads as a player that people can easily jump on for absolutely nothing. Transcend made this obvious to me by misrepping his 98 that explained that he found Yoshi most likely to be scum out of Yoshi/Gamma/Mort. (In particular, Transcend tried to present as there must be scum in the group.) 105 and 112 help reinforce my townread as they appear to be genuine responses. 128 as town reevaluating despite the lack of significant reason for the vote change -- it doesn't read as scum that is backpedaling from a possibly controversial read. 140 by Delbird once again reinforces the easy-to-misread feel on Hikari.

Transcend- his unpredictability and tone feel town completely.

That said, could you guys please tell me why you refuse to read wall posts? I've always thought it's a pretty anti-town attitude.

Also, you don't really need to read the parts about you, TwoFace. It was me explaining why I feel town members have every right to fear being suspected. Transcend, I'd really appreciate if you read my response to you. I feel I rather adequately dismantled your case against me.

Regarding the Transcend wagon: I don't like this wagon. Most games I've got at least one townie tunneling me hard. I just set some people off for some reason. It's rarely (if ever) scum who have this reaction. I don't think there was much for Transcend to gain as scum for pushing me as hard as he did for such poor reasons as scum.

Town shouldn't care how people perceive them. Town shouldn't worry about being mislynched. Especially if you don't do scummy things. Every townie who's been mislynched has been guilty of doing things that they shouldn't have done. Lying, lurking, contradictions, whatever. 

Be transparent, honest, and active and don't worry about how you are perceived. That's how I always play. Go look at all my games. I give zero fucks what people think of me. I tell the truth, I stay active, and I call things as I see it.

I agree with you on some points regarding theory and disagree on others. But even if your playstyle is objectively the best (which it may not be), not everyone is going to agree that that's the case. Meaning you need to be prepared to accept alternate playstles if you don't want to mislynch. Whether or not town should be worried about being mislynched doesn't help us determine if somebody is scum. That's because there are plenty of town who do worry about being mislynched.",71675,2017-05-04 10:48:00,324

Nobody would lynch anyone off contradicting themselves but if they have a body of work full of scummy things (cough transcend cough) they should definitely be in the lynch pool. 

And sorry I play with an I don't care how people perceive me attitude and I'm able to convince people to lynch who I want usually. If you play honest, you can't be scummy. When people try to do things to make themselves look town or do things (or in some cases don't do things) because they are afraid of how they will be perceived, that's scummy. 

Take transcend's ""I'm going to obv town "" statement. There is literally no reason a townie should have to say something like that. His entire iso is basically LAMIST (look at me I'm so town). It's forced and unnatural (not to mention scummy) and because of that I can't trust him. I can't see town motivation for it.",71675,2017-05-04 22:31:00,390

I'm not trying to insult you, but I've really got to disagree. You're not being super toxic, but a few of your attitudes could be perceived as toxic and could absolutely drive somebody away.

1. Your implication that different playstyles are scummy.

2. Your apparent unwillingness to acknowledge the legitimacy of other people's feelings about the game.

3. Your insistence that you haven't even done anything that would drive people away.

You may feel that you are new and improved (and you probably are), but there is always room for improvement. Some of your attitudes can come across as arrogant and toxic.

I've been in similar positions. Back around 2007-2010, I was a really shitty person. I was a little better by the time I joined this site, 2011, but still an arrogant prick. After I left, I worked to become a better person, and I thought I had. But after learning more about relationships in around 2015, I realized that I was still an asshole, so I kept working at it. Flash forward to now and I'm still a work in progress. How I am now is like night and day from how I was 10 years ago, but I still feel like I have a long way to go. I believe that not being an asshole is a lifetime pursuit; the second you think you aren't an asshole is the second you fail.

Again, this is not an attack on you as a person, TwoFace. It's just something I think you may want to consider. Now I really do need to do other things today.",71675,2017-05-04 23:59:00,459

No, I'm saying that your policies are poor because they don't allow for context whatsoever. You seem to act as though everything happens in a vacuum, when it does not. Some of the things Transcend did could certainly be considered scummy, but you don't seem to consider the larger perspective of why a townie might be motivated to do them.


I'm referring to your comments about townies being worried about looking scummy.  

Maybe this will help:
>People don't like losing. 
>Being mislynched feels like losing to some townies. 
>Some townies don't want to be mislynched because it feels like they are losing. 
>Some townies will avoid being incriminated so that they are not mislynched, because being mislynched is tantamount to loss, in their mind.

Now consider this: 
>This is a thought process that some people have. 
>You are saying people should not think this way.
> Some people don't like being told how to think.
> You appear to be telling them how to think.
> Those people will not like you because they feel you are telling them how they have to think.

The attitude of being preoccupied with staying alive, rather than trying to help the town, is definitionally anti-town. It's literally putting oneself above the town. However, it's not inherently scummy in that it is not inherently scum-motivated, since town can (and do) often have this motivation.

Geese this is like every game I play. 

I can't control what I find scummy. I do try to look for town motivation but I don't see any. I also don't see anyone explaining it to me either. 

Like why would town feel the need to force people to townread them by doing stupid things instead of just letting happen natural by doing the towniest thing you could do, scum hunt?

Transcend didn't bother to explain to me why he did what he did. Neither did anyone else.",71675,2017-05-05 00:40:00,472
8475,TwoFace,"
  

So I because I think townies should play care free, I'm disregarding people's feelings? Meh that's a stretch. 

People don't like losing - I agree so they should scum hunt. They shouldn't decided to make a bunch of BS posts and say ""look I'm obvtowning"" because you aren't going to find scum that way and you're going to draw negative attention on you instead. 

Being mislynched feels like losing - i get that so do everything in your power to prevent that. Scum hunt, ask questions, make good arguments and respond appropriately when people disagree with you. If you still get lynched you at least left behind a good body of work. If you don't do these things you have hurt town, not helped. 

Some townies avoid being incriminated - I don't understand this one. Maybe this is a skill level thing? If you give out your honest opinions and somebody disagrees with you and you can intelligently defend yourself, then you've done nothing to incriminate yourself. If you lie, or are dishonest, or do things to force people to read you a certain way than yes you deserve being incriminated. 

My game philosophy is quite simple. It's very old school but still works. 

The main problem is townies who decide to degrade their town game because they know they can't play well as scum. They have to muddy the waters. 

I can't tell the difference between scummy town and scummy scum. Just like I can't tell the difference between townie town and townie scum. 

If my opinions of how people should play is toxic to anyone I suggest you stop talking about them.",71675,2017-05-05 00:52:00,473

Goddammit! Last post really was meant to be the last one, but this stood out too much, so I feel like I must respond.

1. If TwoFace were to understand the points that I'm making, then he might not scumread Transcend, which in turn would mean that he might not scumread his replacement. 
2. His current attitudes have a strong chance of leading to mislynches, particularly with his power role. This discussion is extremely important.
3. Could we even take it outside of the game? I feel like that would technically be considered discussing an ongoing game.

All that said, I'm not attempting to change his mind. I'd like him to understand the points I'm making so that he'll change his mind of his own volition, but I ultimately can't and won't tell him how to think. To that end, I will continue to clarify any of the points I've made and respond to his responses on the topic when I can.

This again also?

Granted this game I get 2 votes, but how would my attitude lead to mislynches?

I am not responsible for the free will of every other person in the game. Let's assume transcend is town and assume we have 3 mafia voting him also (very rare)

That's still only 5 votes. 2 other townies would also have to vote.

How would that be my fault?

What about the townies not on the wagon? 

Do you realie that up until this point in the game I have yet to see anyone make a compelling argument as to why

1. Transcend is town (this is how he plays isn't compelling)
or
2. Why somebody else is more likely to be scum. 

If transcend isn't scum, make a convincing case. Outline a bunch of posts or reasons so I can read and evaluate them to see if I agree.

In normal circumstances, I'd agree. But it's suspect to me that you made a show about replacing out and the mod ignored your request, but then replaced somebody else. 

Then you said you wanted out with your little poem and the Mod admonished you, but still didn't replace you. Then you decided not to get replaced. 

Suuuuuuuper convenient that you made that decision before XnadrojX took you seriously and replaced you. Good thing he didn't replace you before NotTheRealPaul.",71675,2017-05-05 13:34:00,524

Ircher has indeed not done a whole bunch but what he has done does feel like it comes from town. TwoFace isn't an IC but he seems townie to me.

When Transcend was still in and I hadn't voted him yet it seemed to me like it could really just be a playstyle thing, but by the time he subbed out he changed literally nothing and just kept spewing what at least seemed to be nonsense the entire time. And I feel like it's deliberate, and hence scum motivated.

Wagons can easily shift over time even if for a few days there are only a couple of people that are being focused on/wagoned. Unless 75% of the town says a person is scum (or there is evidence from a cop/similar), wagons can change, and therefore scum is not caught at all.

[/quote]Again, you're misunderstanding me and your feelings on giving up aren't relevant here, because what I said has nothing to do with giving up. 

I'm saying that different people have different ideas of when they are caught. For example, I tend to feel caught as scum when 15%-25% of people suspect me and or when nobody townreads me. So you can't (or at least, shouldn't) apply your definition of caught to them when you don't know when they feel like they are caught.

On top of that, I'm saying that both Titus and Transcend could've considered themselves caught scum, yet still replaced out because they didn't like the attitudes of players in the game.

I'm not buying this stance on transcend. I don't think it's accurate or fair to say that transcend wasn't doing anything and was only spewing nonsense. Seems more like you're scumreading him for doing things you don't like-- such as attitude and trying to lynch you and titus. It's true that he wasn't explaining much but I think you're exaggerating how cuHrayZee rAnd0m anTi-t0wN transcend was acting. 

Could also go for a Mario wagon. Seems to be coasting by townreading too many people and acting exasperated about it.

107 jumps into a discussion from 98 and contextualizes it as figuratively gladiating me and Yoshi. 1. completely unnecessary 2. the discussion was about who in {Gamma, me, Yoshi} is most likely to be scum so I'm not sure why Gamma would give his input there anyway

121 says he's letting people know his reads by gladiating us in this way which is bullshit (122)

235 see 238, 242, 243, 246. The fact that double voter is very close to IC because of setup history doesn't change what I was saying a whole lot. It's not that I don't think he should be TRing TwoFace there, it's that it feels like he got there so easily. Like the doublevote is a convenient way to justify prior knowledge that TF is town. 250 never answered, I think 248 was trolling but still avoidant.

That's the early stuff. I have to admit I've barely read anything since Transcend replaced out. I usually read sections of the game multiple times but can't really be assed this game. If GE has done anything relevant since then, lmk, but I seriously doubt it.",71675,2017-05-08 06:15:00,824

OK

I take this to mean:

Mario had an MMM case. 699 made that case no longer scum indicative.

So here's Mario's specific MMM case that 699 addresses:

The implication is that Mario thinks that Transcend calling MMM an idiot (which didn't happen exactly like that but whatever) was MMM's reason for voting Transcend. What I'm curious about is what Mario thinks MMM's reason is now. Because that is not contained within 699, and the post that does contain it has a few issues that I think Mario should go into.

Also, how does MMM's explicit offense at being called an idiot imply that he was looking for a way out of the Transcend vote?",71675,2017-05-08 15:50:00,835

because he says that we should ignore his posts on transcend because they were based off of emotions and presumably not really because this was scummy. i thought this would provide an avenue to unvote transcend and back out of his points. if he did this, this would lead to him not actually wanting to be on the transcend wagon.",71675,2017-05-08 16:00:00,840

That first post you originally explained why never made sense to me and it still doesn't. I somehow missed the 2nd post and my first thought was why would it be weird for Titus to be convinced by my post when my post as previously stated by me was fucking awesome. 

The things I pointed out that transcend did are still undisputed scummy. Nobody including you has explained how any of transcends actions could come from town. 

People town reading transcend basically cause of meta or ""bad feeling "" worry me. But being wrong also worries me.

I joined this game because it needed replacements and there were several older and newer players I was interested in playing with.  To come into a game maligned before I've even made my first post is completely unacceptable and hostile IMO.

I have not started my read yet so I do not know why Titus has got the votes he does and I doubt I'll be able to answer for anything he may have done.  If anyone who is on my wagon is not committed to their vote on my predecessor I would request you unvote me (due to my NAI looming 2F two votes later) temporarily at least and see where you are at wrt this slot after I have caught up.

As for my post formatting...that's completely NAI and indicative of what I have to put up with 2F.  I post long walls with links to comments typically only when I am catching up from several pages (ex. after weekends or when replacing in) because it's easier for me on my phone then actually quoting multiple comments.

Do you want 40 pages of him and I arguing back and forth? because as soon as he says something that isn't true or I disagree with I am going to respond to it. He will in turn respond back and it will be 40 pages of us arguing.

I have this inability to ignore things. I still am forcing myself not to respond to all of the posts he has made thus far and I know as soon as he makes those wall posts and mentions my name all hell is going to break loose. 


I really don't understand why he replaced into this game. When I replace into a game i look at the playerlist and if I see somebody that I know is going to create issues, I refrain and move on. He knows that we don't get along together. A reasonable person would recognize that it probably would be a good idea to avoid joining not only for the sake of the game but for the sake on himself being able to enjoy the game.

lol...make that 5 votes on Gamma.

Some confusion between BYF and Mort on ""why tf not"".  I think Mort meant TwoFace and BYF meant ""the fcuk"".  Communication breakdown.  Or I'm wrong.

Still mostly RVS and reminiscing through page 3.  Transcend scum reading Gamma for tbd reason?  And Hiraki?  And Titus (boo)?...and Transcend (wtf?).

Tr'ing Hiraki

Ooooo....this post format is very very baaaaaad.  j/k

This Transcend post feels like it's making something out of nothing wrt MMM's scumpool post.  Also not getting his lynch Hiraki sentiment.

@MMM...your Mort comments in posts 127 and 131, so close to each other, seem contradictory wrt Mort.  (which Mort and Hiraki question afterwards as well)

Hey...surprise surprise...I agree with TwoFace.

Gamma's 188 was a good chuckle.

@icher...amen.

wrt this Mort post...up to this point I'm townreading Mort...and tbd on Gamma.  But I do not think the observation Mort is making on Gamma in this post is accurate.  I saw nothing wrong with Gamma's 235.  At best it was NAI...certainly nothing suspect about it.  On that note I was leaning town on TwoFace up to this point and the doublevoter makes that lean more pronounced.  Though not confirmed by any means.

I didn't even realize Gamma was L-2.  That wagon feels like it came out of nowhere (IMO).  OK...further look and Ircher just revoting.  I hate that.  L-3 still a decent Gamma wagon.  Two trs and two TBDs on it.  I'll look at more closely after I'm caught up.

@BYF...You're TRing Gamma because he gave early page 2 TRs on you and Mort?  That seems like awfully thin reasoning to TR someone.  Scratch that...other reasons given.  I will agree that Gamma calling out Transcend for his posting messes with my suspect grouping (bussing aside).  Though he (Gamma) doesn't put his vote were his shade falls until the bottom of this same page.

@Mort...are you saying you're impressed with Transcend's reads in this game or that you were in your previous game with him?

 ]@Mario... why are you null reading TwoFace?  What is your read on him disregarding his double vote role?

Several players still barely posting.  I know replacements are in the near future but all active would be nice.

@Mort... 1) Tarkus gives reads.  2) You ask Tarkus for GE read.  3) Gamma highlights Tarkus read on GE (i.e. null on everyone else) and 4) you shade Gamma's ""3"" and saying Tarkus did ""1"" because of ""2"".  But that order doesn't work with what you are saying and once again I do not see how what Gamma did was shade worthy??

Neither of them are around to discuss this but I thought Transcend's 398 came across as coercing Titus through reverse psychology to help Transcend shed his wagon...then votes Titus for not defending him.  Despite the fact that just a RL day earlier Titus was leaning town on Transcend.

Lot's of drama on Page 17.  Transcend and TwoFace having a little go at each other.  MMM pissed at Transcend of being rude.  smh....  Goosfraba people....goosfraba...

@BYF...I don't see Transcend's replace out anything that he wouldn't do as scum.  Not sure a TR for it is warranted.  Do you have a lot of game experience with Transcend?  And if he is suddenly a TR for you...why wait almost two pages to unvote him instead of when you decided he was a TR?

@BYF...I'm TR'ing Hiraki as well but this is laying it on a bit thick 

And page 19 evolves into a TwoFace counseling session.  inb4FOUL!!!  No ""shot"" intended....just an observation.

A mild TR on Paul by Transcend?  WTF?

@TwoFace...maybe you should just request a rule where no mods are able to start a game or allow replacements unless players have been vetted through you?   smh....

I don't have a read on Mario and it bugs me.  I think an ISO on he and Gamma will be first priorities following this catch up.  Assuming I'm still alive.

-Grey- is coming across as town in his entrance to the game.  A little snarky but town nonetheless.  And while reading him I get to post 588 where he quotes a TwoFace post (which I seem to have overlooked??) that says the last scum double voter was in 2009.  I believe it.  2F TR getting stronger.

Ha... Grey notices the same BYF unvote delay on Transcend as I point our earlier.

Add MMM to my ISO pile based on 631....though his 634 is a good retort.

I'm not even sure why Titus replaced out.  I assume he is referring to TwoFace but I didn't see anything between the two of them?

Caught up to post 750.  Read through went slower than I expected.  I'm just posting this to show the read through was in work and I will summarize and give reads when I finish.  Which might not be until tomorrow (I have company in town so mafia time is a bit thin).

I see the concern with Titus flipping her transcend read, but she replaced before addressing it and there are enough posts in-between that I'm not scumreading her for it. 

L1 makes a difference because it gives scum the hammer in a situation where I don't think it's necessary yet, when we still have things to gain by letting replacements and CDB catch up. With the current mood, I don't think they'd get a lot of pushback for it.

He hasn't been exploring other options for a while now and I think tunneling on titus to this extent for the reasons he has given is scummy.

1. Yes I forgot I blacklisted him
2. You were voting kop for a single incident that happened Day 1. EARLY day 1 at that (your issue with him was voting without reading everything first). You came in day 3 AFTER a scum lynch and dropped a vote without reading (see the issue I had with your vote? See the similarities between you and kop?) you had no legit reasons for your scum read on kop. So yay you found scum based purely on luck. 
3. You ONLY voted the one of the scum because he was the alternative to you. This other scum just so happened to be the person you were hard town reading almost the entire game and refused to explain to anyone why. You did a 180 out of the blue. Your other vote of scum was purely omgus and people were town reading that slot. 

You refused to answer direct questions, your pushes lacked any reasoning, your more serious votes only came after you were under pressure of being lynched, and you basically did nothing to help town. Multiple people thought your play was terrible. I'd say hand down it's the worst performance I've ever seen from anyone.

4. If you were truly looking for a friendly game of mafia there is zero chance you would pick this game.

You make these kinds of posts more often than that. Mainly cause you avoid posting daily. The problem with these posts is it is impossible to read and respond to on a mobile device cause you have to keep going back and forth in your browser. You can't easily quote specific information without losing the hyperlink to the post number and by the time you reach the bottom you've gone back and forth 30 times. Hell its difficult to respond on a computer also for essentially the same reasons. 

Im willing to bet most people would prefer you quote a post, say what you have an issue with, and move to the next post. Plus not everything you include in these posts need to be included. You throw things in that have either been answered already or are now irrelevant. 

I can understand doing it after catching up from a replacement. But doing it after a weekend or any other time after the catch-up is completely unnecessary.

Spoiler: Right here 
Sorry your posts are very tl;dr-y and I try to read the full posts regardless of whether they address me to gain full understanding of your viewpoints and when it does address me, like just now, I lose sight of what we're actually arguing about. Or in this case talking since, according to you, you're not arguing (which I now only have a vague recollection of - exams are stressful).
If you'd like me to say anything else about this reiterate please and I'll have a look at it again.

This is... actually a really good point, and suggests to me that both Transcend and Titus' subs are town (I believe they were both at L-2 when that was posted)

So we're chaining replace outs now...?

I actually think you make solid points but what IS shit about you is your attitude.

This regarding all the sub ins, including the one for Transcend, and on that note
UNVOTE: 
because honestly even if I was to keep the lynch I don't think it'll happen at this rate

I don't know if I said this yet but I don't want to read TwoFace based on him being a doublevoter and I don't think anyone else should do it.


I feel like Hikari is town because his posts show very clearly that he is trying to advance the game and I'm only marginally less certain on this read after seeing him say he shows these attitudes as either alignment.

I already pointed out like 5 posts after the post you linked that Mort isn't one of the two scum reads I mentioned.

I'm not obvtowning him for having a role that is uncommon on scum, period. I do town read him but I really want to emphasise it's because of his contributions and not his role.

Now that you mention it that seems entirely possible especially since I overly sympathise with the situation of wanting transcend lynched for being bullshit

My attitude was fine until the person who knows we are like oil and water decided to replace in. It's like a guy walking into a room filled with explosive gas and lighting a match. The outcome is known before he does it but does it  anyway. 

I wanted to play a game without any drama and first I get accused of being toxic when I wasn't and now a player  intentionally replaces in this game knowing that we can't be civil with each other because historically we've never been able to be civil and he acts like he has no idea that I'd be mad about it.",71675,2017-05-09 22:58:00,991

What question",71675,2017-05-09 23:20:00,998
9001,Ircher,"Titus Evaluation

1. 38 --> Votes Mort cuz she doesn't like his responses --> I disagree greatly with the assessment. His reads look fine imo and show a town thought process. It seems more like Titus is simpl trying to find something she can attack herself -- how ironic!

2. 171 --> Elaborates on Mort read; mainly states that Mort's stuff lacks depth and asks too many questions --> Honestly, I still feel like Titus is trying to find things to attack; Titus made the original read about 1 1/2 pages into the game. So, w/ RVS et cetera, there isn't going to be a lot to analyze so questions won't have a lot of depth. While the # of Qs Mort asked was kinda high, I don't necessarily see it as scum-motivated.

3. 177 --> Admits reasoning was bad cuz trying to get things going --> And this feels like Titus is distancing from her read. Had she said this way earlier, I might buy it, but this seems to be Titus thinking ""Oops! I better try to play that read off as non-serious"". I don't buy it at all.

4. 178 --> Mort/Yoshi pinged her as partners --> This early in the game? I mean, 68 kinda pinged me as Titus / MMM being possible partners, but by no means did I see a solid association between the two. Unless Titus elaborates later, this association read feels superficial and an attempt to appear to have reads while simultaneously casting shade at another player.

5. 182 --> Transcend is weak town --> I would like to note that this happened after Transcend said that town!Titus pretty much always defends him at this point in the game. Titus is obviously trying to keep her options open.

6. 387 --> Asks how Tarkus can see things as her on Mort despite not understanding Titus's posts --> Different perspective perhaps? Feels like another shade-throwing attempt. Not to mention that Titus hasn't been too specific in her read, so it's pretty difficult to understand when one quotes zero evidence.

7. 408 --> Says town!Trans actually pressures people --> What suggests he isn't? Also, I honestly don't see the difference between Transcend here and Transcend in 1900. Again, I think this is scum Titus keeping her options open.

So that is my not meta-based case on Titus.",71675,2017-05-09 23:47:00,999

I think you have spent too much time around 2F.  I simply read through the last 10 pages last night and noticed a couple of your posts along the lines of not being as active lately as you want to.  So what?  Did it change my read of you?  No.  It was a minor observation.

If I had made the same observation but said ""I'm town reading Mort...mostly for his early play, but he seems to have tailed off a bit on his activity.  But still a town read for now.""  Would you still have responded with a ""f**k you?""  Which was totally uncalled for and a bit of a surprise coming from you based on your play up to that point.


Speaking of behavior...

Spoiler: TwoFace Your play in this game (and others) goes beyond unacceptable.  The fact you yourself feel the need to change your play...and even you admit you are an asshole when you play mafia shows you are aware of your MASSIVE personality/teamwork flaws.  Every game I have seen you in you get into nasty exchanges with people (not just me) that more often than not just lead to people replacing out or mislynches thanks to you.  I suspect that the reason you do not want to share your previous main's identity...that you claim experience playing with me as...is because it was probably banned for assholery and you are playing as TwoFace to skirt the ban.  Maybe a TwoFace ban is somewhere close in the future.  One can dream 

In this game alone you have had major issues with four players and you have been admonished or criticized by at least four others!  That's EIGHT players that have had exchanges with you based on your behavior and not the game.  Maybe more that I just overlooked.  And that eight is not counting the mod who has had to try and reel in gameplay (to little avail).

Our last game (which you signed up for after I did you hypocrite) you weren't quite as bad as you have been in this ""new improved"" version of you.  And after I was mislynched in large part due to you you still flaked out of that game for in part...player incompatibilities.  Scum even thanked you after the game for being such a valuable member of their team...and you were town!  lol....

Another example was recent completed game I chose not to replace into because you, DSOC, were having a ""toxic"" exchange with another player (MOI) that resulted in you getting kicked out of the game.  It goes on and on...smh....

I'm not really sure why you even play this game.  You are obviously socially challenged.  All you do is complain about other people in your games....you whine like a little ____ to mods and site admins for the slightest offense and you act like a total child.  I envision you falling on the floor next to your computer and throwing a tantrum when something pisses you off.  It's absurd.

And yet you're hilarious at the same time.  The points you make are assinine at best and usually misguided.  Your reads are terrible and yet you have never done anything wrong in the game of Mafia.  Anyone you have ever been wrong about when you are town is at fault.  It's their fault they got mislynched...they didn't act town.  They were scummy.  Not your bad.

Bullshit!  lol.....

And to say you hate someone on this website who is just trying to play a game is psychotic.  Someone who your primary objections to are related to post formatting!? It's just a game that you are bad at and make other people miserable in...except scum.  If you are seeing a therapist I would recommend you ask them to up your meds.  If you aren't....you should consider seeing one immediately.  I would be very afraid to be in any post offices in your neighborhood.

I will not avoid playing in games you are in if I'm interested in the player list.  If that makes you miserable....that's your problem.  I have no problem being in a game with you and will not penalize myself by avoiding the chance to play with players I actually look forward to playing with just because of your cancerous presence.
As for this game...I'm not scum.  I can't defend anything Titus did but those scum reading her are wrong (or scum).  Assuming someone else doesn't lay a vote on me in the meantime...I'll give a little more details on my reads shortly as promised.",71675,2017-05-10 13:25:00,1032

9075,Hikari Link,"Hey, guys, sorry for my general absence from this game. I've just been pretty busy and catching up here has been difficult. Mostly just been skimming recently.

Looking at the Wiki, it seems like the Watcher is generally considered a pretty cheap role as town, but a pretty acceptable role as scum, so I suppose maybe their is something to TwoFace's concerns regarding a fake claim. Of course, he also said that a Mafia Double Voter is pretty uncommon. It could be completely possible that the mod has gone with a setup that's balanced, but full of relatively unused roles. So if TwoFace ever flips scum or havingfitz flips town, we may want to start looking at the other.

For now, I say we let fitz live and see if he can bring us actionable information. Honestly, I kinda just want this day to end so we can get a flip and stop poking around in the dark. Unless somebody has a better idea right now, I say we go with WhemeStar.

9149,havingfitz,"Reads...and these are pretty much in order from top to bottom (though any adjacent reads are pretty much interchangeable with the exception of CDB):

TwoFace - I was leaning on him being town before I started my catch up based on double voter.  As I read through it seemed like the same town TwoFace I've played with and ID'd correctly numerous times before.  The DV solidifies a town read here.

Hikari Link - I just read him as town.  I read his posts (game related...not biographical or theory related) and it's like he was reading my mind att when he voted BYF.  It looks like he is trying to solve the game and think things out.  I liked what I saw from him in my last game (I died coughcough before he replaced in) and he was town.  This feels the same.  If he is scum I would be very impressed.

RayFrost - Nothing to do with NTRPaul or RayFrost.  This is all -Grey-.  I thought he replaced in and made genuine efforts to make progress and was very like-minded to what I was thinking.  He posted a shitload in a short amount of time and didn't care if he pissed anyone off as long as he was

Tarkus - he was a non entity until page 15 and then he kicked things into gear.  Clear and concise and not hiding what he's thinking which will help keep him accountable/read him as the game goes on.  He could have stayed quiet with my wagon and let its momentum carry on but he voiced objection to it and tried to reign in the game.  I know scum could do that for towncred but Tarkus feels town.

MortFeld - I haven't really had a problem with any of Mort posts.  I liked his early game efforts to get the game moving.  The only real negative (aside from the activity thing I mentioned later which I'm not really that hung up on) is that some of the pushes he made on Gamma seemed unfounded IMO.  Ex. 246 and  246.  I'm undecided atm on Gamma and I still like Mort as town but I feel these two pushes are misguided.

MarioManiac - Didn't really notice him much on my catch up...not a good thing...until Post 770.  Very similar to my thoughts on people.  Like minded to me is good.  Not sure why he was reading TwoFace as null at one point in the game but he's stepped up his participation after a slow start.  Engaged and likeminded = tr for me.

ChannelDelibird - nada.  Was looking forward to playing with CDB but I suspect this will be a replace out. (Same with the RayFrost slot)

MMM - Even though he has posted a lot he is kind of nul.  I'm having a hard time finding a preponderance of good or bad stuff to push me one way or the other.  I know people have called him out for a few things but he seems to explain himself out of situatiojns.  Because he's town and there was no issue to begin with or because he's scum and can form decent explanations?  IDK.

Gamma Emerald - I didn't like him giving out early TR's on Mort and BYF (post 33?).  Other than that...I know as I was going through my catch up I was feeling suspicion towards Gamma but in hindsight I don't think it was for anything he had done himself than as much as it was a residual feeling from all the suspicion (votes anyway) from others.  Kind of a where there's smoke there's fire thing.  I don't like his wanting to string me up to potentially make use of a tell which is questionable to begin with...would require that I actually flip scum...and would have required that I'd actually provided some content to work from.  And as I had not provided any reads up to this point and as I am not scum...this was a pretty bad plan...smh.  This ""bad plan"" is probably the main thing I dislike about the slot but I don't want subliminal omgus to cloud my view.  Probably my weakest suspect.

Ircher - It took 22 posts before I saw one with what I would consider any real game related effort and that was a vote on my slot for what appears to be meta reasons associated with 2 players (Titus and Transcend).  So meta squared.  Ugh.  That seems worse than pre-flip associations.  Then when people point out Titus read is based on meta, he produces a completely different set of reasons for suspecting Titus.  All, but pt #5, which were not mentioned when he voted Titus.  So looking for reasons after the fact to help justify read.  Also not sure what his issue is with my role.

BigYoshiFan -  Didn't care for Post 276 when I first read it and in hindsight...still don't.  Not sure how the reasons given warrant a tr.  Same with giving Transcend a tr for replacing out and what I perceived as buttering up to a generally concensus regarded TR (Hiraki).  Stayed on TwoFace quite some time after double voter was confirmed without ever really giving a reason for the 2F vote in the first place...or even mentioning any consideration of the DV.  Then BYF decides transcend is town but maintains a vote on him for 30+ posts.  Only a little over an hour realtime though.  It bugged me more when I first saw it but I'm not sure I see any motivation in it...it's just struck me as odd.  FMPOV...if I'm town and I suspect someone I'm going to vote them because my vote is all I have and I'm judicious with it.  If I decide a scum read is suddenly town...my vote is coming off in the same post.  Or the next one.  I.e. I don't vote or maintain votes on townreads.  It just bugs me that BYF did.  Like his vote being on a tr didn't really matter.

Whemestar - I always think Transcend is scum.  Not intentionally.  And I'm not sure if I have seen his scum game or not to know if there's a difference.  I didn't care for a lot of the reads he threw out.  It felt like he was just throwing them out there to see if any gained traction.  His overreaction to an MMM scum listing seemed too over the top....fake.  And his exit/not exit/exit was just too WIFOMy for me to give any kind of relief for.  And Whemestar hasn't done anything of note since joining either.


So these are my reads as they currently stand.  I think the only people I would actively support being lynched today would be Wheme, BYF and Ircher.

well some people are pushing ircher, some want gamma. some players are inactive and time is also running out.

I'd like to think it's because I made a good point about ending the day already so we can get some damn info. But in reality, it's probably got more to do with the fact that about half the players are inactive, most that aren't think Wheme is scummy, and scum gain from either bussing or mislynching him, so there's little incentive for a counterwagon to start. And if you want to get really technical, Ircher and Gamma are decent counterwagons, given are lack of activity in this game right now.

He quoted a very pro-town post and called the person who made it scum and when he explains why it's scummy, it turns out his reason wasn't accurate
He then added the fact that ircher voted him without any reason but doesn't seem to have an issue with anyone else who did something similar.

I was weighing whether or not Mort was scum - his posting is a bit different than the last game I played with him.  He's reads mostly aligned with mine, so I'm going to treat him as town.  We both don't see Wheme as scum here, you were the closet counterwagon, and I think you're scum.

Your reads don't align with mine and I think you have a pretty yucky ISO that is full of empty questions.

Having similar reads (especially on a replace) is actually a pretty good way to read someone as town, I feel. If you are reading a game and thinking ""this guy's saying all the things I'm thinking"" and you are town, then I think there's a good chance the person you are reading is town. Not to say that scum can't replace in and pick a player to blindly sheep.

I don't care about a Day 1 mislynch; it's almost inevitable for town to do so Day 1 and we can't lynch the guy who I think has the highest chance of being scum right now (fitz), so that makes it even more unlikely.

You see this right here? This isn't helpful. Everybody doesn't remember your lynch pools off the top of their heads. Please just restate it for the ease of everybody so that we've got all the pools clumped together.

@Wheme: You remember that part where I said I don't really care? More or less holds true. I like the top thee wagons that I mentioned earlier  best though, because I think town has a better shot at accuracy this early through consensus.

My Top 3:
1. PenguinPower's slot has always bothered me the most. Might be a tinge of OMGUS there, because it feels like the slot has always been throwing a bit of shade my way.

2. WhemeStar (that's you) have a shaky track record too. Some of the stuff you and your predecessor have pulled seems so blatantly bad that it's hard to imagine it coming from scum. But it's not inconceivable.

3. Gamma Emerald has never fully sit right with me. I feel like even though he's more active than before, it's more as a result of being called out. His activity just feels manufactured to me. But I worry about being subject to early confirmation bias.

Both WhemeStar's and PenguinPower's slots have been eerily consistent over their replacements. I'd expect a little bit more in terms of variance, given that they are different players. Overall, I'm not in love with any of them for a Day 1 lynch, because I prefer fitz. But I acknowledge lynching him without giving him a chance to prove his claim is the height of hubris.",71675,2017-05-12 13:21:00,1516

Is this still the extent of your Gamma read, Tarkus?

This gamestate is awful. I'm not just complaining, I think it's this way for a reason and that reason is not just TF/Titus/Transcend/Fitz fighting. I don't know what the reason is but there is a large set {Tarkus, Ircher, GE, MM4} and you might throw me in there not counting the first few pages and maybe MMM, who are implicitly keeping the gamestate where it is by posting yet having very few game-related interactions. This is scummy and I think there is absolutely scum in this set.

Hikari Link/Kelvin is not scum. I do not like that people are shading them for trying to move the gamestate along. People who have done this are Wheme and Yoshi. Maybe Yoshi should be in the above set too.

I am very hesitant on PP. I think I am always suspicious of PP. PP replaced into a shitshow so I don't blame him for sheeping my reads. How he determined I am worth sheeping? I don't know. This is the main reason I was willing to vote him. But by my hidden metric (which I am working on game by game and which I can't reveal because it can be manipulated) he feels town. Again this is a metric for myself and myself alone and it's not the end all be all of how I read people but it has been very useful in the couple of games I've used it.

Wheme is Wheme. He's probably town.

I will vote anyone in that set above with the exception of Yoshi, MMM, and obviously myself. I don't think I want to vote anyone outside that set other than Fitz.",71675,2017-05-12 22:36:00,1551

I'd rather not lynch fitz today, mainly because of his watcher claim. He'll either prove himself or slowly start digging his grave with that claim, and we'll have a much better judgment of his alignment then.

I want a comprehensive reads list from Gamma. He hasn't done anything recently that invokes a townread from me, and the reasons I've given earlier aren't as important now. From there I will construct a read on Gamma.

PenguinPower is my desired lynch. Everything he's doing doesn't seem genuine. Reads on the basis of whether they agree with his reads or not. His push on Kelvin for his desire to get the day over with despite calling him a top-tier townread, stating that for that reason, his townread on Kelvin is declining, and ending it off in saying that it could be of either alignment. post 1365, post 1386, post 1405

Scum has no stake in the two ""compromise"" lynches (hint they're not compromises) so we are sitting here dicks in our hands until someone dies and we go ""Darn why did we compromise!"" You are letting scum HEAVILY influence who is pressured and who is not.

9593,Kelvin Smith,"
Pretty much. Most towns mislynch, especially Day 1. I'm not gonna lose any sleep if it happens.


If only one of the 3 is scum, then scum don't vote for the compromise that is scum. They can easily hide behind the other options and just say that they think the scum target is town or that they have stronger scumreads. But there should only 3 in a setup of this size, so it's not like they have absolute control over the vote. On top of that, there's plenty of motivation for scum to bus here. I can't speak for anybody else, but I have no problem bussing for towncred Day 1 (or any other day, for that matter). So to say that the leading wagons have virtually no chance of being scum strikes me as a bit narrow-minded.

I'm not saying I want us to mislynch here; quite the opposite. I'm just saying it's just not that likely that we're going to catch scum right now, with our lack of information. And since it's not that likely, I'm not going to be heartbroken if it's a mislynch. You say that scum are happily sitting about and letting this happen? Prove it. Let the mislynch happen and then start analyzing who pushed those lynches, rather than the alternative. Because it's the people with strong feelings right now that are the most worrisome to me. 

It's not like you have to worry about dying tonight, MortFeld. You and I are the obvious Doctor bait right now. Scum would be fools to target us. And a Doctor would be a fool to target anyone but us. And that includes TwoFace. He even said himself that he probably needs to die at some point. Yes, this is a blatant statement to both a Doctor and the Mafia. What are you gonna do about it?",71675,2017-05-13 03:53:00,1591
9594,MarioManiac4,"why are you blaming this gamestate on me
I have posted 78 times; that's more than once every page, and I have never got a prod ever. This gamestate is absolutely not down to ""lack of content"" or whatever; Gamma's been fine, I'm actually solidly townreading Tarkus based on understanding pretty much everything he says about his reads and POV, and it's not Ircher's fault that he is a scumlord.
I have been trying to have interactions. I've been wanting to drop the Wheme wagon- because it's probably on town. I've wanted to do the same with PP and I want to lynch Ircher. The thing is, when I try to get more actions than this (and I stand by that what I am doing is totally fine), I get something like ""well stfu and let me catch up"" or ""shame on you"" and I'm afraid that just immediately kills my motivation to interact MORE with people. Anyway, my activity is fine and I really don't want to have to deal with being shamed for it. Thanks.

This town would rather lynch 1559 than 1573, 1454, and 1392 (which ends up with ""Oh wait lol we have to lynch PP"", and I guess I can't stop that. But I feel like Ircher's ISO speaks for itself. His case on Titus didn't read like analysing whether things meant town/scum, just whether things could be considered scummy. He apparently changed all of his reads from ""willing to compromise"" to ""townreading 80% in the game, must lynch PP."" and coming in to try and tell Mort that lurkers should always be lynched d1 on this site --- what?

5. He didn't self-hammer though, only self-voted. I can see scum using that as a ploy to look like frustrated town. The slot worries me because it has constantly been playing up the frustration angle and it's hard to tell if that's serious or not through text. The fact that it has been consistent over players bothers me a little though.

6a. Why does that make PP scummy? When did he make the case? Can you provide a link? 

6b. What about Ircher seemed scummy before? What made you drop it? Why are you back on him, other than because there is now a wagon on him?

If you are town, I'd advise against claiming VT before you're at L-1 in the future. Helps scum more than town. Honestly, this is another reason why I want a lynch from the current pool.

That's a reasonable stance to take on a Watcher, but a Double Voter is a little different.

That's not even why I'd be fine with a PP lynch.
Lurker lynch d1 isn't that bad (if it's not someone who clearly needs a replacement). PP lynch isn't tht bad. And I assume when he lynched PP he might have seen enough people willing to lynch him that he could get, in his eyes, a good lynch, as opposed to a compromise lynch. I don't think pushing these lynches, on its own, makes him scummy.
This however I do admit is a decent point - I didn't like his Titus case a lot and it's probably the scummiest thing I've seen from him thus far, but in my opinion his other posts outweigh the quality of his Titus case.

This also concerns me - and makes me think there's a decent chance at least one, if not two of the leading wagons (Gamma/Wheme, I assume) are scum, and them/their buddies are shifting onto Ircher, who would be town in this scenario.

I need a good case on Ircher to vote him - and the same goes for anyone outside BYF/PP/Wheme/Gamma for that matter.
I'm fine with lynching both main wagons including Gamma right now since both claimed VT, and at weird times too at that, which if I am right hopefully means that we're likely to lynch scum, and even if we do mislynch it won't be drastic since neither is a power role.",71675,2017-05-13 13:22:00,1628

The issue for me was not that Ircher was saying that lynching lurkers is sometimes viable, nor even that he was potentially setting up for a Ray push.


Ircher's picture of the game is very weird. Actually I'd say it's kind of similar to MM4's. Basically there is a very large group of people in a town pool and the lynch pool is those who are not in the town pool.

But the latter group is pretty arbitrary if that is the criterion. I think in order to even consider lynching Rayfrost you'd need to explain why Greyposting was not town because Grey posted a lot of content. And there are some people missing (me, Wheme, GE, MMM(?)) where the onus is on Ircher to explain why.

So you have Ircher's lynch pool in which neither Wheme nor GE are included, and then this big post by Hikari where they go 'Ok so consensus says Wheme and GE are the lynches now vote one of them' and all Ircher says is 'well hey, lynching lurkers isn't all bad!'

I don't think he's on my team this game.

Also I was like, half shitposting half trying to stir the pot. The people under pressure at that point were like, GE Wheme PP. PP responded in a towny way, GE had been under pressure since fkn RVS and has responded literally the same since then, and Wheme is just a trainwreck regardless of alignment.

Switches to also being okay with a PP lynch. He asked for a case a minute earlier so it's somewhat rash but I can understand that shift to some extent since I also scumread PP at that time.

I can identify with the game being a bit boring/frustrating, and at the time PP's wagon was bigger (which is to say more people were on, they had the same votes if we exclude Ircher), hence I can see how it would be a compromise.

I don't like the townlean on Wheme for this, but it's one nevertheless.

Bla bla this town read is still bad but I can still somewhat see where it's coming from so it's really not as bad as MM4 is making it out to be in my opinion.

Reiterates his point. Pure frustration honestly. That said if he ever flips scum (which I'm still not very convinced if he will) I'll never move my vote off Wheme until he gets lynched.

1) Your first point still fails to parse. You randomly asked me if I'm mafia and quoted that post. What about my assumption does not make sense? If you scumread me for different reasons, why would you quote that post in particular? And this site has a general meta of scumreading people who present viewpoints that are contrary to what you believe even if it isn't alignment-indicative.

2) I townread you and Gamma for early game reasons. I already expressed the reason as to why I would prefer not lynching Wheme. You may have a point about MMM, but I remember having a weak soft townread on them. And, I'm pretty sure RayFrost didn't replace Grey, and I have yet to see anything from Frost that makes me lean town there.

MM4 seems like town.
That said my preferred wagon is still Wheme because I liked Ircher's early content and I think he's more likely to redeem himself, Wheme is just an easier lynch to actually achieve (throwback to Kelvin's original suggestion of lynching Gamma/Wheme), and Wheme is just going to be useless even if kept alive, on top of having claimed VT already, and for no reason.
Yes, it might be possible that I'm tunnelling off my last reads a bit because this day's been strenuous but I'll try keeping an open mind. Ircher, PP and fitz are probably my top lynches for day 2 though. Might lump in Gamma too, but he is gradually seeming less scummy.

This is going to be end up being a wall for all you ""I don't read wall posts"" people. We're probably not going to get along, stylistically. I will attempt to keep things concise. I hope you will attempt to read what I have to say. Don't worry, if you just can't handle reading my posts, I try to include a short-form conclusion at the end. If I don't, just ask for it.

GE's rather reactionary focus in this post bothers me:



When he gets a serious vote, he immediately says he suspects ircher but doesn't follow up with reasons or a vote on him. Then he goes to vote transcend instead, never follows up on this, and later drops both the transcend and ircher reads without ever having made any actual attempt to push them. If you suspect someone, the town thing to do is to pressure them.

Votes with no follow up are just lip service. And this is a consistent issue, which I'll point out a few more times later.



The chain of interaction that comes before this post by Mort is relevant, but Mort raises a good point here: GE is responding to a question about him but not toward him. This is a sign of over-defensiveness and shows another form of reactionary gameplay. 

We see in this post here another case of GE posting suspicions:


But there's no mention of MMM before this, and, if you look at the following posts, there is no followup - no real scumhunting toward MMM to solidify this read or even show why this read exists.

I thought I'd keep going but honestly they're more of the same.

If you go through GE's postings, the votes are rarely outside of what other people are voting, his ""reads"" are either reasonless or could've been super easily copypasted from someone else. Without being questioned or pushed for reasons, GE has not actually given any this entire game. There are more contentless posts than contentful posts, with less content given the less talk about or to him there is.

The willingness to lynch anyone who isn't a townread is inherently a more pro-scum mindset as anyone that isn't scum is a good death. You might also note that GE said he was townreading the fitz slot but then kept his vote and requested a claim. The only motivation to do this is to reveal Fitz's role while it's a free option. If you're town, you push against lynching a townread and try to not get the townread to reveal their role. You don't force them to claim then jump off when you were already townreading the person.

Nothing GE has done this game has been actual scumhunting. It's all lip service and self-serving behavior.

While I understand the transcend wagon's origins and don't completely disagree with it, I personally find transcend's nonsense is inscrutable and that whemestar's existence in this game is too short for me to make a judgment.

True, yes. But the responsibility doesn't lie solely on the poor player. It's the responsibility of better players to draw out quality play from poor players. If they don't, then the good players just as likely to mislynch bad town as they are to lynch bad scum. I believe that putting the onus entirely on weaker players to ""git gud"" is short-sighted and anti-town.


I wasn't particularly planning on it, but I guess I might as well. You're giving me a bad vibe. The things you are saying aren't that different from what other people have said, but they feel much more calculated and predatory.


Yeah, I think it felt like an opportunistic attack on a player that you perceive as an easy target.


Nah, being assertive isn't the issue. It's that the content of your posts feels super sketchy. I mean, it's obviously just my own perspective, but my interaction with Gamma felt pretty genuine and I got a strong feeling of town-mindedness from him. You instead chose to pick on it as only being active when pressured. Admittedly, that was my read on him at first, but seeing his posts now, I just don't see it. My intuition tells me that he's town and you are predatory scum. But I'm grounded enough to know that my intuition can be wrong, so I'd rather that you were watched and everyone be put on their guard, rather than outright lynching you here.

I've seen charismatic scum. I've been charismatic scum. That's what you strike me as right now, so I think it would dangerous to let the town fall into your pace. And I had to say it because with you around, I'm much more worried about dying at night.",71675,2017-05-14 03:28:00,1762

Can you point out the things I've said that are a repeat of something someone else has said? 



Okay. How is he an easy target? What about this is favorable to me over taking the easy path of pushing the current highest wagon (the one on whemestar) to completion? Several people have expressed town-reads on Gamma Emerald, there have been almost no people that actually oppose the whemestar lynch so much as preferring a different one.



What about my posting makes you think my charismatic nature is indicative of me being scum rather than town? Or is my charisma completely separate and just a fact that accompanies your belief that I'm scum?

Are you saying that you thought the same things I did and then changed your mind seeing his responses after what I posted?

And why would my being in the game make you feel worried about dying at night? You've been overly focused on the night phase and the shots that are going to go down and trying to control what happens there. Just stop. Every post you make about this does nothing to serve the town. It is incredibly anti-town to be vocally expressing your thoughts re: the night game as it gives more information to the informed minority (scum) than it does to the uninformed majority (town).",71675,2017-05-14 08:32:00,1771

9779,Kelvin Smith,"Spoiler: @Ray 
Sure, I guess I'll look into that for you. Didn't feel particularly new though. I feel like I said some of those things myself earlier in the game, but maybe I just thought them.


Because if Gamma's town and you're scum, he's got more going for him that could be exploited than Wheme and Transcend. There has always been a lingering shadow of doubt over that slot. On top of which, Wheme is pretty much a done deal. You can let it happen without having to be on a mislynch if Wheme is town. And you'd even be able to get some towncred for trying to push a counterwagon. Plus, because of the negative sentiment towards Wheme, even if you made a Gamma lynch happen today, you could easily get a Wheme lynch to happen tomorrow. As scum you'd have so many options here that I don't even know why you feel the need ask how this is favorable, other than in hopes that I won't think of the various reasons this is a good move for you as scum.


It's not that your charisma is indicative of you being town rather than scum. It's that your charisma makes it much easier for you as scum to lead the charge on mislynches. And as a charismatic player, you are much less likely to be detected as scum, which is why you are somebody I'm wary of.

I'm not sure what you mean by this question. I think you're asking me when I thought the things you thought. I thought them when Gamma was one of my top scumreads. He was very reactive and otherwise not very involved. My most recent interaction with him changed my mind though, which I believe happened before you posted your case.

I'll have to disagree with you on that one. I prefer to WIFOM the Mafia so that they second-guess their decisions during the Night. And I tend to think that it's better for the town to be cognizant of the fact that regardless of whether or not they are a PR, they can exert some level of control over he Night with their words and actions during the Day.",71675,2017-05-14 08:53:00,1777

See, you're argument here isn't unfair or entirely incorrect. But it's more that we disagree and I feel that you should know better. Like, the case isn't bad, per se, but I feel like there are extenuating circumstances to consider. I see the way you talk, act, and present your cases and it reminds me of me. I'm terrified of playing against a player like me because I have an overly high opinion of myself. It's actually kind of a compliment, in a weird way. 

As a result, I tend to become automatically suspicious that players like you are trying to pull a fast one on me. I don't think it's ever happened yet, but I'm scared it will happen one day. I'm admittedly not completely rational as a result of these feelings. If you aren't confirmed town and we make it to LyLo together, I'll probably be even more suspicious of you. But I'll probably end up siding with you, because I won't let paranoia be my ultimate decision maker. For right now though, it's early enough in the game that I'm willing to let my paranoia exercise control of my decisions.


No, I know. But it can be hard for scum to get it out of their heads. And, in some ways, I feel like what I do gives PRs more freedom. By saying ""Doc is probably going to protect these people,"" it may give scum pause to not take out the most useful people. And the protective players might then want to consider focusing elsewhere. It's almost like having two layers of protection. Of course, saying this now, scum may be more inclined to strike pro-town players. Which may make protective people more likely to protect them.

What do you find bad about this post?


I don't know if I'd say it's a misrep, but it's a gross oversimplification of my earlier stance and it ignores any of the recent stances that I've taken, so it's still not a great post.


It's really not. A town flip is still better than two living townies, because it gives us data to work with. You've given us relatively little to work with and my expectations aren't high. Sorry, but I've literally seen you as conftown sit around and do nothing to help find the last scum. And while you're alive, you hinder our ability to utilize the Double Voter for better wagons. Mislynching you if you're town certainly isn't ideal, but it's not the worst thing that can happen or even a particularly bad thing.",71675,2017-05-14 21:29:00,1811

I can't really answer that until it happens, since nothing happens in a vacuum. We have to consider the circumstances around the lynch, we have to consider who supported the lynch, we have to consider who opposed the lynch, and we have to consider the types of interactions you had.

Even just quotes are still something to look at, if he flips town. It's good to know who town suspect and why. Even if their thinking is faulty, it might trigger something. And if he's scum, then maybe there is something to parse from it too. Either way, words from him are worth more to us than silence.

As for whether or not I think he's town, I could go either way. At times he feels like indifferent town, sometimes like flailing town, and other times like flailing scum.

That's not even an accurate representation of the situation. Mort and Gamma clearly don't want to lynch you. You're not Ray's first choice. Tarkus didn't scumread you, I don't think.

No, they were prodded. 

That's because you keep going back and forth. 

Look, I really don't think Ircher is a good lynch right now. We'd need to get him to L-1 and then he'd need to claim. And if his claim was a PR, we'd just have to all quickly switch back to Wheme (which, if he's scum, he'd definitely do at this point). So he's ultimately not going to end up lynched and if he's town, only scum stand to benefit.

If it's a scum-driven wagon, then I'd say he's more likely to be town.


That's because there are a lot of factors at play here and ""might actually be scum"" isn't good enough. Townread or not, I really think you should consider the possibility that Wheme is scum and consider the consequences of an Ircher wagon if Ircher is town.

My issue with anyone town reading wheme is yo literally have nothing game related to use for town reading him. He has done nothing to help find scum, he's provided no reasons for his scum reads, he's basically done jack squat.

There was a game where town had 1 mislynch left. I was dead set on lynching somebody but that person took the time and energy making a case on somebody else. The case was good enough I actually decided to go with that instead and if it was wrong, I could lynch him the next day. He was right and that was the last scum.

I didn't know. Only strongly suspected. I wasn't sure if he was a full Watcher, because I'm not a full Cop. He could've had a limited number of watches in him or been Even-Day or something. Recently finished a game with Even-Night and Odd-Night Roleblockers on the Mafia side, so I thought it was possible that something similar was going on for the Town side. Figured it would be the best bet to confirm my suspicions and see if he tried to give up one of his partners when he gave us results.


I have no result. I'm an Odd-Night Cop. I had this whole multi-stage claim set up in case there was a Roleblocker, but he's dead now, so it's unneeded. I'll explain the steps of my claim in my next post. I was really proud of how I breadcrumbed it.


I'm planning to stick around the site on the social side of things once my semester ends, so I won't be completely gone, hopefully.",71675,2017-05-21 19:46:00,2022
10025,Kelvin Smith,"Spoiler: My Breadcrumbs 



I was originally intending to vote the 11th player on the list on post #9 to indicate 911 (the US emergency services number, for those who are from outside the country). But then Yoshi stole my post, so I had to pivot to something else. I decided to breadcrumb with the first letter of the first word of the first sentence of my first post, the second word of the second sentence of my second post, and the third word of the third sentence of my third post. Technically, Vote was the first letter of my first sentence, but I decided to just run with it, since it was close enough and sufficiently subtle that I wouldn't be caught.

I anticipated that I might have to reveal my breadcrumb at several stages in the game, so I didn't leave any clues other clues in my first post, but I always had plans for my second and third post. The initial claim was supposed to be Full Cop Day 2, that way I could draw protective roles to me and get a potential roleblock on me Night 2 (when I couldn't do anything anyway). 

Day 3 I was supposed to point to my second post and say that I was breadcrumbing that I was a One-Shot Cop, that way scum wouldn't bother to Roleblock me Night 3. I was still going to argue for protection though, with the assertion that my claim makes me essentially confirmed town and so I'd be valuable to keep around.

Day 4, I was supposed to reveal my results and let everybody know I had been an Odd-Night Cop the whole time. My third post was meant to be the final hint, which is why I specifically said ""every other,"" to indicate that I could use my effect every other night. But then the Roleblocker got lynched and the necessity of that plan went out the window. And since I'm replacing out anyway, I thought it would be better to reveal my breadcrumb now, that way people could see why this isn't just a fakeclaim, but a plan that has been in the making since the beginning.

Also, one of the reasons I was trying to rush through Day 1 was because I just wanted to Cop fitz already, since I felt really good about him as scum.",71675,2017-05-21 20:09:00,2023

10029,Ircher,"Disclaimer before MM4 accuses me of changing reads on a whim: I read through some of the ISIOs while compiling this.

Spoiler: Reads Confirmed Town (From my perspective) (98%-100% Confidence)
IrcherÂ  (100%) - Role PM
Kelvin Smith (99%) - I've liked him throughout the game, and his Cop claim on scum cements his town status.

Likely Town (85%-97% Confidence)

Leaning Town (60%-84% Confidence)

Null (0% - 30% Confidence; No/Very Weak Read)

Neutral (31%-59% Confidence; Mixed Read)
Gamma (+41%) - 107 and 115 were the basis of my early townread here. Mainly because of the fact that his reads were consistent, and he responded pretty well to pressure. My ""serious"" vote early in the game on Gamma was mainly because of 235, but I later realized that post is really null-indicative. (I was being silly I guess...) I like his response to Mort in 259. The somewhat-a-contradiction between 876 and 893 pings a little bit, but in the end, it doesn't affect my read that much. Not sure why he claimed in 1608.... I guess he's just frustrated. (Not sure what to make of that....) Just the way he posts makes it hard to get a strong read here.

MMM (+38%) - 63 really has the wrong feel. 379 actually has good vibes to it. 610 makes his push on Transcend look really bad.... 699--why would you park your vote on someone who you are quite obviously biased against because of the insults he sent yor way? I honestly can't see how such is town-motivated. (Caveat: Anti-town, not scummy.) 1254 has a good, laidback feel to it. 1329 was a decent lynch pool at the time of the post (though I disagree with lynching Yoshi at the time.) 1658 is a good post (and not just because I'm biased.) This one is a mixed bag -- seems to alternate between good and bad posting....

Tarkus (+34%) - 356 feels like a good post. 953 is bad but not really alignment indicative. (The Fitz wagon was not a Policy Lynch.) A few good posts, not too many bad posts, but honestly, I kinda want more from this slot.

Paul/Grey/RayFrost (+31%) - Don't like 554; 5 pages in is more than enough to make a catch up post if you're that many pages behind. 562 is just weird. 670 really catches my attention as Grey tries to push a derp thing from Paul as a townslip. Posts like 594 are just annoying fluff. 615 would've been fine if there wasn't the ""probably"" at the end. 645 is a bad joke. 651 is fine I guess. Lots of Ray's early posts are excuses as to why he cannot catch up, but I'm not questioning their legitimacy right now. Disagree with 716, but it's probably the first town post I've really seen from the slot. Kinda like Ray's posting though...

Mario (-31%) - Kinda weird not to have scumreads by (post]288[/post]. The lack of any kind of scumreads by 692 is a bit alarming, but understandable -- most of the players in the game feel town. 922 is a good post. 1079 is kinda meh. 1153 is false as there was quite a few counters to Wheme. 1162 feels too dismissive. Alas, 1209 being true seems to be a thing on this site. 1592: ""I have posted 78 times"" -- Maybe 15 of them are actually useful? Number of posts doesn't matter quite as much as what's in it. Not sure what to make of the ""It's not Ircher's fault that he is a Scumlord"" comment. 1630 is a misrep of my stances. Nothing in 1649 show me stating that Penguin was mod!conf scum. It showed that I thought Penguin was the best lynch out of the lynches I considered viable. 1651 is biased misinterpretation. Not sure what made you think 1655 but to clarify, what you ruled out is more as to what I meant. (Perhaps my statement was ambiguous to some extent, but your flat out refusal to accept my explanation is obnoxious.) 1683 and 1690 are decent posts. 2010 is a good post (as well as the earlier vote.)

Delbird/Penguin (-42%) - 140 really doesn't read right. What's to say town cannot be confident? Like, I feel you need more than just that. Don't like 1293 and 1297's assertion that Mort's lack of analysis is alignment indicative. It COULD BE indicative, but is it indicative or is Penguin just trying to find a reason to scumread Mort? 1390 feels like he was trying to warp the argument to something else. Don't get what Penguin is suggesting in 1466 tbh. I would like to note for Mario's sake that I have no where near a strong scumread on this slot. That said, I do have a scumread here currently.

Leaning Scum (60%-75% Confidence)

Likely Scum (76%-100% Confidence)

Spoiler: How to read this readslist Players are placed in different sections based on my confidence in the read expressed as a percentage. A positive percentage indicates that I leans towards town on a player whereas a negative percentage indicates I lean towards scum on a player. Please note that the Null an Neutral sections contain both townreads and scumreads and you must look a the sign of the percentage in parenthesis to determine which way I lean.

Confidence ratings are rough estimates and are relative to one another. In addition, they tend to be scored on a logarithmic scale versus a linear scale; in other words, the difference between 0% and 30% tends to be greater than ther difference between 30% and 60%.

Also, this readslist is from a template I have, and it is from my perspective. There is no reason to scumread me just for including myself in my readslists as it is a stylistic issue versus an alignment indicative issue.

You're not wrong. It's pretty fence-sitty. But at the same time, he doesn't have a huge amount to go off of. Our Day 1 lynch wasn't ideal (we can probably try to glean some info, if we analyze it, but we could use more). The Night 1 death was on a pretty town player, so there isn't much room for speculation there. Day 2 pretty much didn't exist and there's not anything to glean off of people sheeping a Cop claim. Night 2 was again a pretty clear town player, so there's still not anything to speculate on.

10048,Priscila,"I prefer to go over on the early game now, starting from RVS. I'll progress to later in the game and get current over the next day or two as I have time. I may jump back and forth a little to address thoughts on most recent events as I need to.

Spoiler:  When I see this I don't know if this is Titus feeling nonplussed because it's her bud or because she is simply being awkward. This line is also somewhat awkward from MMM, not because the internal logic seems inconsistent but because coming out with such an elaborate reason for an RVS vote feels strange to me. It's followed up by this:
Which again feels slightly overdone and just a little awkward. If he was referring to normal game, perhaps it would be more fitting, but this seems strangely specific for the context. Still, this is a very minor thing.

They both are absent for the thread for a little after this, until a post by MMM:
Which feels a little disjointed to me - his vote on Titus was RVS and yet he is now genuinely suspecting her as scum? Maybe he is just making severe judgments from only a little content, but he seems a bit lurky and this post feels like an empty way to display scumhunting.

I feel slightly better about his immediately follow-up:But then this again feels a little staged to me:

This confidence here to have caught two scum at this point is bothering me a little, because unless this is a personality thing of overconfidence the assumption that he has caught two scum doesn't feel super villagery. I'll be noting it for the future. My unease somewhat lessened by the fact that I was also suspecting Titus and BYF at this point.

This is something that I like more from MMM, and being able to articulate his reasoning definitely assuages some of the ill feelings I was having up to this point.

Overall feelings from MMM coming out of RVS are a little bit of worry about his awkwardness and his lack of active engagement of other players, but I get enough of a look that he is sorting players despite not interacting with them to feel okay about him. I think his general approach to RVS is fairly villagery.",71675,2017-05-21 23:33:00,2046

Working on an exam right now, so I can't go over what you said, but your reads are basically the safest reads possible, with the exception of PP. Gamma is one of the most scumread people in the game right now and your other three in the next tier have generally seen similar levels of heat as each other. So you've basically got a read list that allows you to pivot to any of the prime lynch candidates, at least half of which mathematically must be mislynches.

His thread presence following from that feels overall pretty shallow and forced, and I don't get the feeling at all that he is really sorting players. This feels strongly like scum using RVS to blend in, not town using RVS to sort.

His exit from RVS deepens my suspicious about him. This feels completely like fake scumhunting. He has not done anything to truly sort MM4, and I do not see anything from MM4 that is meaningfully indicative of any alignment. His qualification of the vote as ""semi-serious"" strikes me as posturing and hesistance to truly leave RVS and push on anything, and his interaction with Transcend immediately afterwards tells me that is not really interested in where his vote is placed and is still trying to blend in and would prefer to keep the game in a more ""social"" state. I feel that he is not really sure how to respond to Transcend calling him scum so early, and his continued interaction with him over the next two pages feels very much like an awkward attempt to seem to have been scumhunting - he comments only in an abstract way and none of it feels real.",71675,2017-05-21 23:51:00,2054
10057,Priscila,"Okay, that makes sense. Let me explain a little. Gamma and Titus/fitz were my only two strong scumreads from the start of the game to present when I was doing a quick catchup read after subbing in. I feel sure that the last scum is in my scumleans and those are the slots I am most focused on sorting. Ideally I will be able to eliminate at least one of those over the course of the day today, and narrow my lynch pool down to 2 players after Gamma. I feel very good about Gamma being scum right now and that is the lynch that I want today, I am very unwilling to lynch anywhere else.",71675,2017-05-21 23:54:00,2055

I felt he was being very relaxed and humorous then suddenly he gives hard reads like that, the switch in tone is definitely notable. He then moves to shade Mortfeld, which again is out of place and feels defensive in a scummy way - I feel that town would recognize this as natural scumhunting and engage with it, scum would feel threatened and want to shut it down. The thought process from 36 to 45 does not add up to me.

On a purely intellectual level, then yes, they know who is who and arguably can't have true thoughts on the matter. But I think that somebody with sufficient levels of empathy can place themselves into the mindset of a town person and come up with reads that are essentially indistinguishable from town reads.

But having read Grey's content strongly as scum I suppose I'm less inclined to glaze over and hand out a townread for it, and I'm now noticing how one-dimensional the attack is. All of Ray's reads are oriented around his Gamma scumread. There's no nuance to it. He dislikes the Ircher wagon because Gamma is on it. He finds MM4 scummy because of how he has treated the Gamma wagon. I'm also noticing how superficially aggressive the push is. He shotguns out a bunch of accusations and questions that don't really lead anywhere, he doesn't follow them up. It feels fake.

Ircher's response to the content is not particularly excellent, either. He offers only a brief comment and does nothing to engage, displays no paranoia at all. Compare Mortfeld's confused response and Kelvin's doubtful one.",71675,2017-05-23 10:09:00,2142

10150,Priscila,"Infighting is a guess. The way that Titus replaced out was very sudden, she was being wagoned and there were definitely scum on her wagon - I haven't gotten to that part of my analysis of the game yet. If Titus didn't get along with her buds in the pregame chat and was unhappy with how they were playing, I could see that as spurring her to replace out.
Ircher is my prime suspect for the busser because of the sudden way that he came out with a Titus case once Transcend started saying that Titus was scum. I felt that his attack lacked nuance, that he didn't really follow it up and that he didn't treat the claim with the kind of skepticism I would expect of someone who is very strongly convinced that someone is scum the way that Ircher seemed to be. From what I remember, he only stated blandly that a watcher was entirely possible as a scum role. He didn't engage with the claim really at all, and aside from that he didn't engage with Titus or fitz and develop his push in a villagery way.",71675,2017-05-23 10:45:00,2148

10152,Priscila,Hi.,71675,2017-05-23 10:48:00,2150
10153,RayFrost,"I'd like to start by going ahead with this: Vote: BigYoshiFan

I'd like to state that I currently have a townread on Gamma. And I never really had a scumread on him. His reaction to my accusations on day 1 was quite towny (which brought him from null to town), and the reactions of other players around those accusations were more suspect. My main motivation for pushing him was that I had felt it was highly unlikely a wagon would actually shift to him (I didn't want more claims, really) and it was highly likely people would be willing to discuss it (other pushes felt less likely to get any substance from the others). Sorry to Gamma. You were a good choice for this. Nothing personal.

Now, the reactions of two players in particular bothered me: Ircher and BigYoshiFan. I'm fine with voting either one this game phase. I'd need to go back through to link to specific posts for BigYoshiFan, but here's the basic breakdown for both reads:

BigYoshiFan - his ~scumread~ on titus and his reactions around her were very much of the omgus variety in that it could be boiled down to ""titus' reasoning for suspecting me is bad so titus is suspect"" - his suspicion of titus is artificial at best and is a reaction, not individually spawned. This can be seen by his reaction to people townreading the titus slot as well. 

A lot of BigYoshiFan's sources of suspicion can be summed up with ""what this person did didn't feel genuine"" - there's no way to really poke at this reasoning. And it's not wrong in and of itself. But when it's the reason for most of your reads, it becomes an excuse rather than a reason. He also puts mild efforts to express a townread of Ircher in reaction to people suspecting him. Mind you, associative tells before a flip aren't the best to go off of, but it's a point for why ircher's number two.

Additionally, his reaction to my case against Gamma was ""I promise more later, but it's intriguing"" with nothing given later. Intriguing and interesting are two words with very similar uses: you say them and it can mean anything you want. Also note BigYoshiFan never shows any suspicion of Gamma prior to or after that post.

Ircher - Associative tells with BigYoshiFan are the main reason, to be honest. If you look through their interactions and the flow of their reads, there's a lot of them matching up in reads / supporting each other's cases and not a lot of actual direct interaction between them. It's indirect. Agreement, with little conflict of reads (or apparently not enough to converse with each other about their differences for some reason).

The stuff from today that has been mentioned could be included as well, but that's been covered.

I'd also like to make a premature claim because I can. I'm a two shot gunsmith, and I've used both shots on players that I couldn't get a good read on. One is MarioManiac4, the other is Penguin Power. Neither of them have guns. I'm making this claim now because the playerlist is small enough that having these results (especially since I can't get any more) out is beneficial given we don't know how many members of the scumteam there are. If you are a role with limited shots that is investigative and you've used them, I would suggest claiming now.",71675,2017-05-23 10:53:00,2151

I'm not for or against thr massclaim tbh. I have mixed feelings. So far we have an odd-night cop, doublevoter, and 2-shot gunsmith for town, and two-shot roleblocker for scum. Scum's target for this night is probably obvious unless they suspect a town protective, so any other town claim would likely be safe for a night unless they are town protective. But, if someone does claim town PR that is not protective, then there's much less of a threat of town protective to scum. I dunno, that's where my head is at.",71675,2017-05-23 17:09:00,2177

It's completely outside the bounds of playing within the game to be asking about the precise phrasing of moderator given information in any standard game, and I very much dislike your attempts at doing so for reasons that I could go into but they're not game related and this debate probably would not be healthy to the game state.",71675,2017-05-24 10:59:00,2254

Lean-town.

There were some things I didn't like regarding you.



Here, it felt like you were playing the innocent and naive card.

Your surprising attention to detail during RVS threw me off, but your catchup later pretty much nullifies this.
I didn't particularly like your townread on me for ""keeping the peace"" per se, because it seemed like a pretty shallow read and I'd probably do it whether I was scum or not, because conflicts like that don't create a fun or cormfortable atmosphere.

But there were more important things I did like.

You point out things from an objective perspective; you have both positive and negative things about each player, which makes me comfortable because doesn't feel like you're trying to force out reads. You're attention to possible partners and busses, and that they're reasonable and original reads, give me town vibes. And overall, and I think I'm stealing your words here, but it feels like an organic thought process.",71675,2017-05-25 00:31:00,2290

1. Because it seems like you're saying in any circumstance where you come out with a tier list and a vote, people can't call it opportunistic. I sure think you can. Your join date is quite recent, and the tone, especially when you say ""genuinely"" didn't rub me the right way.
2. The emphasis I was intending was not that it had attention to detail, but that it was regarding RVS, if that makes sense. Asserting reads largely based on RVS and the early game, as it seemed like that when I had comforted you on this, isn't very helpful. 
3. What I mean by this is that you begin to incorporate the other parts of the game into your reads. 
4. I am nitpicking. I'm just mentioning it because it is something that I didn't like and it specifically pertained to your read on me. I was expecting from this; however, a little more.... analysis? Like, maybe some of your thoughts on how I interpreted your read on me. Your response to this in particular seems quite defensive and I'm not sure I like it.

10367,MMM,"
Actually, I can answer my own question - I realised earlier that Gunsmith would get guilty on the Cop and JK. However, assuming that Ray's claim is true, I still think that Mafia Doctor would make sense since I feel like we would have way too much power otherwise considering we have two inspecting roles and a Jailkeeper on top of that.
Obviously that is false if your speculation that scum has a Rolecop is accurate - a Mafia Doctor on top of that would become too scumsided. However, how sure are you that there is a Mafia Rolecop? I feel like Roleblocker should do the job on its own there and Godfather/Doctor would make more sense here, in particular Doctor so that there are two roles messing with the Gunsmith's investigations - one giving a false negative, and one giving a false positive.
I'll have a look at the games you linked whenever I get round to posting things about Mario/Yoshi/Ray btw.

MMM is my strongest read for town there and Gamma is Ray's strongest read for town, which means that even if I am wrong on MMM or Gamma, it is most likely that BYF is partners with 1 of them.

Because you all had already agreed (for the most part) that we should massclaim.

Also because I honestly didn't evaluate the usefulness of massclaim today really. (Kind of a in-the-heat-of-the-moment thing.)

The main reason why I said I don't think massclaim today was the best idea is because town is in no danger of LyLo atm and with the people who already claimed, massclaim basically just outs the unclaimed protective if any.

I guess I can't blame you for the massclaim as I didn't protest like you commented. I'm just saying that in retrospect, massclaiming wasn't quite as good of an idea as it may have seemed.

10396,MMM,"This looks plausible to me.

Yoshi sniped me to this too I think but Mafia probably expected a protective role to be on Kelvin, and it seems that they were correct in assuming that.

I actually did think that was what you meant. Upon rereading the post I now realise that you did mean it in a different way than I had thought, so my bad there I guess.

1. Again, it was gonna be a starting point for me to start sorting people had day not ended prematurely. Given that 1 of the people in that pool flipped scum, and 4/5 people in that pool are good lynch candidates atm, I think that is still a really good pool as well. (I'm not treating the GS inspects as locktown unless Ray actually flips since I'm sceptical of the claim for reasons I have outlined and even if he flips GS, Mafia Doctor is still a possibility meaning that one, but not two of his innos could be scum)
2. I'd want to call myself town as either alignment. Do think about it though - if he didn't have accurate reads, why would he be killed over Kelvin at the time? On Night 1, there would unlikely be any drawback to killing him, and basically everyone thought he was town, whereas 1-2 people expressed concerns over Mort (if I remember correctly, I might be wrong), and on top of that Kelvin was a PR and Mort wasn't, though I don't know how much scum knew about their roles at the time.

Weird, I remember Gunsmith getting a gun result on JK. If that is the case though it makes a bit more sense if it was included, as 2 town roles giving a false positive would be just a bit too much.

It isn't an auto win plan if we only have 2 confirmed town.

I'm honestly not a big fan of ISOing people these days. The lack of context hurts it to a degree. But since you asked, I'll do it later.

Ircher is really hard to confirm now, though if his claim is legit, he's likely to die Night 3 or 4, depending on how scum want to play this. If they kill him Night 3, then I'll get a result. On the other hand, if they kill me, then they might have their kill stopped Night 4.

Honestly, I wouldn't mind lynching Ray today to confirm his results. Also because I just generally have no trust for him. But that's probably paranoia speaking, so I think I won't act upon it.

I could also see my way towards lynching someone other than Ray. There are few enough PRs with limited enough abilities that I think that all present claims could be legitimate.

If all claims are legitimate, I don't feel like the Mafia are extremely likely to have a role that bypasses Cop or Gunsmith. The entire town PR lineup is super restricted here. We've all got limiting modifiers that make synchronization difficult. I find it hard to believe that the Mafia also have ways to bypass our already limited investigative abilities. I'm not saying it's impossible (and I'm certainly open to counterarguments), it just feels very unlikely to me.

@Everyone: If there are still unclaimed PRs, now is probably the time to say something. Unless you are a protective role, then maybe don't say shit.

Assuming that nobody else claims, as much as I'd like to distrust Ray, I'm going to assume that all of the information is correct and only lynch in the pool of people who haven't claimed a PR and aren't cleared by Ray.",71675,2017-05-29 05:36:00,2457

I have unfortunately been busy with other games and with real life so I have not yet had time to fully flesh out my reads, but I am also somewhat waiting for Ray to talk to him about what he sees in Gamma.

At the moment, I am strongly considering that I may have tunneled on early game and surface scummy play to arrive at a scum read on Gamma. I wrote off his burst of activity midway through day 1 as fake because he had been talking about apathy, but perhaps that was a mistake of me. So my reads are somewhat fluid still and I hesitate to give a tierlist for that reason. Read that as posturing if you will, but I simply haven't yet dedicated the time yet to this game that it needs for me to solidify my reads after the mass claim.

Because a counterclaim is a 1-for-1 trade that arguably gives scum more information than town.

10473,MMM,"Welcome back Kelvin.
Whose claim is it that you found fishy?

I have to admit I thought about that for a bit, but I didn't want to discuss that before I was done with my reread and had everyone more or less sorted.

Given that a d3 massclaim could have resulted in not 2 but 3 innocent inspects along with the 2 investigative roles being possible confirmed innocents, under the assumption that both inspecting claims are indeed town, I don't actually believe it to be that unlikely that scum has one role that can bypass Gunsmith (this doesn't go for Cop, since Mafia Godfather is apparently not Normal) - again under the assumption that both inspecting roles are town.

I've been pretty open with my reads the whole game. As for who I'm lynching today I'll get that figured out once I finish my reread.

I have considered that, actually, but I never said anything about it since having thought for it for a bit hard bussing the roleblocker would have honestly been pretty fucking stupid.",71675,2017-05-29 10:14:00,2471

10475,Kelvin Smith,"
It was Ray's. Before the massclaim was done, I thought it was suspect that we'd have two investigative roles and a protective role. And I thought it was convenient that he'd blow his load in the first two Nights and come back with no guilty results. But that was just based on an initial glance. I need to look deeper. He also may have been the one to call for it (haven't checked back to see yet) and that bothered me. At the time, the massclaim struck me as more likely to be scum-led.


That's what makes it so goddamn diabolical. You might not know this about me, but I have no problems bussing my teammates whatsoever. The only real risk I'd run is a counterclaim.",71675,2017-05-29 10:24:00,2473

10478,RayFrost,"

While this isn't a correct assessment, there's other reasons that your claim is believable.

Let's assume you are scum for a moment and think about what you did:
You claimed cop in a game where you wouldn't know for sure if there was a cop, to claim a guilty on your scumbuddy who had ""gotten away"" with a watcher claim (meaning no counterclaim) and was about to be lynched in all likelihood due to the scumminess of their play.

So you prematurely fakeclaimed, with minimal information, in order to... do what? You were already townread. This just increased your risk for no actual gain.",71675,2017-05-29 10:30:00,2476

Okay, that's fair enough. Like I said, I couldn't remember who initiated it. Not that it matters. I don't necessarily think it was that bad anymore. Though that might just be hindsight.

Alright here we go, I'm gonna hardcore analyze this.


Spoiler:  I disliked Titus for not explaining her reasons for scumreading me, not that I disliked her reasons for scumreading me.


My vote was not an OMGUS either. Until 530, I couldn't really tell what her read on me was, and if you think it was evident she was scumreading me, explain. Before 530 I already expressed suspicion and a scumread.


Also, I don't think Titus was a generally townread slot like you claim. Can you show me evidence of this?

Spoiler:  Here's every time I mention the word ""genuine."" 





You claim that by using it to make reads I've left no room for argument, but I've explained why each of those things doesn't come out as genuine to me and left room for argument in that, except 670. People have argued with me over these reads too.




Also in response to 763.

In response to 1557.

You're also claiming that this is the reason for most of my reads. Here's other reasons I've made for reads that aren't in regards to how genuine people are.









More stuff on Titus I wanted to include.

If you remove the paragraph in which I mentioned PP's genuinity, the rest is fine.



There are some reads I've made after this post that don't involve how genuine someone is too.





Not denying that I never responded. Never got around to it. No objections to anything here. If you'd like to engage me with anything said here, be my guest. It probably doesn't look very good that I started showing suspicion of Gamma after this either, but I am scumreading him now.

Nothing to say about Ircher, but if you want to engage me involving him, again, be my guest. This probably doesn't matter as much now that Ircher has claimed.

I'm really trying to analyze the claim here. I didn't see a reason to deny it at first, but among other claims, it's the least believable and potentially the most harmful. Up until this point, we knew Kelvin's, TwoFace's, and fitz's roles. Ircher did not claim yet. Thinking this is scum, I'm trying to find where he found the need to make a fakeclaim and a measure of the risk and reward he gets here. If he's town, he's fully justified claiming here. If he's scum, does he include his partner in his results and risk them being lynched if he, himself is determined to be scum? How likely did he think his claim was to be believed? Why did he feel the need to fakeclaim? How do his posts reflect upon this claim, both before and after? I'm just throwing these questions out to maybe promote discussion here. This claim is really boggling me. Perhaps this shouldn't be the focus for now, but I'm far from completely faithful to this claim, and it's had a huge toll on people's reads.",71675,2017-05-30 00:21:00,2503

10508,Priscila,"Because of your style of posting, I think you go more deeply into things than others.

Ray's claim was not believable to me at the time because I felt that it was a low-risk fakeclaim that he could ride to a win if people accepted it, and it came after I expressed a scum read on him. That is why I pushed for the massclaim. Knowing the full setup, it would be possible to prove his claim as fake. But having seen the possibilities, I think that without a gunsmith here that town is too weak, if scum had a roleblocker and a rolecop. And if you look at our situation, I think you will quickly realize that the massclaim was completely protown. This is why I asked you to read my iso.",71675,2017-05-30 00:45:00,2506

Good morning, bit of time before work.

Incorrect assumption.

Just because there was one mafia roleblocker doesn't mean there can't be two, both with limited power, or that you're ascetic. And I made my post literally a minute after I logged in and saw my investigation result, so I didn't have time to think about which was more likely to be the case. I still haven't had time to do so.

And until I do, I'd appreciate it if you bozos would hold off on the voting. We're not quite in a game position where if there's two mafia we lose from quicklynching, but let's avoid another day cut short.

Are you a real person who's really saying this

It took me [ur=https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=68243&p=8356095&hilit=+3+shot+#p8356095]about a minute[/url] to find a 3-shot gunsmith in a mini normal that ended as recently as last September. So let's just nix that entire concept of ""it's one more than 2 so it's insanity and has never been done!"" Which was silly to begin with.

I am not a big fan of setup speculation as a general rule to determine scumhunting without extensive experience with the moderators in question due in no small part to the fact that people's ideas about the balance shifts between x and y tend to not be exactly the same. For example, from my perspective, a two-shot roleblocker and an odd/even roleblocker wouldn't be so outlandish as to not be worth considering. From your perspective, it's Madness! Our ideas are different.

Note that I haven't just voted anyone. This is because I have to both review my reads this game, given the town flip on BYF, and also that I need to determine if there's anything that can be determined by my lack of result. I haven't thought of or considered all the possible role interactions at this time, so yeah.

anyway- my point stands that unless i am being stupid and missing something major the only way you are town is if priscila is a mafia ascetic. obviously town roleblocker/scum rb could go together in some fashion. but roleblocker is a very powerful role in scum hands. two scum roleblockers would make about as much sense as a flying camel in this setup.",71675,2017-06-03 11:25:00,2597

That said, you don't look as bad as PP does for that in my opinion.

Same.

I had thought this at first, but I decided to wait for whether you were gonna post the same thing or not, and now it's just pure WIFOM. T__T

Under the assumption that Priscila is a VT and Ray is indeed a 3-shot GS, then the no result could have only come from an unclaimed town roleblocker/jailkeeper (which would make this setup ridiculously townsided unless scum has ridiculous power as well, and would also mean they should fucking claim), or something ridiculous like a second Mafia 2-Shot Roleblocker/Jailkeeper (which would be... yeah, ridiculous). Unless you think that either of these are the case, we have confirmed scum among the two of them, and if we believe that that is the case, I will most likely be voting Ray today.
I don't like the last sentence of that post, but I agree with it otherwise.

Shrug.

I'd like a bit of respect about me not being dumb.

Yet I still can't see Priscila as scum. Not only would that mean Tarkus was scum but in order for the investigation to be correct Priscila would have to be Ascetic and considering the RB that's just way too unlikely.

10618,MarioManiac4,"Alright.
There are 7 players alive. {MM4, PP, Ircher, Priscila, MMM, RayFrost, Gamma}
Realistic pool is more like {PP, MMM} for me.
Ircher is JK (prob a full one) and his claim #works 
Priscila genuinely seems to be scumhunting and Tarkus was obvtown.
Town is too underpowered without RF+ no scum motivation to do what he did.
Gamma feels kinda town although there admittedly is a chance he's actually scum.
PP was inno'd by RF but his hammer was shitcity and he has been laying back and not scumhunting at all.

MMM hasn't been inno'd at all.
The first point I'd make (although I'm guessing you're all bored by it) is MMM's NKA. Like, it rested on a really heavy number of assumptions ""scum killed MF because he was weak scumreading them"", ""MF definitely wasn't scumreading ANY mafia"" etc. and it feels really out of place. And it feels gross that he basically used it to pull himself out of the lynch pool.
He had Titus as scum D1 but never really pushed her- and in fact attacks BYF's case on Titus later.
""1. Is that supposed to translate to ""don't lynch me after I mislynch Gamma/MMM""?""- this really pings me because it's such a huge stretch and is hugely pedantic
I don't see him evaluating PP/me which should pretty much be the top priority for town in his position

it's not incredibly strong but there are a great number of players I find it hard to see as scum
MMM is not one of them",71675,2017-06-03 15:47:00,2616
10619,MMM,"If he's full JK/generally speaking was able to JK last night, why would he JK Ray?
Elaborate on how Tarkus was obvtown?
While my sentiment is the same, not everything scum does has to be scum motivated, and town believing that it absolutely has to be the case lost me my last completed town game (shoutouts Grey) and if it costs this game as well I'm gonna be salty as fuck
Gunsmith ""innos"" aren't even proper innos.


And now we get to the meaty bit.


""he hasn't been innod so he must be scum""
You're definitely right... in that I'm getting bored of it.
I've explained before the reason I did it is because he was not the most widely town read player - by all accounts that should have been Kelvin. Especially now that we have confirmed Kelvin is indeed town, my NKA holds. It made me question BYF's alignment (and rightfully so) and led me to a scum pool which currently consists of one confirmed scum, one basically confirmed town, and 4 people who are nowhere near clear, as well as a town pool of 3 confirmed town - from my own point of view, anyway. I think I was absolutely on point with that whether you agree with me or not.
Also if I did say that he could not have been heavily scumreading mafia (which I don't think I did), then that was wrong of me, and what I will have meant to say is that people he had weak suspicions on were worth looking into more than people he had strong suspicions towards (notice I didn't put GE in the townpile).
As for excluding myself of the lynch pool... that's not scum motivated no matter how the hell you look at it unless you're implying town should WANT to be lynched and is a pathetic thing to say.
And please do list the other heavy assumptions I made - I see one.
Titus went from scummy to null to scummy (after the Fitz claim), and I believe that you're incorrect in that I didn't push her. In fact I was the first to reaction test her (from which I got scum vibes), I later pressured her to explain why she thought Mort was scum, etc. I ended up not voting fitz before the L-1 and claim because I felt it was dumb at the time and even if Ircher did end up being right about it, I didn't see a good case at the time, and was, as you know, busy with someone else.
""this really pings me because it sounds like he scum reads me""

p/ sure i already said this in more detail, but i see everything he did from a genuine town perspective
 nope- just mentioning that it made you more lynchable than PP who is my other non-townread 


or not. MF was also widely townread. it's possible they thought he was a power role, etc.

If you name a pool of 6 people, scum being inside it is not a massive shock.

but manipulating things to make you seem like town is scum-motivated

1. The reason Mafia killed MortFeld was because he was weakly scumreading one of their members.
2. Posts like 705 or 1569 would make Mafia want to nightkill Mort
3. You're assuming Mafia are not just killing people who are suspicious of them, but those who HAVE been suspicious of them. For example, MF wasn't suspicious of me near the end of today; he eases off in posts like 1641 and questions RF's scumread of me in 1733.

Granted there are only three big assumptions but they are all pretty major.


Yeah, there's no real way to tell whether this is true or whether you weakened up because you are scum with Titus so let's just drop this. 


My point stands.

Nah, you did have time to do it. Actually- why not do it now?

Honestly I know my MMM case is pretty unconvincing but I do feel like he's the only one not ringing any townbells for me and there is literally no other case around.

10622,MMM,"Link the post where you did elaborate?

Fine.

I don't recall either Mort or Kelvin striking me as a PR, so unless scum thought differently I think they'll have gone with the player who had the more accurate view of the game.

It's not only the one scum that's in the pool, it's also the fact that the two players in the town pool are now confirmed town and all other players in the scum pool are alive lynchable, bar Ircher. My analysis probably won't lead to a perfect happy ending but so far it's been pretty damn close.

Still think town would want to be town read but... sure.

No I'm pretty sure that all of those are basically the same thing.

Fair.

Yet you do the same thing again in this very post. I'm fully aware that town can only have so much certainty and confidence in their reads but your emphasis on it is unsettling to me.

A reread isn't something that takes 30 minutes - at least not in my mind.

I could find at least 1-2 more examples if you wanted me to but regardless, the uncertainty isn't scummy, it's a fairly townie thing to have, but as I said you're emphasising it too much. Did I say you emphasise it too much yet?
Right now I'd wait for Ircher to post and full claim if his role is different from what he said, and we can see about who to lynch after that.

That aside, I feel more comfortable about MM4 after going through his actual reasoning for wanting me dead for what at least feels like almost the entire game. While Gamma+Priscila could be the scum team, I have had a really bad feeling about PP throughout the entire game and his hammer yesterday didn't make matters any better - if Ray's claim is true, which is most likely is, and there is a Mafia Doctor/Traitor, then I'd say it's likely PP, and I still believe there is one because 3-Shot GS/Odd Cop/Even JK/DV are too much power for town for the 2-Shot Roleblocker to be scum's only power, and Mafia Doctor just makes sense to me, at least partly due to prior experience.

10719,Ircher,"Ok, here is where I stand before I go do ISO reads:

Out of all of us, I feel Mario is the most likely to be town modulo claims (based on play basically.) The no gun result pretty much seals it for me.

RayFrost is indirectly confirmed as a Gunsmith by mod error imo. Furthermore, I don't see the benefit of scum!RayFrost faking a No Result on Priscilla and adjusting his acceptable claim of two-shot into a somewhat suspicious three-shot claim. Finally, town is way too weak if RayFrost is a scum Gunsmith or even a scum Goon. The setup basically requires him to be town. That said, his Night 3 result is meaningless: Priscilla is neither confirmed scum nor is Priscilla necessarily Ascetic. And the chances mafia have another roleblocking role is rather slim. Basically, we ignore the N3 result.

PenguinPower's play has been questionable, but RayFrost has a no guns result here. Honestly, we're probably gonna have to bite the bullet and assume this one is town. Mafia is way too weak if Penguin is Traitor and while mafia Doctor is plausible, I don't think it's likely.

10772,Ircher,"Reasons for targeting Gamma:

1) I townread Ray both on setup as well as gameplay in general (note: D1). The mislynch does not change that. Town is too weak w/o his role.
2) There are most likely two scum left; that means that the person they make do the kill is the one that they figure is most likely not to be jailed by me.
3) If I believe Ray's claim then I have no reason to assume that Penguin or Mario is scum. Furthermore, I townread Mario on play as well.
4) That leaves Gamma and MMM as confirmed scum from my PoV. There is the WIFOM, but I did state that I townread Gamma more than MMM. As a result, they would assume I would be more likely to target MMM, and as a result, I chose Gamma because I just cannot see RayFrost as scum in this setup.

I'll start here tbh
As mafia whose kill failed the level of confusion at the beginning of the day doesn't make sense. Wouldn't it make more sense to compose yourself to deal with the incoming guilty? My best example to describe this is my behavior d2 in Open 661. I had figured out the deal with the cop claims and who was likely getting copped since there was a fairly clea endorsement from Titus and both of the cop suspects heavily FOSed LQ, so I instantly figured out the cop result with a little bit of hinting by the cop d2 and went ""okay this guy isn't a push"".",71675,2017-06-10 23:36:00,3029

11110,MMM,"Aye.
As I've said before just the gunsmith inspects is weak since
1. it could just as well point to you
2. The explanation is really convoluted 
3. This would assume scum has no vanilla role, which I doubt given the amount of vanilla roles town has.

1. Why is Gamma not a main faction mafia?
2. Why would he be semi gamethrowing if he is?
3. Why is the fact he'd be semi gamethrowing as scum town indicative?

I've heard the point that Titus left due to being bussed brought up before and while I'm still iffy on the replacement occuring for that reason it is definitely true that it points to Gamma being scum if that is indeed the case.",71675,2017-06-11 19:40:00,3108
11111,MarioManiac4,"Use your hidden dayvig to dayvig fitz

11243,RayFrost,"Eh, since I'm here and procrastinating, here is the mental breakdown for my investigation targets:

MM4 was my first target because I had a midling read on him and felt from his posting that he was not likely to be killed if town and more likely to be pushed as a mislynch - if he's scum, his most likely partners were in my mind ircher, bigyoshifan, and mortfeld. All three of these people were uncertain reads on me, so the connective results meant I'd be likely to make further reads. Additionally, MM4 seemed really easy to influence and push toward my way of thinking toward later in the game, which is favorable in that I trust my reads and having someone I can push to follow me is an advantage.

Reason to not investigate other people: I genuinely did townread gamma after the day 1 interactions, I townread the Tarkus slot, had an iffy read regarding MMM (honestly was leaning scum or hard-scum to me all game), and I felt that the other players were more likely to die if they were town (aside from bigyoshifan - it was a tossup between the two, but yoshi felt like he'd be more stubborn and less likely to sheep me if I pushed for it in a late game situation).

N2, given the no-gun result on MM4, I was less likely to go with either of ircher / bigyoshifan due to the decreased connective read that I could get. And that day phase passed without me even really getting to be part of it. So it's back to ""who's unlikely to die"" - the lurked slot on penguinpower. There we go. Another hard to read but likely to live to endgame slot.

N3, I actually wavered between MMM and Priscila, but in the end I decided to go with trying for as many town-confirmations as possible rather than going for a scum confirmation. I felt that I could get that lynch on MMM without many issues regardless, so there's little to no reason to have a guilty on top of it. And at this point, I'm also trying to clear out the people that I am uncertain about in their connections to the read - gamma + MMM / Priscila + MMM / Ircher + MMM were what was left. 

With the discussion of mafia doc etc etc, I felt it was likely that if there was one on the scumteam that of any of the combinations, Ircher's claim made him the most likely to give a false innocent if he's guilty. So, I don't investigate that potential partner. With the others, it's a 50/50 between MMM or the other one giving a potential false innocent. Then, I still have a moderate townread on gamma (it's weakened but still there), so that leaves Priscila.

Then I got ruined by mod error and mod ""compensation"" lost all motivation to play the game because of the snafu and really lost my hold on the game since I went from a position of power to a position of what is this garbage nonsense and all of the posting surrounding that was essentially a full day of white noise with no purpose.",71675,2017-06-11 22:12:00,3241
11244,RayFrost,"If I had received no result on MM4, I would have investigated one of ircher / bigyoshifan come night two, likely ircher because yoshifan was actually a stronger townread to me if forced to pick between the two come night 2.

If I had received a no result on PenguinPower, I would have investigated PenguinPower again because of the negative whiplash regarding his hammer and I didn't feel that it was very alignment indicative and would want to clear that up so that we could get back to who I found suspect, which was MMM.",71675,2017-06-11 22:14:00,3242
