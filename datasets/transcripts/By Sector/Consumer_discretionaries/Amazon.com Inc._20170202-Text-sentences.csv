5,Actual results may differ materially
6,"Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings"
7,"During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures"
8,"In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures"
9,Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions
10,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC"
11,"Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements"
12,It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance

20,"Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question"
21,Question-and-Answer Session
22,"Yes, hi, Ben"
23,"We're very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world"
24,"Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well"
25,"The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement"
26,"And we have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal Store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers"
27,And so there's a mix of things going on in China and
28,we're happy with what we're seeing in both of those
29,"Yes, and this is Darin"
30,"On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China"
31,"Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers"
32,So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store there
33,"As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what we're seeing there"
34,"Hi, Mark"
35,"On the unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% unit growth that we saw in Q4 like you mentioned"
36,Our unit growth has been strong and that's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program
37,"As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story"
38,"Our Amazon Fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers and which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales and it grew nearly 40% over 2016."
39,So we're very pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective
40,Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices
41,"The vast selection which is helped by the FBA sellers and the strong convenience that we can offer through FREE Two-Day Shipping and the multitude of other faster shipping options such as Same-Day, Next-Day and in some cases with Prime"
42,"Now, the 1-Hour Delivery to 2-Hour Delivery"
43,So Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers
44,"Hi, Mark"
45,This is Darin
46,"On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter"
47,"As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million"
48,and I can say it's still growing
49,and we're pleased with the number there
50,What we do like is the engagement with Prime
51,"We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program"
52,So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year
53,"On the customer split, we serve â€“ in AWS, we serve millions of active customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies as well as small startups and the public company â€“ or public environment as well"
54,"The multitude of launches that we had in reinvent was great for all sizes of customers, really, both large and small; both companies starting â€“ just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years"
55,"And so we're really happy about the engagement of reinvent and the participation in that conference as well as the engagement of the new services that we've launched in Q4 and all of 2016, really"
56,"And on other revenue, I just want to call out, there's a number of things going into that particular line"
57,"These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising"
58,"We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories"
59,"And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising"
60,"And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that"
61,Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions
62,A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter
