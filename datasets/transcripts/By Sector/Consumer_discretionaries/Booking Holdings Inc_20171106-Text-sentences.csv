26,"GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS both increased by 240%, with growth impacted by the goodwill impairment charge in Q3 2016."

33,"About 34% of our gross profit converts to free cash flow, which is a function of attractive profit margins and capital efficiency for our business"
34,"Our cash and investments amounted to $18.4 billion at quarter close, with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S"
35,"Now for Q4 guidance, our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends"
36,Our guidance also reflects an exceptionally difficult prior-year comparable because our 31% room night growth in the fourth quarter last year was the highest we had achieved in several years
37,"Glenn just discussed steps we are taking to optimize the efficiency of our performance advertising spend, which we forecast will have a modestly negative impact on top line growth for the coming quarters"
38,"Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates, which favorably impact our growth rates expressed in U.S"
39,dollars
40,"We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges did not protect our gross bookings, gross profit or our operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations"
41,We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 8% to 13% and total gross bookings to grow by 9.5% to 14.5% in U.S

48,We forecasted adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit will be about 350 bps lower than prior year Q4.
49,Our Q4 forecast reflects an assumed improvement in year-over-year performance marketing efficiency
50,The deleverage assumed in our forecast reflects the investments in brand advertising and non-advertising operating expenses that Glenn just spoke about
51,"The investments in brand advertising and non-advertising operating expenses have a more significant margin impact in Q4 and Q1, which are quarters in which we earn a smaller share of our annual profits due to the normal seasonality of our business"
52,"We forecast GAAP EPS between $12.60 to $13.20 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is down by about 4% versus prior year"
53,"Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 49.7 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of common stock repurchases we've made to-date, offset by additional equivalent shares related to our convertible bonds due to the increase in our stock price"
54,"Our GAAP EPS guidance assumes a tax rate of 17% compared to the prior-year tax rate of 12%, which was beneficially impacted by non-recurring discrete items"
55,"We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share of approximately $13.40 to $14.00 per share, which at the midpoint is down by about 4% versus prior year"
56,"Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 18%, which is higher than the prior year rate for the same reasons I just discussed for the GAAP tax rate"
57,Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular
58,We will now take your questions
59,Question-and-Answer Session
60,"The couple of things I called out in the prepared remarks, Perry, were, in particular, the comp that we had to prior year, where we had really high growth rates and the steps that we're taking in performance marketing to optimize ROIs"
61,So I think that that will be with us for the coming quarters until we lap it
62,But I wouldn't call it structural
63,"And fundamentally, the travel market feels healthy"
64,You see the results reported by the big hotel chains and our competitors
65,It feels pretty strong to us
66,"The things that have driven our growth in the past, rapidly adding properties to the platform, that continues"
67,"And I'm confident that our teams will continue to execute very effectively in adding properties going forward, continuing to improve the experience for our customers on our platforms, which drives better conversion and loyalty over time, and then also continue to effectively advertise our brands to bring new customers to the franchise going forward"
68,So nothing structural from our perspective
69,"Okay, Mark"
70,This is Dan
71,I'll take that one
72,"So, yeah, we said that as we proceeded through the quarter, we experimented with ways to better optimize our performance marketing spend"
73,"And I'd say, relative to our guidance that probably had a modest negative impact on top line growth and had a favorable impact on our performance marketing efficiency and bottom line profitability"
74,"That said, we're still pretty pleased with the growth that our teams were able to deliver with the marketing mix that they employed"
75,And so we like the results that we saw in Q3.
76,You're welcome
77,"I'd just say that over time, driving customers to come to us directly should have a nice beneficial impact on overall advertising efficiency"
78,We'll reach some point in time where we're in the markets we want to be with brand advertising and we're spending the level of spend
79,we think that's right to get the reach and frequency that we want
80,And so we should be able to have good leverage in the longer term once we get to that optimal level of spend
81,You're welcome
82,"Deepak, in terms of the U.S"
83,"trend over the last several quarters, we're very pleased with the performance of Booking"
84,com in the U.S
85,We believe booking is growing its share in the U.S
86,", posting very healthy growth rates over the last several quarters"
87,So that's for the U.S
88,We've seen improving performance for the Priceline
89,"com business, which is a nice plus, too, as that's a U.S"
90,"And then, in terms of brand trends, our forecasts are done the way we do it every quarter, which is look at the actual results we've seen thus far in the quarter and trend off of that generally assuming that we'll see some deceleration as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter, given the size of the business and the long-term trends"
91,So we didn't build in anything specific related to the advertising spend that's planned for the quarter
92,"Our experience has been as we've done many years of TV advertising for Priceline and for KAYAK, and we've been active in TV advertising for Booking"
93,"com since 2013, it's a slower build"
94,â€“ a slower return on investment typically for that spend
95,"We are doing a better job and improving our capability to measure effectiveness of the advertising, but that doesn't mean it's positive ROI day one"
96,So we think it's going to be the right thing to do for the long term
97,"But in the short term, it's probably going to pressure margins and not deliver the same kind of pop to top line growth the way intent-based advertising would"
98,You're welcome
99,"As Glenn said in the prepared remarks, it's more just â€"
100,"“ it's been an ongoing trend for us that we've seen pressure on ROIs, deteriorating margins in our performance marketing spend"
101,And so it was re-evaluating that and looking for ways to start to arrest that trend and even move â€
102,“ starting in a more positive direction
103,So I'd say nothing specific
104,Our conversion continues to generally improve on our websites as our teams experiment to continue to see improve the experience for our users
105,And so nothing there that really drove it
106,"And I'm sorry, was there a second question?"
107,You're welcome
108,"And in terms of penetration, Brian, we've made the comment before that we've got a mid-single-digit share of the properties that are available on our website"
109,That's a broad statement of all the properties
110,But we've been very pleased with our vacation rental business
111,"It's been a fast-growing business for us, growing faster than our consolidated growth rate"
112,So you can assume that the performance there is good and that the penetration opportunity also exists there
113,You're welcome
114,"Regarding the size of the vacation rental business, we haven't disclosed those stats"
115,You can see the growth in the property count
116,And you can assume that we wouldn't be doing that if that wasn't growing fast for us
117,We've said that it's growing faster than the consolidated growth rate
118,So it's an important â€
119,"“ it's a meaningful part of our business, but we aren't going to disclose exactly how big it is today"
120,You're welcome
121,"And when you talk merchant commissions, Jed, I assume that you're just looking merchant gross profit divided by merchant gross booking"
122,"That's a function of timing, really"
123,"The fundamental take rates are stable, but we've got decelerating top line growth, meaning gross bookings growth have the benefit of checkout still occurring from prior faster-growing quarters, and so that's what you're seeing there"
124,You're welcome
125,I agree
126,There's nothing that was called out in the chain reports for the quarter that would lead me to believe that anything has changed significantly there
127,"And I'm with Glenn, I think the growth that we posted and the growth that we're guiding to is spectacular relative to the fundamental growth of the market"
128,The new alternative accommodation business is somewhat less profitable from a partner services perspective
129,"So there are less rooms for property, a lot of properties still to go and gather, and then, typically, requiring a little bit more help in working with our service because they're less sophisticated than the hotel properties that we had initially worked with"
130,"From a customer service perspective, too, a little bit more hands-on touch with customers given the unique nature of these properties"
131,"That said, the profitability of our vacation rental business is still very impressive, growing fast"
132,"We're making investments now, partly in the teams that are facing properties and facing our customers, to make sure we can stay up with the growth"
133,But we're also making significant investments on the IT side
134,"So we're adding teams of people under our booking home umbrella, and they're focused on improving the experience with property owners, including individual property owners that are putting their apartment or home up for rent, to make it a more intuitive experience, easier for them to self-signup and improve efficiency that way"
135,"And then, also on the customer service side, improve the experience on the website, there's a number of reasons why people contact our customer service teams asking questions"
136,"And as we see what's driving those contacts, looking to improve the amount of information that's available for the customer to serve themselves on the website, answer that question before they ask it"
137,Glenn talked about the use of machine learning
138,"Hopefully, we can bring that to bear also to just automate some of these processes"
139,So I don't know that it will ever be as profitable as our core hotel business from the perspective of partner services or customer service
140,But I think there is the opportunity to improve the profitability there and to see better trends over time as the business scales
141,"In terms of exclusivity, that's not something we typically strive for"
142,We want to win our partners' loyalty by bringing them demand at a reasonable price rather than some sort of contractual block-out of other demand platforms
143,"Then in metasearch, Michael, we're really pleased with the performance of our KAYAK business"
144,It's growing nicely
145,It's one of the bigger players out there on meta side
146,"And I'd say, it's â€"
147,"“ if you want to talk market share of profits, it's right near the top of the list"
148,"So very profitable business, growing"
149,I think run very responsibly by Steve Hafner and his team
150,And we're excited about the prospects of bringing Momondo and KAYAK together and sharing best practices from brand to brand and having the teams work together to make both brands stronger in the future
151,You're welcome
152,You didn't ask the second question about trivago
153,What's your question?
