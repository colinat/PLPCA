Thanks, Pat, and good morning, good afternoon to everybody
We appreciate you all joining us for our call here today
As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased actually to share our results both from Q4 2016, but also some commentary about 2017. I thought where would be good to start off is just share a few thoughts around the macro environment and some of the general industry trends, and talk a little bit how some of those play out specifically for us at BorgWarner
So I think the headline for us, and I think all of us on the call here, we're operating, we continue to operate in a sense of uncertain times globally, both I think from a political perspective and on an economic perspective
Whether it's the transitions in Europe and Brexit, China economic stability and growth, and obviously here in the U.S
with the new administration, it's somewhat of an uncertain time
If I take the areas that I think are most relevant to us from a BorgWarner perspective and I'll talk about, I think the two most meaningful things that are on people's mind
And I would say, it's the border adjustment or the NAFTA agreement here in the U.S
and also CAFE
So I just want to spend a couple of minutes proactively sharing some of our thoughts on those two topics with you
So let me start off with border tax or NAFTA
First thing is to calibrate us all, obviously about 25% of BorgWarner's revenue is in North America, so now puts it a little bit into context to you
The second thing when you looked, when you break down that revenue, it's really critical that we all kind of understand that we produced most of our products, the vast majority of our products both in the United States and in Mexico
So we're very well balanced, which gives us the flexibility to adjust production levels between the two countries
If you actually look at border flow, a traffic of our products and what products that move North or South of the border, the net-net of all of that is about $200 million
So our view of the world is, now you heard about $200 million on a $9 billion annual revenue total, that's quote for us, that's manageable, that's a manageable situation, particular with our flexibility of our footprint
So we continue to track the topic closely of course, but I – my message to you from a BorgWarner perspective, we feel well-positioned around border tax and NAFTA
The second subject that relates strongly to us, obviously, is around CAFE, and you know what if anything may evolve in that space
And I think, we're all aware that there's been, you know some discussion in the – particularly in the fourth quarter around revisiting the standards and adjusting the standards through the auto alliance recommendations
I think our view very simplistically produced that the line is going to continue to creep up
We're going to see more stringent fuel economy and emissions regulation
I think there could be some tweaking and adjustments of the line and the acceleration of the line, but there is no doubt in our mind, there would be a continued push for increased efficiency around fuel economy and emissions, and that plays really well
What is critical is as that slope evolves, it may or it will influence that the mix of hybrid, electric and combustion
That's really what fundamentally will go on, and that's why it's been so important for us as a company over the last couple of years, to position our portfolio that is well balanced for combustion, hybrid and electric, so we'll become agnostic to the change
So, more to come on CAFE, but our belief is the standards will continue to drive forward, and we're well positioned
So net-net these two big issues, that we track I think are very manageable for BorgWarner
The only other comment I would just highlight from a macro or industry perspective is – and I'll give a little color around market growth projections for 2017. I think we all should remind as of, we're operating in a pretty healthy environment from an auto perspective, something close to 94 million light vehicles produced this year, that's a pretty good number and a healthy basis to run our business from
So staying with slide five, where I started, let me give a little bit of color on the market outlook, as we see it into 2017. So from a light vehicle perspective, I would characterize our view is very much aligned and similar to IHS's view
So we're seeing 1% or 2% growth projection for China
We see Europe growing modestly at about 1%, and then North American production down about 1%
So it's a low to no-growth environment overall, but as I said, that's off a very, very healthy base of 93-plus million light vehicles
From a commercial vehicle perspective, I would characterize it as still a challenged space
We still see North America and Europe in a little bit of a down environment
We do see stabilization and a little bit of positiveness in South America, and we do see China getting better
But net-net, overall it's still a pretty challenging environment around commercial vehicle
Now as we go into the year and we follow the year, I always like to share on these calls
One of the areas of watch that we're particularly paying a lot of attention to at BorgWarner that can move our numbers around, I would characterize three key areas of watch for the company
One is, we recognize we're in the mature cycle in North America
So what's going to transpire around inventories and schedules, thus far we're seeing schedules playing out pretty much as we had hoped for
But we will obviously, like everybody, keep a close eye on the inventory levels as the year unfolds
I would say the second area of watch is diesel penetration share in Europe
We did see from 2015 to 2016, we saw about a 2% downshift in that mix between diesel and gas, and we do expect the penetration to continue to decline of diesel share in Western Europe versus gasoline
The good news for us as a company, even with that little bit of a downshift last year, we still delivered our growth numbers and we're finding a way to offset that shift down in diesel
And as you look forward for us as a company, with the advent of our product evolution around content on gasoline and hybrid vehicles, that's going to put us in a very good position as diesel shifts down
Last but not least, the other area we focus on, particularly with our strong backlog in China, is we're expecting modest growth in China
And we need to keep paying attention to that market a lot as well with – which is coming off the Chinese New Year
we keep a close eye on China, but I would say so far the signs are early but the signs are encouraging from a China market perspective
All of that said, summarizing that view of the market outlook, we're very confident in our growth that we projected for 2017 by some of the demand for our products and what we're seeing in releases
Let me just make a couple of comments on the regulatory or technology trend area
As I said earlier, we continue to see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is as strong as I've ever seen it
So no change, no backing off on the drive and the pull for advanced technology
We see that around gas, hybrids, and EVs
I would also like to just highlight that I think one of the really critical things that we see is that drive for advanced propulsion is very much globally playing out
So we see big pull in Europe and we see a very strong pull around hybrids and electrics also in China, but we also see continued advancements around combustion technology as well
So as we look at our focus on electrification, our Q4 new business bookings continued to show a very positive trend for us in terms of the business we were winning with a wide range of customers and regions
And we did receive new awards in all three categories of propulsion systems, combustion, hybrids, and electrics
Now I know many of you on the call like to keep score and keep track of numbers, so let me share a couple of numbers with you around awards
If you could cast your mind back to last year when we did our Investor Day, we talked about that we had 19 awards as a company for hybrids and electric programs that would be rolling out
And I would say to you in the fourth quarter, we added another handful to that list, so we're now sitting comfortably in the mid-20s type number of hybrid and electric vehicle program awards for the company
And our quoting activity remains very strong for other additional programs and customers
So the message there is still the strong pull for advanced technology and BorgWarner is winning
Let me turn now for a little bit if I can and talk about financial recap
I think I would characterize for Ron and I both and the rest of the management team, we were very pleased both with our Q4 performance and full-year 2016. For 2016, our growth came in toward the high end of our guidance range and very solid operating performance
So we feel very good about how we delivered 2016. If I give a little more color, if I can on Q4, and obviously Ron will provide a lot more detail here
So for Q4, $2.3 billion was our sales number
That's up 6.6% organic excluding FX and Remy
If I compare that to how we did versus the market, when I do comparable end markets for us, it was about 3.6%, which is solid outperformance of about 3% growth for us in the quarter
Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected
We benefited from very strong growth in China, as we saw a very strong environment in China for light vehicle
And we had very strong growth in North America also
I would say Europe for us was pretty flat, and this was a little bit offset also by some modest declines around the rest of Asia excluding China, aftermarket, and commercial vehicle off-road
All of that transpired into us delivering EPS of $0.85 when we exclude the non-comparable items, and that does include Remy
Our operating margin came at 12.6%, which we view as yet another solid quarter that we delivered
If I take down the Q4 numbers by segment for a moment, so engine sales were $1.39 billion, so growing just over 1.3%
In the quarter, there was a little bit of headwind from light vehicle, diesel, and also I would say commercial vehicle weighed a little bit on our growth for the Engine segment, but you also see some really, really strong operating margin performance from the Engine group, which was really good to see
Drivetrain sales coming in at $883 million, that's up almost 17% organically, which was a really strong quarter from Drivetrain on the growth side and the really good news around that, that was strong all-wheel drive sales, but also on our transmission business
And I would say it was pretty much around the world, but primarily in North America and Europe where we saw very strong growth in the Drivetrain segment
If I turn now and talk a little bit about 2017 outlook, the first thing to reinforce is our outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided just a few weeks ago last month when we were in Detroit
So recapping that a little for you, that's organic growth of 3.5% to 6% year over year, which we feel good about coming off of relatively flat market, that's good growth for us
Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to grow about 40 to 50 basis points, and that will drive EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share
I think the key point I would like to stress right now is we felt good and very confident about that guidance when we were with you in Detroit, and we feel exactly the same today
And on a slightly longer-term basis, we continue to believe that we're very strongly positioned to achieve that mid to high single-digit organic growth over the long-term
As Pat said in his openings comments, I just wanted to take a moment to share a little bit more color around some of our growth and some of our recent winnings
And if you look at the slide, you'll see highlighted some key products on those slides
And the message here that I'm trying to convey is, you'll see winning business in combustion, hybrid and electric
And I'm just going to pick a few examples that highlight what I'm talking about
One of the key products that we announced in the fourth quarter was our first electric drive module with an integrated transmission and we're going to be launching that on two EV vehicles for major Chinese OEMs and production will begin in the summer of 2017, which is pretty soon
Great example of our leadership position in propulsion for electric vehicles
You also see silent chain
This is really cool with Suzuki on their Solio hybrid vehicle where we're actually taking out chain technology, we're using two chains to transfer power from the electric motor to the transmission to power a hybrid vehicle
So it's a cool story of taking somewhat conventional combustion R&D technology from BorgWarner and applying that to a hybrid vehicle
You also see we talked about advanced turbocharger technology for hybrid, electric vehicles, and the example here is the BYD in China
And I think this is a particularly relevant point because I think we showed you together in the Investor Day that we have seen a very strong adoption rate of turbochargers on hybrid vehicles
To give you a snapshot, as we look out to the middle of next decade, around 2026, we believe 56% of hybrids will be using turbochargers
The fourth example that we've got up there is our advanced engine timing system for Alfa Romeo and that's on their 2-liter gasoline engine and this is a good example of some really advanced timing system technology that we've brought to the market that will continue to advance efficiency in the combustion powered vehicles
So this is as I said is just four examples, it just gives you a little bit of a snapshot
Overall we continue to see very robust quoting activity with multiple customers, multiple products
And I'm very happy with what I see in our bookings, I'm very happy what I see in our win rates
And I really like the diversification and the balance across the portfolio of electric, hybrid and combustion
And I also like the profitability numbers that I see that are coming with those business wins
So the message really is our balanced approach to drive in a broad variety of technology is absolutely working for us
So let me try and wrap up and summarize a little bit for you
I think 2016 was a really good year for us
We delivered what we said we would
We knew going into 2016, it was super important that we delivered four good quarters and we did it
We did it on the top-line and we did it on the bottom-line and we feel very good about that, that just gives us confidence as we go into 2017. I think the business is operating very well and we continue to be focused on executing strong short-term performance, but also laser focused on delivering the growth for the long-term
Comment also about M&A
M&A pipeline remained strong and active for us, and we're working very hard on that with our key focus on power electronics
So we really believe and we continue to believe we have a winning strategy that focuses us on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will absolutely deliver that mid-to-high single-digit organic growth that we've talked about
Before I turn it over to Ron, I just did want to take just a quick moment to recognize in our press release, the details we've put in around asbestos
And Ron will clearly give a lot more detail on that, but I just wanted to give at least a comment from my office as the CEO
And I feel very good about the clarity that we're bringing to this issue, both internally and in our external disclosures
We really understand this issue very well and we also understand the impact on our business, and now Ron will talk about that
I think for me what's really fundamental that I want to make sure is clear, is it is no change at all on our cash flow generation and how we go about running this growth company going forward
So with that, let me stop there and turn the call over to Ron
Thank you
Let me take a shot at that Ryan
So I would characterize it this way, I think where we landed in the fourth quarter versus where we thought we would at the beginning, if that makes sense to you is we got, it was a stronger quarter than what we had anticipated going into the quarter
And I think that's pretty consistent to what others have said
We did go in and expecting to outperform and grow at a double-digit number in China and we did a little better than that
So we grew well above the market, I don't have an exact percent for you Ryan, but Pat can get that to you offline, but we went in, expecting very strong growth and it came in even better than that and our market outperformance held even in that stronger environment, if that helps you
And again, Pat can get you
Let me say a couple things, Ryan
First and foremost, in terms of adding and expanding our capabilities around electronics and power electronics, it's important actually to know it's both organic and an M&A play, so we've been continuing to build and add capability and capacity organically, fundamentally through hiring the folks and we continue to do that, but specifically we were also looking to add through M&A
We do have a number of targets that were – we see and we're engaged in various levels of dialogue
I would say there's nothing externally in the marketplace that would be holding us back, if that makes sense, Ryan
So it's just purely a function of identifying the right technology capability within the company and then convincing them to sell, I mean that's the fundamental issue
So there is nothing – there is no overhang in terms of regulatory environment, in terms of as Ron alluded to, in terms of that capital deployment
We're ready to go do what we need to do
And the team is doing a great job of pursuing a number of targets
And it'll just be a case of getting one or more of those over the line as we can, Ryan
Thank you
Hey, David
Correct
No
So okay, I see you what you're getting at, David
Let me just take a moment maybe and give a little bit more color around this instead of just answering quickly
So basically, over the last several years, management has done some strategic initiatives on the defense side of this and put some stringent litigators in place, that's resulted in a very predictable environment for us on that side of it
That coupled with a very stabilized tort system came together at the same time, so that we're able to take a look at some actuary's people come in, some other professionals and have a very predictable stable environment
We're now – we're comfortable and actually making a 50-year estimate
In the past, we didn't have that type of environment
So it's kind of a convergence of several things coming together, that's mostly predictable
That's the most important word that I'm going to say here, it's predictable now
It wasn't predictable before
I can – let me – I'll try and take a shot at it for Q4, David
So as I think earlier, if you caught the earlier questions, from a China perspective, let me stop there
Ron said that, we grew it about 30% in the quarter year-over-year, which was pretty amazing
Obviously, if you look at what their production numbers were in China, that represents obviously very, very significant outperformance from us
We grew just about double-digit in North America, which again represents pretty solid outperformance
Europe, I would say, we would kind of below the market – light vehicle market in Europe, but that's a little bit history, where we have commercial vehicle in aftermarket revenue, a lot in Europe
So that's kind of a quick characterization
We can – Pat and I or Ron can give you a bit more of a full year view if you want offline, David, or in a follow-up call
I just don't have a good visibility on that in front of me
But that gives you a little bit of a sense for the quarter
Strong in – strong outgrowth in North America and China, and Europe about in line slightly down, it would be a way to think of it
I can spend a couple minutes on that David
So just a real quickly recap, obviously we talked about the three architectures combustion, hybrid and electric
What we basically said around combustion back at Investor Day was this is – the combustion is a flat market basically, it's about 88 million vehicles in 2016, and it stays about that slightly down, BorgWarner's revenue growth is about 5% over that same period 2016 through 2023, and we get that two ways, we get that through increased penetration rates, and we also ramp-up a little bit on our content per vehicle
So combustion goes from 185 to 250. So if you bear with me, and if I do that same kind of approach on hybrid, David, we have a compound annual growth rate of about 50%-something, over that period 2016 through 2023. Again that's delivered through significant penetration – vehicle penetration, where we go from about 20% up to 40%-something, and again content per vehicle climbs significantly
Similar story on electrics, where we continue to see significant growth content per vehicle evolves there as well
The upshot of all of that David, is if I was to say where are we sitting here today in February versus where we were, when we were in Investor Day
I would say we're on track, if anything slightly better or slightly ahead of where we thought we were back in September
And slightly ahead means, what I'm actually seeing as get over the line in bookings in hybrids and electrics and combustion
So we feel probably slightly more comfortable than what we even did back in September based on the evidence over the last four months or five months of booking
In all three areas David, that's the key all three
You're welcome
Let me take a shot if I can, David
I would say we were about a year into this
And so real briefly, I would say fundamentally it's performed pretty much as we'd expected
Top line is pretty much there other than a little bit of end market weakness
Operating-wise, it performed pretty much as expected
I would say the technology strength and depth that we've been pleased with in terms of the breadth and the strength of the product portfolio
I think the one incremental area that I would say is a little better than what we thought from when we went in is we're seeing the opportunity to combine the Remy product with the traditional BorgWarner product to differentiate ourselves with our customers on technology solutions, and we saw that with the electric drive module would be a great example very recently
So I would say that's how I would characterize that
I think the other element that we feel very good about was the divestiture of the non-core light vehicle aftermarket business
I think that was a really important move for us in a number of fronts, so we feel good about that
So now as we go into this year, the focus, David, just to give you a number in the three-year backlog, we characterize the rotating electric portion of our backlog was about 12%, which was up significantly from a year ago
And that's coming from two aspects
One is what I alluded to earlier, which is the combining of the Remy core technology with the BorgWarner technology to offer system solutions for our customers
And then the second area is finding ways to gain share with the more legacy product set of Remy, so basically selling more starters and alternators
Now we've got to leverage with BorgWarner than Remy did in its former life
So net-net all around, David, we're feeling very good about it
It's contributing from a top line perspective in a good way
And we're starting to get some traction on the margin improvements
Remember, when we started this business, it was about a 4% operating margin business
We'll get some incremental uplift this year without having the non-core aftermarket business, and we're comfortable we can expand margins on the core Remy business
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, David, to help
So just from a turbo perspective in its general sense, the core story there really is we're seeing obviously significant penetration uplifts in North America and China
That's where the growth story is playing out
Europe is obviously pretty much a saturated space in terms of turbocharger penetration
And I would say to you that's playing out as we expected
We're seeing rapid adoption rates in China and in North America
And Pat could give you some detail numbers offline if it's helpful, David
So we're seeing that play out
From our BorgWarner perspective, our market share expectations are playing out exactly as we thought
So we're winning where we thought we would win and we're doing well from a share perspective
So I would say that's encouraging too
And eBooster, we continue to get more and more traction there
We have a couple of production awards – or in production I should say in 2017 with a couple of key customer programs, and we see continued pull and demand for eBooster programs that we're quoting on and doing very well with
So we see that trend continuing from a technology point of view, and we're getting our share and doing quite well in winning that business
So hopefully that gives you some sense, David
Hi, Brett
I can take a shot at that, Brett, at least start on that for you
I would say first, your assumption is right where the lead space, if I can call it that, for electric is in China
So we are seeing more focus, more drive around pure electrics in China regionally than other parts of the world, but we are obviously seeing electric production rates in Europe and North America also
I would say all three regions somewhat equally are looking to optimize combustion technologies, so we're seeing that
And I would say that's pretty uniform around the world in terms of refinement optimization on combustion
Hybrid, also I would say regionally there's a pull, probably an equal pull for hybrids in the different regions of the world
Brett, what I would say to you on hybrids, where there's not a lot of difference regionally, you are getting different customer strategies around hybrids, and that's where Borg is playing a really key role because they're looking at different hybrid architectures, different ways of getting there, and that's where we're playing a strong role in helping them
So a little bit of regional variation, but I think ultimately I would say, Brett, the critical 30,000th point for us is, we've seen all the OEMs needing a balance of the three architectures and we're there to help them with that balance of the three
That's the really critical part
Thanks, Brett
Good morning, Rich
Yeah, sure
In terms, Rich, of the new wins, so to speak, it is pretty balanced regionally
I put those four examples up, Rich
I see that's a good characterization or a good representation of actually how it's playing out
So you've got a really advanced electric vehicle system that's in – at a China
You've got the latest and greatest turbocharger technology that's in Asia and China
Suzuki, as you see Alfa Romeo is a European, but I wouldn't be surprised when I show you the – in the next call, another four
They could be North American or whatever, see
I'm – it is pretty balanced
Both regionally, Rich, but also across the combustion, hybrid and electric propulsion space
Adam, it's James
So I would say, that's a pretty – a pretty good description you gave, and I would give you a little bit color of – kind of why I think that is, because I think it's a – if I can say it this way, it's an incremental evolution to the end game
They're not – and I think, you've seen this yourself, that it's not a light switch, where we're turning off from – turning off combustion and turning on the light, it's a – it's a – it's kind of a journey and it's an evolution
And the reason that's important, that does a couple of things, that allows us to be thoughtful and balanced in terms of making our investments, and evolving the portfolio as opposed to throw all of it away and bring a brand-new third on that we've never done before
And that's why we have the comfort and the confidence in the kind of evolution, because it's not a light switch type event
The other quick comment I would make Adam, that gives us incremental confidence is, as I've alluded to sort of last year, we are in production with hybrid technology, we're in production with electric vehicle technology
And we've been doing that over the last three years to four years, and still delivering the incrementals over that period of time
And what we're also seeing is the financial performance of those electric and hybrid vehicles is very good
So I don't want to characterize Adam, that this is easy, I don't want to tell you that, but I would tell you, we feel comfortable that this is more of an evolution than an event and we're comfortable, we can manage through it and deliver what we're saying we're going to do
Thanks for bringing that up, Joe
I think your note characterized it actually pretty well, frankly
So Bosch Mahle rough numbers is about 4% to 5% market share
And I think what it really, really confirmed is the barriers to entry in that turbo space a pretty hard, it's pretty tough and I think you alluded to that and we would confirm that
So lot of technology, lot of IP, lot of manufacturing capabilities et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, investment business
And yeah we defend that very, very strongly
And I think you see there is some, it's a tough space for them to do
In terms of how it plays out, I think we'll have to see candidly
We will see what plays out in terms of what happens with that asset
We do feel extremely positive about our position frankly speaking in turbo and we have about a third share
We talked about that, win rates are good, our booking rates are good, our technology leadership we feel really, really good about
And, yeah, so we're feeling good about it is the quick answer, Joe, but in terms of the specifics about deal plays out, we'll have to give that a little bit of time
Thanks, Chris (sic) [Brian]
I would say, Chris, if you think of what we did in the three-year backlog, where we broke out, the products actually by discrete products, but then also you can clearly see what's Engine and what is Drivetrain
My sense is, I would think that's probably a pretty good barometer for – on an annual basis, is a good way to think of it
So we provided the detailed breakdown there by product and by segment for you in the three-year view
I don't think you'll go too far wrong if you view the one-year view somewhat similar to the three-year view, if that's helpful for you
No, I don't think this – no, it would be my quick answer
And in terms of the margins on the – quick answer, from an Engine point of view, we're pretty high up there, right? So there's we're kind of keeping pace at an incremental bases and absolute are pretty much there
We've talked on the Drivetrain side
We've always said there's a little bit of room for incremental uplift there and we continue to drive that for sure
