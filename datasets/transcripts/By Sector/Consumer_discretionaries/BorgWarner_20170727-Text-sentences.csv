3,"Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck, which is posted on our IR website"
4,Let's turn to slide 12.
5,"On a reported basis, sales were up 2.6%"
6,"On a comparable basis, our organic sales was up 7.8%"
7,This was approximately 130 basis points ahead of the high-end of our guidance
8,Our weighted average light vehicle industry production was down more than 1%
9,"So we saw also a 25% growth in China, against a production market that was down about 1%"
10,"Commercial vehicle was of benefit as well, contributing more than 100 basis points"
11,The primary headwinds versus our expectations were diesel/gas mix in Western Europe and market share loss by our largest Korean customer in China and North America markets
12,"Before I move to the operating profit, I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line items"
13,"Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago"
14,"R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4.4% of sales"
15,"SG&A was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by R&D and the timing of stock-based compensation"
16,"Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13."
17,"Q2 operating profit was $300 million or 12.5% of sales compared to $287 million in Q2 of 2016, which was 12.3% of sales, resulting in a 20 basis point improvement"
18,"On an organic basis, operating income was up $18 million on $176 million of higher sales"
19,That give us an incremental margin of 10% in the quarter and in line with our expectations
20,"As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $14 million in the quarter, up $4 million from last year"
21,"Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, down about $3 million from last year due to lower debt levels"
22,"Excluding the $10 million one-time favorable tax adjustment, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter"
23,"Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $9 million, down $2 million from the second quarter of 2016."
24,This line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures
25,This includes the reduction of $77 million of sales from the divestiture of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket
26,"Sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 13.8%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive transmission components and strong DCT growth in China"
27,Adjusted EBIT was $110 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.9% of sales
28,"On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $133 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 14%"
29,"Our total company incremental margin for Q2 was 10%, which is below our long-term goal of mid-teens, but was slightly improved from our quarter one performance"
30,"Our Drivetrain segment incremental margins were 14%, which was up from 13% in Q1 and 11% in Q4, strong performance as we continue to ramp launching programs in this business"
31,"As a result, the segment incremental margins were 15%"
32,"So, corporate costs were basically flat sequentially and are expected to moderate in the third and fourth quarters, but was up about $9 million year-over-year"
33,The drivers of this increase continue to be the timing of additional stock-based compensation cost and various advisory fees for tax and legal planning
34,These items unfavorably impacted incremental margins by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter
35,"Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow"
36,"We generated $399 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, up $37 million from the first half of 2016."
37,"Capital spending was $254 million year-to-date, up $20 million from a year ago"
38,"Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending, was $145 million, up $17 million from 2016."
39,"Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt was flat and cash decreased by $57 million compared with the end of 2016."
40,The $57 million increase in net debt was primarily due to return of capital activities
41,"Our net debt to net capital ratio was 33.2% at the end of Q2, down slightly from 35% at the end of 2016."
42,Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.16 times
43,"Now, let's discuss our 2017 guidance, which we have increased"

45,"Backlog, pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive 6.5% to 7.5% organic sales growth"
46,Currency is expected to reduce sales by $100 million
47,"The first half backlog was very strong, and this amount is flowing through in our increased guidance"
48,"So, I'd like to note a few items which are impacting our second half organic growth relative to our first half as I suspect many of you will ask questions on this"
49,"So, first, North America mix changes from the key North American programs, some of which are changeover-related or having modernization issues on us in the second half"
50,"Continued volume reduction from our largest South Korean customer in China and North America, and North America commercial vehicle modernization from the first half are all the items that we see in the second half of our guide"
51,Many of these items are timing related when you look at the first half and second half
52,"Overall, 6.5% to 7.5% organic growth for the year is very strong, given the industry backdrop and stronger than our expectations going into the year"
53,"Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 18."
54,"From a performance perspective, we continue to expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth"
55,"Included in this are some headwinds from corporate costs, and we continue to expect an inflationary environment and compliance cost"
56,Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 30 basis points to 40 basis points
57,"To finish up the full year guidance, please turn to slide 19."
58,EPS range is now $3.65 per diluted share to $3.70 per diluted share
59,The $0.12 increase is driven by our sales guide increase
60,"Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be $450 million to $500 million"
61,"Given our announcement of Sevcon, acquisition of our share repurchase program will be about $100 million in 2017."
62,R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be 4% in 2017.
63,The tax rate is expected to be 29%
64,Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to $1.10 from $1.05.
65,"As a reminder, every $0.01 change in the dollar-to-euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million"
66,"I'm aware that the exchange rate is about $1.16, but $1.10 is an average rate for the year"
67,Our third quarter guidance is starting on slide 21.
68,"First, sales"
69,Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are $68 million
70,"So, starting at a base of $2.146 billion, net new business, pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth from about 3% to 6%"
71,Currency is expected to reduce sales growth by about $36 million
72,"Therefore, 2017 Q3 sales is expected to be $2.2 billion at the midpoint"
73,"From an EPS perspective, on slide 22, we expect $0.03 to $0.06 per share from backlog, foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.02 a share in the quarter"
74,Below the operating income line items are expected to contribute $0.05 per share from lower share count and a lower tax rate
75,"As we look at 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around new product development and support it with acquisitions to participate in the impending electrification trend"
76,"What happens with FX even though there is a benefit from our prior guide, we only pull about $0.12 on the dollar, 12% incremental versus operating incremental of mid-teens"
77,"So, there tends to be a drag on us on margins going forward from the incremental margins"
78,"Yeah, Joe, a lot of parts moving"
79,"So, first of all, your question about the fourth quarter is correct, more margin expansion in the fourth"
80,One item
81,", I keep talking about the corporate cost, we love to have corporate cost"
82,And we may even be lower than the prior year in corporate cost
83,And then also we get a little bit of volume that the DCT plant's really starting to hum along
84,"So once that starts coming along, that might get a little higher incremental for us as well, which is in the Drivetrain segment"
85,"So, a combination of few items"
86,"It was $0.5 billion â€“ $500 million, and now the organic guide implies about $715 million, you're right"
87,"So, it's about $200 million increase"
88,What we're seeing in the second half?
89,I listed a bunch of items in there
90,We're seeing some that wasn't anticipated actually until just recently
91,"One of our largest Korean customers is having a difficult time, especially in the back half of the year in China and North America"
92,"We also have a changeover that's in North America in one of our largest customers' platforms that they've announced quite frankly yesterday, that's also going to be a little bit of a headwind for us"
93,So we're seeing a few things in the back half of the year that are headwinds
94,"But if you really go back to our original guidance, that guidance include about $100 million per quarter, roughly $125 million, of backlog"
95,"So, we haven't adjusted that, right, at the end of the day"
96,"So, it's still outgrowth"
97,and we haven't really adjusted from the original guidance
98,I think you got to look at the full year
99,"organic growth is how you got to look at it, not the cadence by first half, second half"
100,"That would net out of â€“ a little bit in market, but we probably net it out of the backlog number"
