0,"Thank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone"
1,We are pleased to report another strong quarter
2,"As always, I will talk about the quarterly results including the impact of Hurricane Harvey, then I will turn the call over to Tom to review financing after which I will comment on our initiatives as well as share some information on Hurricane Irma"
3,Our used unit comps for the second quarter increased by 5.3% and total used units grew by 11.1%
4,"Used unit comps continue to be driven by strong store execution as well as enhancements to the online customer experience, both of which support an increase in conversion"
5,The impact of higher conversion on comps was partially offset by the effects of lower store traffic
6,"As you may recall, Harvey hit Houston during the last week of our second quarter"
7,CarMaxâ€™s first priority will always be the safety and wellbeing of our associates
8,"We have approximately 1,000 associates in the Houston area and while all of them are safe now, many were affected by the hurricane"
9,We supported them with financial assistance through our Associate Disaster Relief Fund and provided them pay for the regularly scheduled shifts while the stores were closed
10,"In addition, we sent emergency supply to Houston as soon as possible to support associates and their families"
11,All six of our stores in the Houston market were closed for the last 5.5 working days of the quarter
12,Five of the Houston stores reopened on Friday September 1st with relatively little damage
13,Our Gulf Freeway store remained closed until Friday September 8th
14,"We estimate the impact to our comps to these closures was small and as we said in the past, weather can delay sales but we generally expect to make them up in future periods"
15,This event reminded me once again of the incredible value of our national footprint and our nationwide transportation network
16,We have been able to leverage both as damaged vehicles needed to be removed and replaced with vehicles from other markets to quickly support the needs of our customers
17,"Now, Iâ€™ll update you on some more of the numbers"
18,"In the quarter, we were pleased to see website traffic growth of 17%, which we believe was partially result of our efforts in SEO"
19,"Gross profit per used unit remained consistent at $2,178 compared to $2,160 in the second quarter of last year"
20,Our wholesale units grew slightly in the second quarter
21,The growth in our store base and an increase in buy rates were offset by the continuation of lower appraisal traffic
22,"Gross profit for wholesale unit increased to $950 compared to $870 in last yearâ€™s second quarter, largely due to a favorable depreciation environment in this second quarter"
23,A few other topics and Iâ€™
24,ll turn the call over to Tom
25,"As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four-year old vehicles increased to 80% versus about 76% in last yearâ€™s second quarter"
26,"As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks rose to 27%, which is similar to last quarter but up from about 25% in last yearâ€™s second quarter"
27,"On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased almost 11% to $405 million"
28,This represents a year-over-year reduction of $9 per unit in SG&A
29,"Several factors impacted SG&A growth including the 12% or 19-store increase in our base since the beginning of second quarter of last year, higher variable cost due to our increased sales, and an increase of about $16 million in our accrual for incentive pay"
30,"Remember that last year, we disclosed the measurable reduction in SG&A related to incentive pay"
31,"These were partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense which was largely due to comping over the $10.9 million retirement related expense for our former CEO, recorded in last yearâ€™s second quarter"
32,"As we previously discussed, we continue to invest heavily in technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer experience"
33,"SG&A expense was in line with our expectations in the second quarter but recall that the first quarter saw the benefit from favorable expense timing, some of which could materialize later in the year"
34,"Lastly, during the second quarter, we opened three stores, one in the Hartford market, one in San Francisco and one in Salisbury, Maryland"
35,"During the third quarter, we plan to open five stores, one will open in Tyler, Texas, which is a new market for us, the other four stores are in current markets including Philadelphia which we just opened a couple of days ago, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle"
36,"Now, Iâ€™ll turn the call over to Tom"
37,"Thanks, Tom"
38,We continue to be focused on driving whatâ€™s possible through both execution and innovation
39,We are in a unique position to combine the state-of-the-art online experience with the exceptional customer service our associates are known for
40,"Whether in store or online, we want to give our customers the tools and support to find the perfect car, purchase that car and then receive that car all on their own terms"
41,"Last quarter, we gave you an update on the test of our online appraisal tool"
42,This is a new online tool that allows customers to receive an appraisal value for the vehicle by submitting information online
43,We rolled out this product to the rest of our Charlotte market stores this past quarter and in the third quarter we plan to expand to more stores in the Midwest
44,Weâ€™re receiving great feedback from our customers and sales team about this new offering
45,The purpose of this test is to further learn about the customer demand for online appraisals and to ensure a great experience that is scalable across all stores
46,Weâ€™ll take the learnings from this next round of test to continue to enhance the product and determine when it should be rolled out to more of our stores
47,We also shared with you last quarter
48,"the progress weâ€™re making in digital merchandising, which is how we showcase our vehicles on carmax"
49,com
50,"In addition to the rollout and improvement of indoor photo studios, weâ€™re expanding our capabilities by offering 360 degree interior photos with zoom capability"
51,Weâ€™re now testing this product in vehicles at seven stores
52,These are just a couple of examples improvements weâ€™re working on
53,"We will continue to build out our e-commerce capabilities and equip our associates with the right tools to make the entire car buying process simple and seamless, both online and in our stores, and we truly feel that no one is in a better position to do that than us"
54,"Before I open up the line for questions, let me give you a brief update on the impact of Hurricane Irma"
55,Weâ€™re pleased to report that all of our stores are open for business
56,"We closed 28 stores, primarily in Florida and Georgia for varying lengths of time in September"
57,"And as we previously discussed with weather events, we would expect to realize those sales later"
58,"Now, at this time, weâ€™ll be happy to take your questions"
59,Question-and-Answer Session
60,"Good morning, Sharon"
61,"So, on those, both the photo booths and the 360 photos, we assess the success of those by clicks on the websites on those particular cars"
62,"So, obviously, not all of our photos are done in photo booths"
63,"And so, we look at the success, the number of clicks we see on those cars, as well as the conversion of those vehicles compared to other inventory that doesnâ€™t utilize those capabilities"
64,"As far as the time that it would take to roll it out, I talked about last quarter,"
65,"the photo booths, at the time, we already had 16 open; this year, weâ€™re on schedule to get 19 more of those open"
66,"And then for the 360, weâ€™ll see"
67,"Right now, we already have it in seven stores, and weâ€™ll see how it goes, and weâ€™re still working on the equipment, that kind of thing"
68,"I canâ€™t really tell you, okay, next quarter will be this number and that number, because weâ€™re still looking at the experiences"
69,"We want to make sure, when we roll it out more widely that it meets what we would expect from a CarMax standpoint from exceptional experience"
70,"I think the rollout is -- we can only handle so many different projects in any one given year, while there is an expense associated with it, thatâ€™s not the reason why we arenâ€™t rolling them out quicker"
71,"So, we can only --"
72,"I mean, weâ€™re adding an additional 19 more this year on a base of 16."
73,It just takes time and resource to get those built
74,"So, on the remodels, weâ€™re doing 10 more full remodels"
75,Weâ€™d like to work to photo booths into that
76,and then we go
77,and we choose certain other markets to go back and put the booths in
78,"So, Brian, Iâ€™ll talk about the first part"
79,You hit it on the head
80,Weâ€™re not going to provide guidance
81,"What I will tell you is that we are prepared with inventory; weâ€™re prepared, if there is an inflow and extra inflow of vehicles being bought, weâ€™re in great shape to handle that in the markets that were impacted by hurricane"
82,"Believe it or not, if you look at that historically, we had the benefit of not having big catastrophic events like this that often"
83,"I think the last time, we cited something like this was probably back with Wilma and Rita where we actually talked about it in the call"
84,"But, I would just tell you, weâ€™ve positioned ourselves so that weâ€™ll be able to meet any demand that surfaces"
85,As far as were there -- any vehicles were damaged
86,"We had about a 1,000 cars that were damaged that had to be gotten rid of, basically scrapped"
87,And I will let Tom talk a little bit about the expense
88,"We talked about this last quarter and I think at the end of last year -- at late last year, we did raise rates pretty much across the board"
89,"I think this is the first securitization deal, 2017-3 where you are actually going to start seeing the impact of that"
90,"and I think you can see the impact in that -- in the spread, if you look at that versus other recent deals"
91,As far as where rates go
92,"I am going to answer that the way that I always answer this for the last seven years, which, our ability to preserve that margin is going to be driven by the market and whatâ€™s going on with other lenders"
93,We are constantly looking at how we feel about our competitiveness versus other offers out there
94,"We test rates up, we test rates down"
95,"We try to make -- we watch our 3-day payoff rate, we watch conversion of the stores"
96,"So, it will be an ongoing analytical exercise"
97,"To the extent rates go up, you could imagine weâ€™ll test increasing, I mean if the [cost of funds][ph] go up, weâ€™ll test increasing APRs, but if itâ€™s going to be detrimental to sales or make us uncompetitive relative to what other competitors are doing, weâ€™ll have to take that into account"
98,"So, I will just kind of run through what we saw coming in the door"
99,"As I mentioned, we were barbelled in the credit profile of the customer coming in applying"
100,That means we saw the greatest growth at kind of 700 plus FICO range
101,"So, those folks tend to be the ones that are going to be CAF or can arrange their financing elsewhere"
102,"So, Matt, I think some of what we saw was due to just the nature of the volume coming through"
103,We did use some tightening in the quarter that may have impact in last yearâ€™s fourth quarter but that may have impacted a bit
104,But we look very closely at how competitive we think our rates are
105,"Our offers, particularly at the high end I think are still very competitive"
106,And we also track that 3-day payoff rate which is good indicator of whether people like the offers they get from CarMax
107,"That rate is up modestly year-over-year, less than a point, and itâ€™s actually down a little bit sequentially from last quarter"
108,"So, I wouldnâ€™t read into that"
109,Weâ€™re seeing a lot more people paying off the loans
110,"When I look at it, I just think weâ€™ve got more people that are bringing their own financing to the table whether itâ€™s cash or something else, when they show up to buy the car"
111,Yes
112,I donâ€™t --
113,weâ€™ve talked about this before when Tier 3 was significantly higher
114,It is a business that we look at as incremental
115,"So, I donâ€™t know what the right baseline is?"
116,"Iâ€™d like to see going forward just kind of nice growth across the credit spectrum, because I think that implies the healthy economy and healthy demand environment"
117,But this yearâ€™s number is up slightly
118,"As I said, weâ€™re seeing some volume increase in applications down in the spectrum"
119,"And remember, last year, we were seeing significant declines in that Tier 3 volume, and last yearâ€™s number is a weak number"
120,And this was actually the first quarter where weâ€™re comping over that
121,Yes
122,"I mean, traffic was down a modest amount, which offset some of the conversion"
123,Itâ€™s been similar to recent quarters
124,"Let me talk a little bit about SEO, because I think weâ€™re really pleased with the growth that weâ€™ve seen there"
125,"In the second quarter, our non-brand SEO traffic continued to grow significantly; it was up nearly 250% from a year ago"
126,"And on the SEO, what weâ€™ve really been focusing on is really three main things"
127,"One, we want to produce more content that links to other site, so putting articles out there to get picked by the folks, so that back linking is very helpful in the ratings"
128,Weâ€™ve added in the quarter a few hundred thousand new pages and we continue to add them
129,"So, last quarter, I talked about having a page -- we used to have a Ford F-150 page"
130,and we said
131,Ford F-150 Raptor
132,"Now, weâ€™ve got a Ford F-150 Raptor 2016, 2017."
133,"Again, the more pages you have, the relevant youâ€™re in the searches"
134,"And then, we also are pleased"
135,", weâ€™ve been able to add content and put the content in there"
136,"So, Google can actually and the search engines can actually read it and see what we have, which also helps us"
137,"So, weâ€™ve been very pleased with whatâ€™s been going on with SEO"
138,And we think there is a lot of opportunity still there
139,"The other thing I would just say on the earlier piece on the traffic, again, while that store traffic numberâ€™s gone down, we really look at it more holistically"
140,"And we think about the store traffic, we think about web traffic, which I talked about earlier and the great growth that weâ€™ve had there"
141,"We also continue to see double-digit growth on leads, which is great because that gives us something to execute on"
142,"So, we feel very good about the momentum that we have when it comes to having possibilities to interact with the customers and turn them into sales"
143,"Well, similar to like Katrina, there are going to be a lot of flood vehicles out there"
144,"And all of the damaged cars that we had, we actually took them and sold them through"
145,We did not sell them through auctions; we sold them through salvage auctions
146,Our systems are way more advanced today than they were back at the time of Hurricane Katrina
147,"We know, for example the cars that were on our lot, weâ€™ve got them on our system"
148,"So, if they ever pop up somewhere else, weâ€™ll know not to purchase them"
149,"Now, they should all be marked salvage, so they shouldnâ€™t pop up somewhere else"
150,"But the same thing for other vehicles, other vehicles that are marked salvage, we know that information"
151,"and then when weâ€™re at auctions or if they come to our appraisal lane, our systems will alert our buyers to the fact that hey this vehicle was at some point salvage"
152,"The other thing that I would tell you is -- and this is where our more than 1,000 skilled buyers come into play, there could be some cars out there that slipped through the cracks and didnâ€"
153,"™t get salvage, not our vehicles but ones that come in our appraisal lane"
154,And our buyers are skilled and trained to be able to identify those vehicles
155,There is telltale times that they can look for and I think thatâ€™s a huge competitive advantage to make sure that we donâ€™t end up buying any of those that might fall through the cracks of the data analytics
156,Yes
157,"I think the way to characterize it is that that number is going to move around a little bit every quarter because like the CarMax Auto Finance business, we put a reserve on that thing for returns"
158,"And then, some quarters you might see mildly favorable return experience, some quarters mildly negative; the last couple have been mildly favorable"
159,"So, there is a little bit of a tailwind on that number due to the return reserve percentage"
160,"But in general, itâ€™s grown with the pace of growth of sales"
161,And thatâ€™s how I think about it over the longer term
162,Yes
163,"I think the way you should about it is we do know, first of all, 9 out of 10 of the customers buy from a start their search online and interact with us on the digital properties"
164,I do absolutely feel like customers are coming to the stores more prepared
165,"So, for example, they know that theyâ€™re going to need a step; they bring it with them versus coming in and having to leave"
166,Certain things like that would actually cause your store traffic because we count it by being braced
167,would actually cause it to go down or innovation like the online finance prequalification
168,There may be some customers that go online and realize I canâ€
169,™t afford a new used car
170,"and it keeps them from coming into the store where they would have come in before, sales consultants would have spent time with them only to find out that they werenâ€™t eligible to buy a car"
171,"So, in some senses, I would expect because of our innovation, the traffic would go down, as we continue to innovate and make more of the functionality available online"
172,"So, again, Iâ€™m pleased with where we are, if I think about the touch points that we have with customers, whether itâ€™s in the store or whether itâ€™s online"
173,Weâ€™ve talked about our appraisal lane vehicles history have always been more profitable than the offsite
174,"As far as, I think, if I understand your question, really asking about the online appraisals and how we think thatâ€™s going to manifest itself"
175,Yes
176,I donâ€™t
177,mean -- weâ€™re not intending that shift
178,"I mean, we think that the online appraisal offering is just another way to reach out to customers that maybe we wouldnâ€™t have gotten before and also enhance the customer experience,"
179,"so folks know what their vehicle is worth, prior to coming into the store, prior to selling it"
180,"So, the way I look at it is itâ€™s really an extension to generate more appraisals"
181,"Look, we had 11% growth in sales"
182,When you have double-digit growth in sales like that
183,Youâ€™re going to have to obviously rely on offsite
184,"I would tell you, I think there is a lot of good offsite buys out there"
185,Itâ€™s
186,the number of year to four year all cars coming into the auction lanes is higher than it has been in the past
187,and I think it will continue to be that way
188,"So, I donâ€™t see a real change in the dynamics"
189,I think weâ€™ll continue to go after as many appraisal buys as we can
190,and then weâ€™ll supplement with whatever need through outside channels
191,"Itâ€™s too early to talk about that Mike, at this point"
192,"I mean, like I said in my opening remarks"
193,"It seems to be well received by customers; our sales folk, sales teams are very pleased with it, but itâ€™s too early to tell which is another reason why weâ€™re going to roll it to some additional stores"
194,"I think for the longest time, people have said that the sky is falling, when it comes to used car pricing and there is going to be a big drop in used car prices"
195,"While we are seeing some acquisition prices more favorable, like this quarter our ASPs actually went up, and thatâ€™s the combination of acquisition price going down a little bit, but then our mix impacting it to go up"
196,"So having more zero to four-year old cars, having more large SUVs and trucks"
197,I think what weâ€™ll continue to see is weâ€™ll continue to see more late model cars entering into the marketplace
198,Itâ€™s hard to tell
199,", what the two storms, this is lots of different numbers, I think anywhere from 0.5 million to 1 million cars"
200,And you go to wonder of that
201,", how many of them are actually going to be replaced"
202,"So, I think, itâ€™s little early to tell us as far as what impact this is going to have on the overall market"
203,"I will tell you -- and I mentioned in the opening remarks, the depreciation environment has absolutely been more favorable"
204,"Itâ€™s more representative of what we saw two years ago, which is one of the reasons why our wholesale margin is up over last year"
205,"So, I think itâ€™s little too early to tell us as far as the storms go as to what impact itâ€™s going to have on values"
206,Itâ€™s pretty consistent with whatâ€™s itâ€™s
207,been the last few quarters
208,Thatâ€™s double-digit and itâ€™s a little bit more than the website traffic growth that we saw
209,Yes
210,I think the quality of the leads is very similar to what we have seen over the last few quarters
211,"So, there is no real big difference there"
212,"Look, I think any time we get a lead is an opportunity for us to execute better"
213,"So, I would love for us to be able to have those leads convert at even higher"
214,"And again, I think our job is to make sure that we continue to put experiences out there and functionality out there and continue to train our associates on how to maximize those leads"
215,"So, thatâ€™s what we are focused on"
216,"Yes, no, look, we are pleased with where we are on home delivery at this point"
217,I would remind you
218,"I mean, we want to make sure that the customer can find the right car, take it out, buy that car"
219,and then we deliver it on whatever terms they want to receive that car
220,Home delivery is one of those ways
221,And expedite delivery in the store is another one of those ways
222,And I think the big success in home delivery at this point is the additional functionality that weâ€™ve learned about and progress
223,"So, for example, online appraisals, you need to be able to do that for home delivery"
224,"And as you see, we are continuing to move forward with online appraisals"
225,"We want to make sure that when we expand home delivery, it meets up to the exceptional customer experience that we would expect and that our customers would expect"
226,We have not expanded beyond the Charlotte market right now
227,We are evaluating where to take it next
228,"But what I would also tell you is, weâ€™re progressing that with capabilities so that wherever we go the next experience is going to be even that much better"
229,"So, I am pleased with where we are in home delivery, and I am pleased with all the functionality that really enables home delivery, so that we can use it in other things"
230,"Rick, what it says is that I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that weâ€™re seeing losses that are more in line with our expectations"
231,"And remember, last year, we were in environment where losses were kind of moving in unfavorable manner from us"
232,"And as we are look into provision, we were having to play some catch-up and getting the allowance to the level that it needed to be, based on the migration of those losses"
233,"So, I think weâ€™re more of in an environment now where weâ€™re booking weâ€™re absolutely booking the loans at a higher expected loss than last year"
234,But weâ€™re not -- we havenâ€™t been seen that migration of bad performance and weâ€™re not playing --
235,the last two quarters are not playing catch-up
236,"As I mentioned, all the pricing changes that we made were over the course of the fourth quarter of last year"
237,"So, if you look at sequentially versus last quarter, weâ€™re behaving essentially the same in our underwriting decisions and our pricing decisions"
238,"So, I would attribute that then to kind of the credit quality coming in the door"
239,"And as I mentioned that the highest credits, what weâ€™re seeing that -- where weâ€™re seeing the largest growth this quarter, and that would translate into lower rates because those folks are going to qualify for better rates"
240,"So, I think, as I said, we have seen a higher mix of customers, but if any, weâ€™re looking at the performance of the portfolio and recent trends"
241,"As we mentioned last quarter and at the end of the last year, we made some changes to the way that we are calculating our loss allowance to make it a little bit more reactive to current trends"
242,"And like I said, last year we were chasing unfavorability; this year, itâ€™s been little bit more consistent"
243,Yes
244,"So, like I said, itâ€™s a little bit representative of what happened a couple of years ago where the depreciation ramped"
245,"Normally, you see depreciation throughout the year"
246,The slope of that ramp was pretty much muted
247,"So, there wasnâ€™t a lot of depreciation"
248,And weâ€™re wanting that doesnâ€™t proactively speculate or whatever on what vehicles are worth
249,"But when there is less depreciation in vehicles off their value, thatâ€™s typically not what normally happens this time of the year"
250,"So, when there is a favorable environment where there is not a lot of depreciation and the value holds up there, the dealers are willing to pay more money, and thatâ€™s"
251,what drove the prices up
252,"I mean, youâ€™d have to ask Amazon that"
253,"I mean what weâ€™re focused on is regardless of who the competitor might be, I think weâ€™re focused on making our business better and weâ€™re focused on continuing to be a leader in late model used cars"
254,All the initiatives that weâ€™re working on I think point us in the right direction
255,I feel really good about where weâ€™re going and thatâ€™s
256,what our focus is right now
257,"On the online appraisal, like is said in my opening remarks, weâ€™re putting it into some of the stores in the Midwest and the purpose of doing that is one, to make sure that itâ€™s a great experience and itâ€™s"
258,what we want to do
259,Thereâ€™s going to probably some enhancements that weâ€™re going to want to make
260,And weâ€™ll at that point determine what the next step is and what the roll out
261,"So, I canâ€™t tell you what the timeframe is"
262,"As far as when that will be rolled out, it depends on how this next test goes"
263,What was the second part of your question?
264,"We probably have 15 different product teams that are working on digital enhancements, everything from SEO to improving the financing"
265,"I mean, some of these things like finance online for example, but we made some big strides in this last quarter, putting out a new application thatâ€™s more mobile friendly, itâ€™s easier and to accurately enter all the income sources that helps educate consumers about the value of co-applicants; it has an enhanced calculator"
266,"Some of these things that weâ€™re doing, theyâ€™re going to be product teams and things that we continue to work on"
267,"In other words, there isnâ€™t an end in sight"
268,We need to continue to evolve and we can continue to make them better
269,"So, some of these things, online appraisals, I think thatâ€™s one that will continue to evolve, even when we have it rolled that everywhere, it doesnâ€™t"
270,mean weâ€™re done
271,"So, I think there is a lot of different things that weâ€™re working on that will provide both, near-term, mid-term and long-term results for the organization"
272,"So, as weâ€™ve said all along, weâ€™re going to open up between 13 and 16 stores, this year weâ€™re doing 15 stores"
273,Weâ€™ve said weâ€™re pleased with how all of our new stores are performing; theyâ€™re meeting our internal growth rate
274,"Outside of that, there is not a lot of color to add"
275,Iâ€™m sorry
276,I think what we said over time is you think about 200 to 300;
277,"200, you can obviously drop from the equation; I think 300 still a good target to think about"
278,"But itâ€™s -- I canâ€™t tell you what the end game is going to be, because the customersâ€™ expectations are continuing to change, our business changes, continues to evolve; weâ€™re looking at different things"
279,Weâ€™ve got a lot going on in the digital space
280,"So, I donâ€™t know where the cap is"
281,I also donâ€™t think that we found a 100% of our store delivery methods
282,We probably have some things and ways to reach customers that we donâ€™t reach them today
283,"So, itâ€™s really hard to put a high-end number on what that could be"
284,Yes
285,"Like I said, earlier, Seth, we, believe or not, we havenâ€™t had a whole bunch of, even like with Katrina"
286,", we didnâ€™t have any stores down in that market"
287,"So, we havenâ€™t had a lot of experience there"
288,"I think the last time, we cited something was again back with Wilma and Rita"
289,and we did see an impact on extra sales from that
290,"But like said earlier, weâ€™re prepared, if there are going to be incremental sales coming in for replacement vehicles, then, we will be prepared to service those customers"
291,And weâ€™ll talk about it -- weâ€

299,I think itâ€™s going to be higher end of mid-single-digits for this year
300,And depending on how much progress we make this year and what opportunities we see out there will dictate what we do next year
