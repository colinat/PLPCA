1,"Good morning, everyone"
2,"With regards to sales mix by finance channel, CAF net penetration decreased modestly to 44.2%, compared to 45% in last yearâ€™s third quarter, Tier 2 represented 15.4% of sales compared to 17% in last yearâ€™s third quarter, Tier 3 from third parties grew to 10.8% of used unit sales compared to 9.7% last year and similar to prior periods this year, sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing also increased relative to last yearâ€™s third quarter"
3,The allocation of sales across our lending channels was for the most part driven by the mix of credit applications
4,We continued to see growth in applications across the credit spectrum
5,It was more pronounced at the higher and the lower ends
6,"Also, we did observe some weakness from one of our lenders in the Tier 2 space"
7,"For CAF, net loans originated in the quarter rose 8.6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion"
8,"This was due to CarMaxâ€™s sales growth and an increase in the average amount financed, partially offset by the lower penetration"
9,"CAF income increased 15% to $102.8 million, driven by a 10.4% growth in average managed receivables and a lower loss provision, which was partially offset by slight compression in the portfolio interest margin"
10,"Total portfolio interest margin was 5.7% of average managed receivables, compared to 5.8% in both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year"
11,"For loans originated during the quarter, the weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.7%, compared to 7.3% a year ago and 7.6% in the second quarter"
12,"The ending allowance for loan losses was $128 million or 1.11% of ending manage receivables, up slightly from 1.10% in the third quarter of last year, but down sequentially from 1.15% in Q2 of this year"
13,"Now, Iâ€™ll turn to corporate finance items"
14,"As you probably noticed in the release, we experienced a reduction in our effective tax rate"
15,The tax provision was positively impacted by $8.7 million in Q3.
16,This relates to our adoption this year of the new FASB guidance regarding share-based compensation
17,"The new standard requires the impact of share-based awards settlements to be reflected in the tax rate, whereas before it ran through shareholdersâ€™ equity"
18,We expected this would introduce volatility to our tax rate and this is the first quarter where it has been significant
19,"In regard to capital structure, during the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $107 million"
20,Thatâ€™s down from last quarterâ€™s pace as you would expect based on the stock price during the quarter
21,"Before I turn the call back over to Bill, Iâ€™ll comment briefly on tax reform and its anticipated impact on CarMax"
22,Our federal tax picture is pretty straight forward
23,So we would expect the substantially lower corporate tax rate to benefit our financial results and cash flow in future periods
24,"We are evaluating the magnitude of the benefit, now that the legislation has been finalized and is awaiting the Presidentâ€™s signature"
25,"Additionally, in the period of enactment, which we expect to be our fourth quarter, we will be required to revalue our deferred tax asset based on our estimated new tax rate"
26,We believe this would result in a one-time unfavorable impact on our tax provision of an estimated $50 million to $65 million
27,This range could be impacted by our analysis of final law and our fourth quarter financial results
28,"Now, Iâ€™ll turn the call back over to Bill"
29,"The subprime, Sharon?"
30,I donâ€
31,"™t know if excited is the right word, because we are obviously more concerned about the denominator and overall growth would be best for us"
32,But I can give you a little bit of color on the subprime
33,"As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw the volume of customer applications being strongest at the highest and lowest ends"
34,"So, I think, at least in our system that says that more customers at that low end are applying for credit than we have seen in the past"
35,"And another piece of puzzle from the perspective of the subprime penetration is, we have seen this quarter and in some last quarter as well an uptick in their conversion of the applications that they see, meaning conversion to sale"
36,So thereâ€™s been a modest uptick in the performance of those subprime lenders
37,"I donâ€™t know how that persists, but obviously, after a period where we saw them declining several quarters ago, itâ€™s encouraging"
38,"Mike, we can add a little color to that also"
39,"If you look back at our growth plans and our history, capital availability has not been a gaining factor for us in our decisions regarding growth and investing in our strategic initiatives"
40,We are at the pace that we are at because we want to make sure that we can execute successfully on the growth and that we have the bandwidth to focus on innovation
41,So thatâ€™s always going to play into our thinking with regard to our pace of growth and how fast we move on things as well
42,"Hi, Brian"
43,"I -- hey, Scot"
44,"I am -- I canâ€™t really talk about what we are going to see in the following quarter, because it hasnâ€™t happened yet"
45,"But I can give you a little color, Tier 2 and Tier 3 overall, thereâ€™s"
46,a number of things that have been going on here
47,"The volume that Tier 2 you are seeing has been much more flattish, as I said, since the growth of applications has been more pronounced at the high and low end"
48,So thatâ€™s planning it a little bit on the Tier 2.
49,"And then, as I did mentioned, we have a lender that has"
50,-- had a significant pullback
51,In the Tier 2 space we expected that every lender we are partnering with is going to bring some incremental value to the table
52,"So if we see some weakness in one of the lenders, the incremental value that that lender is -- has been providing is likely to trickle down to Tier 3 and see them, and probably, have a little bit less conversion there"
53,So we would expect that we are feeling some impact on sales
54,And it -- itâ€™s an issue that has been percolating for the last several quarters
55,I canâ€™t really say how long itâ€™s going to be
56,"But the conversion in Tier 2 is down a little bit, because of that"
57,"and then so for a combination of the volume, the conversion and that one particular lender, I think, Tier 2 is a little bit is weaker than it has been historically"
58,"And conversely, we are seeing Tier 3 up a bit, because their performance has been a little bit stronger, and I think, we are seeing some trickle down from Tier 2 into that space, that we wouldnâ€™t have otherwise seen"
59,"Hi, Seth"
60,Yeah
61,"Iâ€™ll speak to that, Brian"
62,"I mean, if you look at the CAF income picture from kind of a big picture perspective, receivables are up 10.4% in the portfolio, thatâ€™s the combination of what we are originating, whatâ€™s -- and what is rolling off"
63,Our interest margin contributions are only up 8.8%
64,So we are still seeing a bit of compression in that
65,"But as we are growing the portfolio, the loss provision is lower by $4.4 million this year and thatâ€™s really reflection of last year we were in an environment of escalating losses"
66,"So, not only were we missing our booked expectations, but we were building the provisions for expectation of higher losses"
67,And this year in all three quarters we have been generally in line with our expectations
68,"So that -- I think itâ€™s pretty straightforward how the environment has evolved, like, where it goes from here"
69,", I am not sure"
70,"With regard to us versus others, I can only speak to what we are seeing in our system and the performance of our partner lenders, and as I mentioned in the Tier 3 space, weâ€™ve seen some improvement in conversion of the applications that they see"
71,"And I could also remind you that back when we saw the subprime part of our business start to decline, we were --"
72,we -- other people were not seeing the same thing at that time either
73,But I donâ€
74,™t know if weâ€™re bellwether
75,or we just run a little bit differently than what youâ€™re hearing elsewhere
