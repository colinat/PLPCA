0,Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone
1,"As youâ€™ve seen from our press release, weâ€™re off to a solid start to our fiscal 2018."
2,"Total sales from continuing operations were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12.9%"
3,"Same restaurant sales grew 1.7% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.99, an increase of 12.5% from last yearâ€™s diluted net earnings per share"
4,"Iâ€™m pleased with our same restaurant sales growth of 1.7% considering the overall industry performance along with the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which Rick will quantify during his remarks"
5,Olive Gardenâ€™s business remained strong
6,"Same restaurant sales grew 1.9% and we were pleased with these results, particularly given a change to the marketing calendar which resulted in one less promotion in the quarter"
7,"These results outperformed the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 490 basis points"
8,This was Olive Gardenâ€™s 12th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth
9,Olive Garden continues to maintain a significant gap to the industry as we drive frequency among our most loyal guests
10,"Our core menu and promotional strategy are successfully working together to create value, and our restaurant operatorsâ€™ focus on flawless execution of the basics continues to drive all-time high guest satisfaction scores"
11,Convenience remains a focus area
12,"Weâ€™re making meaningful progress, improving our to-go processes to handle increased volume, enhancing IT support, and redesigning our to-go stations to improve the guest experience"
13,"Overall, to-go sales increased 12% in the quarter"
14,"In addition, we ran our Buy One Take One promotion during the quarter, which guests view as the ultimate convenience"
15,Longhorn Steakhouse had a solid quarter
16,"Same restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 560 points"
17,This was Longhornâ€™s 18th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth
18,"The investments we have been making in our food and service over the last two years are contributing to industry-leading guest satisfaction scores, which is driving our outperformance"
19,"Additionally, we are seeing strong same restaurant sales growth in our newer markets as guests discover Longhornâ€™s value proposition"
20,This upward sales trend in newer markets is consistent with past performance of the brand
21,The Longhorn team is relentlessly focused on enhancing the guest experience
22,"We will continue to invest in food quality, look for additional ways to simplify operations, and leverage Longhornâ€™s unique culture to enable strong sales growth"
23,"Turning to Cheddarâ€™s, we continue to make good progress on the integration"
24,The planning process is behind us and we are now focused on execution
25,We are making significant non guest-facing changes over the next year which we know will have an impact on our restaurant teams
26,It will take time for the restaurant managers and team members to familiarize themselves with our systems and processes
27,"Iâ€™m confident they will master these new tools, which will help improve performance over time"
28,"Same restaurant sales for the quarter outperformed the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, but declined 1.4%"
29,"Cheddarâ€™s is heavily penetrated in Texas, and they were impacted more by Hurricane Harvey than Darden overall"
30,"Also, during the quarter we exercised our right of first refusal to acquire the 11 restaurants owned by the Cheddarâ€™s franchisee in Georgia as well as the development rights they held for Cheddarâ€™s in Georgia and Alabama"
31,"This transaction, which closed on August 28, gives us the opportunity to enhance our presence in two states that we believe will have strong growth opportunities for the Cheddarâ€™s brand"
32,Now Iâ€™ll turn it over to Rick
33,Thanks Rick
34,"I want to take a moment to thank the teams in both our restaurants and our restaurant support center that have worked tirelessly over the past month dealing with Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana and Hurricane Irma in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas"
35,"Both storms had a devastating impact on numerous communities that are home to our guests, team members and restaurants"
36,"In the field, our restaurant teams did a tremendous job of getting our restaurants that had to close back open again, and our teams here at the support center provided outstanding support before, during and after the storm hit"
37,This ensured we were prepared to deal with the impact operationally while helping our team members in need and the communities we serve
38,"Additionally, our thoughts go out to the citizens of Puerto Rico and Mexico City, as well as our franchise partners in these communities, who are still dealing with the impacts of Hurricane Maria and the earthquake that took place last week"
39,I am very proud of the response from everyone across Darden
40,"Moments like these, as difficult as they are, highlight the strength of our culture and what makes our people, our restaurants and our brand so special"
41,"With that, weâ€™ll take your questions"
42,Question-and-Answer Session
43,"Okay, good morning, Brett"
44,"Thereâ€™s seven questions, I think, in there, but great way to frame that up as one question"
45,"Let me start with Olive Garden, because I think thatâ€™s where everybody wants me to start, then Iâ€™ll make some comments on the overall environment"
46,Iâ€™m super excited about the quarter we put up in Olive Garden
47,I think the focus ought to be on the improvement in margins
48,I thought we had sales growth
49,"We ran one less promotion during the quarter, which in our effort to simplify our operations we thought was a really smart move"
50,"It eliminates one all-team meeting, it eliminated bringing in extra product"
51,Weâ€™re lengthening the time we run our promotions
52,Weâ€™re trying to re-energize them during the middle of the promotion
53,I thought it was incredibly effective
54,We had a lot less targeted digital incentives in the marketplace
55,"We made a major change to our strongest traffic driver, which is soup, salad, and breadsticks at $5.99, and we moved that to $6.99 which drove less traffic, however was significantly more profitable"
56,"So I think everybody needs to focus on the 7% growth in operating income in Olive Garden at a segment profit level, just absolutely impressive when you think about the size of this system and the performance of the overall category"
57,The other thing Iâ€™d add on the Olive Garden
58,is the traffic gap was greater than the sales gap as we continued to under-price inflation and
59,we think weâ€™re under-pricing our competitors to improve value
60,"Lastly on Olive Garden, I would just say that the team is doing an incredible job"
61,"Theyâ€™re just running better restaurants today - our throughput is up, our satisfaction is up, our engagement with team members is up"
62,"So when I put this quarter in perspective for Olive Garden, it was short of a target that the analyst community put out there, but we didnâ€™t put that sales target out there, and if you take the last three days out of the quarter, we would have been at 2%,"
63,so Iâ€™m thrilled
64,"As far as the overall environment goes, it was a choppy quarter"
65,"We had a lot of activity around storms, we had a holiday switch with the Fourth of July - just a lot of noise in the quarter"
66,I would say the environment feels fairly good
67,The consumer is there with the right offer
68,"Value has never been more important and value, depending on where you play and where your price point is, can be derived through different things"
69,"I think at Longhorn, weâ€™re deriving value with increasing the quality and improving our service; Olive Garden, weâ€™re playing a little bit more around with price to get that value across, so I think people are offering strong value consistently and provide it every day"
70,I go back to looking at our Olive Garden menu at lunch
71,"- all the price points are $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, $9.99, and I believe that weâ€™ve got great value out there with an abundance in portion"
72,"As far as pricing, Rick, I think that you can answer the pricing question"
73,"Brian, I think about it very sequentially, and right now youâ€™"
74,re right-
75,we are laser focused on integrating Cheddarâ€™s
76,"We think Cheddarâ€™s is an incredible opportunity for long-term growth, and so we are not even contemplating or thinking about doing anything else until that brand is fully integrated, it is firing and has really a good growth platform where itâ€™s contributing at a much higher growth rate than Olive Garden and to add to our overall growth rate, so thatâ€™s the focus"
77,"Once we have visibility that that has been done successfully, then weâ€™ll look at the platform and determine what our next move is"
78,"Yes, you know, we saw a good 12% growth in the quarter on a four-year run rate of approximately 70%"
79,We are starting to really think about this as a separate kind of business
80,Dave and the team are making some great changes
81,We think technology can continue to help
82,"We know in our higher volume restaurants that we need to build more space to handle the volume, and weâ€™ve done a few of those remodels with a lot of success"
83,"As long as the consumer demand is there for this product, I think we can grow it, continue to grow it close to double digits"
84,"Now, when the percentages are--itâ€™s getting harder to grow at double digits because the denominator is much higher than what it was when we first started, but I still think this is a growth driver for us"
85,"The consumer satisfaction of our to-go product is extremely high, and thatâ€™s one thing that our team is really, really focused on, is how do we make the experience better for the consumer, and the repeat business and the loyalty inside a to-go is also very high"
86,"Yes, I think to-go is growing organically in the other businesses because the consumer wants it"
87,"However, the big opportunity for to-go in Olive Garden is the bulk meals and being able to do a tray of lasagna or a pan of fettuccine Alfredo"
88,We just donâ€™t have that
89,"We have a little bit of that in Bahama Breeze - weâ€™ve got some products that we do some large party stuff on, but we really think about the other mass brand, Olive Garden"
90,"Itâ€™s really growing with the consumer demand and itâ€™s a nice piece of business, but it will never have the same opportunity as Olive Garden does because of the bulk size and really the business piece"
91,"No, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s not proving more difficult"
92,"We knew that this--we knew that this had been under-invested in and that the systems were lacking, that there wasnâ€™t much to work with, and so in our past acquisitions weâ€™ve had to change systems,"
93,"here weâ€™re implementing systems that never were there, which makes it a little bit different"
94,"But when you think about the magnitude of this and none of the integration has really started - itâ€™s starting in the next couple weeks for the most part, all-new distribution, food, small wares"
95,"Weâ€™ve got a new HR system thatâ€™s going in the first of the year, weâ€™ve got an all-new POS thatâ€™s starting to go in"
96,Every back office system is going to be new
97,These restaurants donâ€™t have KDS
98,"Seventy percent of the restaurants still have a ticket, just one ticket coming into the kitchen, they donâ€"
99,™t even have remote printers
100,"I havenâ€™t worked in an environment where we havenâ€™t had remote printers since the 1980s, so thereâ€™s a lot of work to be done here"
101,"Weâ€™ve got great management out there, itâ€™s just a lot for them to take in, and we know through our past history with integrations that these become distractions and youâ€™re not as focused on the basics of the business"
102,"So Iâ€™m pleased with where weâ€™re at, thereâ€™s just a lot of work to do"
103,"Yes, our guidance anticipates the performance the way theyâ€™re performing right now and the synergies weâ€™ve already talked about"
104,"David, one other thing and for everybody on Cheddarâ€™s is that we are doing multiple integrations"
105,"As you remember, they purchased their largest franchisee prior to us purchasing them, which is making that part of it more complicated"
106,"We are also in Cheddarâ€™s starting to run negative check average as we standardize the menus across the system, and we believe this is--this was not something in our calculus, but we think this is the right thing to do for the business, is to standardize all these menus and processes and procedures"
107,"The largest franchisee that we acquired, what we refer to as the Grier restaurants, are running negative check because of this standardization"
108,No
109,We actually--we donâ€™t think that that had a major impact on it
110,"We do think the lack of TDIs may have had an impact on the top line, but it significantly helped the bottom line"
111,I think thatâ€™s dynamic
112,"I think that we look at having a toolkit of levers that we can pull, depending on whatâ€™s happening in the external environment and maybe good our top line promotional activity is"
113,"Just a reminder to everybody, weâ€™re out there with three levels of media - weâ€™ve got a promotional media message, we have a secondary message out there, and then we have a lunch or a catering business, the business-type message out there"
114,We continue to transition to more online video as we learn more about that
115,"and we become more effective, and so weâ€™re going to continue to play with the media mix to try to optimize traffic and profitability, but it is dependent on whatâ€™s happening in the marketplace"
116,"Thatâ€™s what we really love about the Olive Garden business, is that we have a lot of levers to pull"
117,"As we think about going forward, everything is factored into our guidance"
118,"On the beef front, no, not necessarily"
119,"As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we still expect commodity inflation to be between flat and 1%, and based on where we are today, we still think that number makes sense"
120,"Yes, thatâ€™s all included in the guidance"
121,Weâ€™ve taken in whatâ€™s happened in the last couple weeks and included that in the guidance going forward
122,"You know, as we think about what we guided, we feel really confident in the 438 to 450 that we mentioned"
123,"As we see more of whatâ€™s been going on with the hurricanes and the impact that we said the hurricanes have, including cost saves that weâ€™re doing for the year, we feel really good about the 438 to 450."
124,"Yes, first clarification"
125,- Buy One Take
126,One does not get into the to-go numbers at all
127,"Thatâ€™s an in-restaurant promotion, although itâ€™s the ultimate convenience because the consumer gets to take a to-go meal home with that, but thatâ€™s all logged in restaurant"
128,"Part of what weâ€™re doing from an incentive standpoint on the to-go is we think itâ€™s an area we need to remind the consumer we do that in a cost effective way, and itâ€™s incredibly valuable for us to be able to engage a new consumer because through to-go, we pick up a tremendous amount of personal information that helps us market more effectively to that person, so weâ€™ll continue to use promotional activity, and we feel the margin structure is fairly strong because especially we get them to engage online"
129,We think that this is somewhat incremental
130,These are different visits
131,These takeout visits are different
132,I donâ€
133,™t think people sit home and decide whether theyâ€™re going to eat in restaurant or theyâ€™re going to eat
134,takeout - theyâ€™ve decided they want to have a takeout experience and
135,"therefore theyâ€™re using Olive Garden for that, so again we go back to what weâ€™re trying to do in Olive Garden"
136,Weâ€™re trying to feed our most loyal guests where and when they want Olive Garden food
137,"Well, I think when we looked at it, it was just a cross promotion with Coca Cola"
138,"Every year, we have so marketing dollars to use with Coca Cola, and it was a way for us to do a cross promotion with them that I thought was a value add without having to use dollar discounts"
139,"Longhornâ€™s overall TDIs for the quarter were down, their incentives were down, so I feel good about--you know"
140,"I do think just in fairness to the way you guys are counting how we do the TDIs, youâ€™ve got to be careful because a lot of those TDIs are exploding offers that are very short in nature and weâ€™re trying to stimulate traffic"
141,"I think on Longhorn, the burger and a Coke one, I thought that was a great offer"
142,We have to figure a way to market lunch as effectively as we can because we know the big negative trade down if we trade a dinner into lunch from the margin standpoint
143,"really hurts us,"
144,so weâ€™ve got to come up with creative ways to keep lunch fresh
145,"At Longhorn, I thought that was actually the best lunch promotion they ran all quarter"
146,"Both the Cheddarâ€™s acquisitions, the one done before we purchased Cheddarâ€™s corporate and the one that we did at the end of the quarter, were rights of first refusal"
147,Weâ€™re not actively in the marketplace trying to repurchase our franchisees
148,We want to be a great franchisor
149,"We want to make our franchisees as successful as they possibly can; however, when the opportunity arose to buy especially the CMP franchise, we wanted that territory back, we wanted to control that territory - itâ€™s one that we knew, and we were able to buy that on very, very good terms"
150,"Well first of all, the impact of buying CMP is pretty immaterial for this fiscal year, and after that thereâ€™s, I think, only 14 restaurants that are franchised, so there arenâ€™t many big franchisees left, and all of those impacts would be contemplated in the guidance that we gave"
151,"Yes Jason, I think I missed your first question -"
152,"oh, the to-go mix?"
153,Weâ€™re not breaking that out at this point in time
154,"Weâ€™re giving you the overall percentage growth, but weâ€™re not getting into whatâ€™s coming from catering and whatâ€™s coming from third party, so on and so forth"
155,"As far as the overall environment, I continue to look at the stronger players that I think are well positioned, who have good value equations"
156,They continue to take market share
157,"I think I said in the last call that if you took out the bottom 25% of the indexes, the players that are pretty weak, you have flat to slightly--a little bit of growth in those benchmarks, but at the end of the day it keeps coming back to thereâ€™s a lot of competition for the discretionary dollar, and weâ€™ve got to fight not just amongst ourselves to provide value to the guests but weâ€™ve got to provide value against other options for them to spend their discretionary income"
158,"I think itâ€™s a total focus on value, and I think that gets back into our strategy, which is to use our scale and our platform to our advantage, under-price inflation and under-price our competitors, and operate better to create a better value equation for our guests, and I think thatâ€™s what we continue to do"
159,I expect the environment to pretty much stay the same in the foreseeable future
160,"John, weâ€™re in test with multiple vendors to see how this is going to play out"
161,Itâ€™s in the early stages
162,"Weâ€™re trying to learn, weâ€™re trying to understand what the check average is"
163,"Weâ€™re trying to understand how good these third parties can execute, because thatâ€™s a big part"
164,"The consumerâ€™s perception is always going to be the supplier, not the person thatâ€™s in the middle delivering the product thatâ€™s going to get blamed for good product, cold product,"
165,"product thatâ€™s been shaken or whatever, so weâ€™re going slow with this"
166,Weâ€™re analyzing it
167,Itâ€™s
168,a unique opportunity
169,"Letâ€™s see whether this is a phase or a fad, and weâ€™re positioned to continue to analyze it"
170,"I mean, one of the options is doing it ourselves"
171,Weâ€™re not
172,"sure we want to go there, but weâ€™ll continue to figure this out"
173,Thereâ€™s too many players in this space right now for it to work
174,"Thereâ€™s not enough profit for the third party people to survive, and so weâ€™ve just got to let this whole thing play out, and"
175,"right now I think our focus is on a bigger pie, which is B2B and B2C at over $100."
176,"Yes, we have a test going on right now with that, to see how that works and for us to really analyze to make sure that thereâ€™s enough profit for the effort and understanding the risk"
177,"I mean, you have to remember for Olive Garden, the majority of our restaurants are in suburban neighborhoods where thereâ€™s not a lot of desire for this"
178,This is an urban concept - itâ€™s not New York or Boston or whatever
179,"In Omaha, thereâ€™s no desire for this on a large scale"
180,"I mean, youâ€™re not driving into suburbia"
181,"In some of these places, not even Uberâ€™s cars drive around, so letâ€™s"
182,--we want to go slow and we want to be thoughtful about this
183,"Yes Stephen, youâ€™re right - pretty astute"
184,"We did have more closed days in the second quarter for Harvey than in the first quarter, but that we have contemplated in the double the impact of Harvey, so the Irma plus any impact of Harvey in the second quarter, including any pent-up demand that happens in Houston and other areas is all contemplated in our double the impact of Harvey in Q2."
185,"Yes, weâ€™ve been at the lower end of the long term target for growth, and I think as we build up the pipeline for new restaurants, hopefully we can slide that upward"
186,Weâ€™re very pleased with our new restaurant growth right now
187,"Weâ€™ve opened some very strong Yardhouses, Olive Garden and Longhorn"
188,Let me just clarify my comment on Longhorn and newer markets
189,"When Iâ€™m referring to these newer markets, really non-legacy markets, weâ€™ve been in these markets for three or four years"
190,"Historically, itâ€™s taken time for Longhorn to really develop a following and for people to really get the value equation, and weâ€™re really starting to see that as we continue to grow, so thatâ€™s whatâ€™s really driving the same restaurant sales growth"
191,"When you look at the Longhorn footprint, thereâ€™s not much room - these are small, small buildings, so 6,000 square feet, some of them are closer to 5,000, and you get great average unit volumes out of Florida and Atlanta"
192,"You donâ€™t have a lot of growth, so if youâ€™re going to get same restaurant sales growth,"
193,theyâ€™ve got to come from some of these newer markets that opened a little bit slower
194,One other thing on the long term framework
195,"When we talk about our 2% to 3% over a longer period of time, we are considering acquisitions in that, and so adding our new Cheddarâ€™s restaurants to that has a big push in this fiscal year, but think about what the impact is of that over a five-year horizon"
196,Sure
197,"On the labor dollars per restaurant, yes, a big impact of that is Cheddarâ€™s"
198,"If you think about their AUVs or average AUVs for Darden, that $4.5 million with higher labor as a percent of sales, and we did have some labor inflation, so that did drive labor costs on a per-restaurant basis up a little bit, but it was probably 50/50."
199,"In regards to the impact to Olive Garden or the CPG shift, it was 20 basis points to Olive Garden, 20 basis point improvement in margin to Olive Garden"
200,"Weâ€™re talking about less than a couple million dollars, maybe, in a quarter on CPG sales"
201,"No, I think itâ€™s going at the right pace"
202,Iâ€™m thrilled with some of these markets
203,"When youâ€™re busting in as a third or fourth steakhouse in a trade area, people have to have a reason to try you, and you have to work the Longhorn menu a little bit to really understand the value"
204,"We tried to move that along through different processes, different marketing campaigns, but history tells us itâ€™s just time"
205,"Over time, Longhorn has a pretty good growth spurt, and many of these markets--you know, we donâ€™t have a lot of penetration"
206,Thereâ€™s no TV in those markets
207,"Itâ€™s just something thatâ€™s been organic for the brand for the last 20 years, and Iâ€™m thrilled with it because I know thereâ€™s great value in Longhorn"
208,"Yes, weâ€™re making great progress"
209,Weâ€™ve got 116 done to date - 23 were completed in the first quarter
210,We expect to do almost another 100 in fiscal â€™18.
211,"I do think that number, we didnâ€™t look at that number after the two storms"
212,"You can only imagine that there is some labor shortage out there from that skill set, so we donâ€"
213,"™t know how thatâ€™s going to be impacted, but weâ€™ve got plans to do a lot more in the back half of the year"
214,"For the past 20 years, weâ€™ve looked at different ways to run our dining rooms"
215,Some of our businesses use runners; some of our businesses donâ€™t use runners
216,"At the end of the day, trying to cut back labor that is dedicated to taking care of your guests is not a smart move, and we will continue to improve and try to enhance the service that weâ€™re providing our guests"
217,"So we believe in three-table stations, when weâ€™re really busy"
218,"we have runners behind them, but we are focused on trying to improve the service, and we talk a lot about it at Darden"
219,", we want to put the full back into full service"
220,"Yes, itâ€™s a big part of the synergies that weâ€™ve given you"
221,Itâ€™s
222,"probably half of it just getting on our platform, so"
223,"the timing, I think it starts next week or the week after"
224,Hopefully itâ€™s going to be seamless
225,"They have to order differently than what they have in the past, with a little bit more of an electronic ordering process"
226,"They probably might have to think out a day further ahead than they had in the past, so there is some operational complexity there, but this is a big part of putting anybody on our platform"
227,"We work extremely hard to ensure that our supply chain is efficient as it possibly can be, and this is a big part of us getting our synergies"
228,"Yes, we didnâ€™t specifically point out what the commodity inflation was in the first quarter"
229,"We did say that for the year, itâ€™s zero to 1%, and the commodity inflation in the first quarter was within that range, so it was inflationary where in the past we were deflationary"
230,Wage inflation
231,", we said it was at the high end of our 3% to 4%, so assume around 4%"
232,"You know, weâ€™ve been seeing this wage inflation roughly around the 3% to 4% range for a while, and we donâ€"
233,™t see anything on the horizon that says that is going to come down
234,"That said, we have the industry leading turnover, so weâ€™re able to offset some of the wage inflation by spending our time training our folks to get better and to be more effective and more efficient than maybe training somebody to learn our systems, so we think that helps our productivity in the long run"
235,"You know, I think we have levers to pull and are nimble enough to compete effectively in any type of environment"
236,"If the environment was a little bit better, maybe weâ€™d take a little more price"
237,I think that weâ€™ll continue to compete effectively
238,"The loyalty between both Longhorn and Olive Garden with our guests, and especially Olive Garden, what Olive Garden means to the American cultural fabric is just incredible"
239,"I mean, we just did the pasta fast promotion - the amount of participation in that, the amount of comments that were posted, the amount of press coverage, Olive Garden is an important brand in American society, and I think itâ€™s going to compete effectively now and for a long period of time"
240,"Yes, overall quarter to quarter we were flat; however, service did tick up"
241,"I think about the drivers of that, weâ€™ve got to continue to simplify the operation"
242,"These are very high volume, complex restaurants, and the more simplicity that the team can bring to it, and you think about just doing one less promotion inside that last quarter, that improved our--you know, that simplified things for the restaurant managers dramatically by not having to do one more rollout"
243,So thatâ€™s what weâ€™re
244,"really focused on, is the simplicity of it, and hopefully that will continue to lead to better execution"
245,"Was there a second question there, Peter, I missed?"
246,"Yes, value scores have ticked up just a little bit"
247,"I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s significant, but they are already fairly high"
248,"When you do come off your TDIs a little bit, your value is going to take a little bit of a hit too, but I look at--you know, you canâ€™t look at one metric"
249,You have to look at all the metrics together to inform you to make good decisions
250,"If youâ€™re just trying to get one metric, I hate to use a sports analogy, but"
251,it doesnâ€™t matter
252,how many first downs you get in a football game
253,"Youâ€™ve got to put the most points up on the board, so weâ€™ve got a lot of data coming in"
254,We think weâ€™ve got a competitive advantage here
255,"We look at all that data and that helps inform us to make decisions that we think are good for the long term for that specific business, not whatâ€™s good for the first quarter or for the quarter that weâ€™re in, whatâ€™s good for the long term"
