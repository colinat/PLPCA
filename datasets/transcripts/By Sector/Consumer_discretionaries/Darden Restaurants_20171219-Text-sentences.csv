0,Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone
1,Let me start by saying Iâ€™m very pleased of our performance during the quarter
2,Our teams did a great job managing through some difficult circumstances recovering from the hurricanes
3,"Total sales from continued operations were 1.88 billion, an increase of 14.6%"
4,"Same restaurant sales grew 3.1% and adjusted net earnings per share were $0.73, an increase of 14.1% from last yearâ€™s diluted net earnings per share"
5,"Given our consistent positive results, Iâ€™m more convinced than ever that our success has been driven by the strategy we implemented three years ago"
6,"Our intense focus on improving the food, service and atmosphere in our restaurants combined with relevant integrated marketing remains a winning strategy for our brands"
7,The long-term investments we have made and will continue to make and these areas are paying-off and we will work hard every day to better execute in these critical areas
8,"This back-to-basics operating philosophy is coupled with Dardenâ€™s four competitive advantages; one, leveraging our significant scale to create a cost advantage, two, using extensive data insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guests and communicate with them more effectively, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process, and four, cultivating our results oriented people culture to enable growth"
9,Together our operating philosophy and competitive advantages give me confidence in our ability to continue to deliver our long-term framework overtime
10,Turning to Olive Garden
11,Same-restaurant sales grew 3% outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 400 basis points
12,"This was Olive Gardenâ€™s 13th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth driven by our focus on simplification and flawless execution, which continues to result in high guest satisfaction scores"
13,"Our promotional strategies and core menu are working together to create everyday value, and drive increased frequency for our most loyal guests and our strong-to-go performance which grew 12%"
14,"During the quarter, we ran our two most popular value promotions,"
15,"Buy One Take One, which appeals to our guest need for convenience and Never Ending Pasta Bowl which highlights our brand pillar of never ending abundance"
16,Both promotions leveraged brand equities and were supported by strong integrated marketing campaigns highlighted by Olive Gardenâ€™s most anticipated event of the year
17,The Pasta Pass
18,"This year in addition to making 22,000 pasta passes available we introduced the first of its kind Pasta Passport which included all the benefits of the Pasta Pass plus a trip of a lifetime to Italy"
19,"Once again, all pasta passes were claimed online immediately"
20,The volume of social media and PR buzz surrounding this event illustrates the strong emotional connection our fans have with the Olive Garden
21,LongHorn Steakhouse had strong quarter as the investments we have been making for last two years are significantly improving consumer perceptions and motivating guests to visit more frequently
22,"Same restaurant sales grew 3.8%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 480 points"
23,This was LongHornâ€™s 19th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth
24,The emphasis LongHornâ€™s leadership has placed on simplification like reducing their menu items by nearly 30% has led to higher levels of execution
25,"At the same time, they continue to enhance the quality of guest experience with strategic investments in food, service and atmosphere"
26,As I mentioned last quarter same restaurant sales at LongHornâ€™s new markets continue to grow at a higher rate than in the established markets
27,"Consumers in these new markets are discovering what makes LongHorn special, while at the same time fully realizing the value proposition that inherently exists in the brand"
28,This performance trend is not new to LongHorn
29,We have seen it play out over the past 20 years as I have been associated with the brand
30,Now I will update you on the Cheddar's integration
31,The Cheddar's team is doing a great job managing the complexity of this integration which also includes integrating the two largest franchisees which were recently acquired
32,Merging three different operating systems into the Darden network isnâ€™t easy but is going exactly as planned
33,We are at an important point in the integration progress as we transition from planning to execution
34,"Integration related activity is peaking as we transition distribution networks including our main line distributor, produce suppliers and smallware suppliers, convert point of sales systems in 10 restaurants per week which also includes two weeks of training for restaurant prior to conversion, fully transition Cheddar's payroll system on to the Darden payroll platform and finally, we just completed open enrollment and Cheddarâ€™s team members will be transition to Darden benefits at the beginning of the calendar year"
35,"It is our intent to integrate Cheddarâ€™s and the two acquired franchise systems as fast as possible in order to position the brand to take advantage of the scale, synergies another benefits of Darden infrastructure"
36,"We realize this is having a short-term negative impact on sales momentum, but we believe the long-term benefit will far outweigh the short-term impact"
37,Rick will provide an update on synergies in his remarks in just a moment
38,I want to thank the integration team for this outstanding work on this project
39,They have developed a comprehensive plan and are executing that plan at high levels
40,The more we learn about Cheddarâ€™s the more excited
41,we become of the long-term growth prospects
42,"They are the undisputed value leader in casual dining with a large loyal guest base and average approximately 6,300 guests per week, per restaurant"
43,Let me close by saying the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they help our guests celebrate with co-workers family and friends
44,"On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 175,000 team members for all due to create memorable guest experiences during the special time of the year"
45,We remain focused on getting better every day
46,and I look forward to making even more progress in the new year ahead
47,And now Iâ€™ll turn it over to Rick
48,"Brett as Rick said, we are making no further comments on the pending tax legislation"
49,We will update our guidance in January once the bill is passed
50,"So, for everybody else who wants to ask as a question on it, weâ€™re not going to answer them"
51,"As far as the consumer landscape, I think you were referring to that our GAP to NAV or our GAAP to benchmarks may have shrunk a little bit and weâ€™ve been pretty clear"
52,"and we said we preferred to operate in an environment with a stronger industry and if our GAAP shrinks a little bit, thatâ€™s"
53,okay with us
54,"As I said in my prepared remarks, I think we had a great quarter considering everything that transpired, we saw strength in all our businesses, we started in a pretty big hole in September"
55,I think it feels pretty good out there
56,"I would say when I look at the benchmarks, Iâ€™m seeing about 3% growth in what the consumer is paying"
57,"So, I donâ€™t feel itâ€™s still"
58,the environment
59,all that promotional right now
60,I know they could be getting that in a couple of different ways where theyâ€™re getting it through price or mix
61,But I feel like itâ€™s fairly positive out there right now
62,and I just feel good
63,"I think the consumer is using the whole menu, theyâ€™re not all that reactive to what people are doing from an incentive standpoint"
64,Hey good morning David
65,I continue to see -- when I look over the landscape the brands that are well positioned have strong value equations are continuing to take share
66,This is approximately $100 billion category that has been growing approximately 2%
67,"And for those that are well positioned, I feel like they are going to continuing to do well"
68,"If your value propositions are little off and your offering is not resonating with the consumer, it could be a struggle"
69,I think focusing on the overall industry benchmarks is somewhat dangerous because itâ€™s been such deviation in the performance of the people that are doing well compared to the people who arenâ€™t
70,"So, I canâ€™t comment and give you guidance on what we think calendar â€˜18 might look like"
71,"Weâ€™ve given you what we think guidance is for the back half of our fiscal year, we always get a little nervous in December, January, February and March because weather is out of our control"
72,We canâ€™t control that
73,"And if we have a bad winter, that could put pressure short-term on our same restaurant sales"
74,But we donâ€™t think that has any impact on the overall momentum of the business
75,"So, as I said earlier to Brettâ€™s question, we feel pretty good about how the consumer is reacting to our brands right now"
76,A lot in there Nicole
77,Let me start with the off-price sales
78,"I take back to where, we identified a couple of years ago that the consumer needs data of convenience"
79,The consumers are still looking at that for convenience
80,Weâ€™ve got some brands that really can satisfy that express the Olive Garden
81,Weâ€™ve done a great job with that
82,"I think thatâ€™s probably, a more permanent part of our equation today"
83,I donâ€™t see that need state going away
84,", I see that need state increasing"
85,And I think weâ€™ll continue to come up with innovative way to meet that need
86,"As far as, we start thinking about delivery and as weâ€™ve said before, weâ€™ve got multiple tests going on in the marketplace, we are trying to learn"
87,We believe that someone is going to rise up and create some scale in the space and weâ€™
88,ll watch those third-party delivers
89,Weâ€™re also watching competitors that are doing it themselves
90,"We have a small test, weâ€™re doing ourselves"
91,And weâ€™ll watches whole space kind of develop
92,"And weâ€™ll decide, how weâ€™re going to participate in that"
93,We are still very attracted to the large party delivery catering in Olive Garden where average order is over $300.
94,That makes a lot more sense for us to market and pursue than running around delivering $10 entrees at this point in time
95,"So, for us, itâ€™s a wait and see"
96,"Weâ€™re very engaged in the process, where all the third-party delivery companies and weâ€™re very engaged with our own activity around that"
97,"So, to us, so what see how these things develops"
98,We have a filter that we run every decision through
99,And the first question we ask is how does our team member win if we make a decision
100,The second is how does our guest win if we make a decision
101,and we believe one of our four competitive advantages is our culture
102,"even as the employee market has tightened, our retention rates have not moved it all, they actually improved a little bit"
103,"Weâ€™ll continue to invest in our team members, we believe we have great training programs, 50% of our management comes from our team member ranks which we believe are offering growth opportunities to our team members"
104,"And I think weâ€™re doing the right thing, weâ€™re not trying to manage to when these awards were â€“ weâ€™re just doing the right thing for our team members every single day"
105,and then if we then get an award thatâ€™s great
106,"But I think you can see it in our results, weâ€™re doing a good job taken care of our guests"
107,and we take care of our guests
108,", we win"
109,"No, I donâ€"
110,"™t think, I think the exact opposite"
111,I think this is a way for people to trade in the casual dining and having an experience for under $14 -- under a $14 check average was made from scratch food that is at a higher quality than most comparable operations they are competing against
112,"We look at the data and the research, weâ€™re just really impressed with the loyalty, weâ€™ve been out doing what we call dine arounds, where our team goes out and dine with guest"
113,And we continue to learn more and more about the admiration they have for our brand
114,And the accessibility the brand provides for people who probably couldnâ€™t go out to eat in a full service casual dining environment except they can go to Cheddars and make it work inside their budget
115,"This is a very strong brand, when I think about -- I know there is a little bit of concern about where the comps are and this doesnâ€™t surprise us at all"
116,", it happened at Yardhouse, it happened at Longhorn and I believe the only -- Longhorn only ever had one negative full year of same restaurant sales decline and that was during the integration in its 30 some year history"
117,"The other thing I would add is that, weâ€™ve acquired two large franchise operations inside of Cheddar's that make up approximately 35% of the system"
118,"Those restaurants, there are 54 of them I believe or approximately 54 are a significant drag on the base Cheddar restaurants that were the real base of the company owned operations that we bought"
119,"Those restaurants are dragging it down, well over percent"
120,"As we standardize the menus, because the menus were somewhat different and their pricing philosophies were somewhat different, as weâ€™ve standardize the menus we are getting some negative check, thatâ€™s drag and it sound to"
121,These are decisions we have to make for a long-term
122,"And lastly as I mentioned in my remarks, integration is hard and we believe, when we look back on our couple of our last acquisitions, we didnâ€™t go fast enough, we let integration drag on too long"
123,"And so, we made the determination during this fund that weâ€™re going push hard and get to the other side quicker and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing"
124,"and we actually integrated the two franchise systems first,"
125,so theyâ€™ve actually had the most activity because their systems were so weak
126,And I will close up by just saying the most important thing for us to do is to get our POS systems in these restaurants so that we can start getting the data that we get to analyze our other businesses to help us make the right strategic choices as we move forward to drive this brand
127,"Letâ€™s not get hung up on short term quarter-to-quarter comps, this business does 6,300 guests a week, has incredible loyalty and is the undisputed value leader"
128,"Once we get to the other side of this which will be another 6, 9, 12 months, this business will be a good growth driver for Darden"
129,12%
130,"Yeah, I think Brian, every year we start off with a detailed plan for each of our business"
131,"The first thing that we look at it is what investments do we even make into the business, either through employee, experience into the guest and already be able to grow our market share and compete more effectively"
132,"We look at our advantages and weâ€™ve always come back to that and how do we make scale work for us and thatâ€™s really, really important and so weâ€™re not really talking about next year or next fiscal year but weâ€™re constantly looking at how do we make our experience better?"
133,I mean youâ€™re really asking me to look into a crystal ball and try to project whatâ€™s happening
134,", I mean whatâ€™s going to happen"
135,"We think our advantages and if we continue to make the right investments, whether itâ€™s underpricing and inflation, whether thatâ€™s improving the food quality, whether thatâ€™s improving the employee experience"
136,"The way we look at it how do we increase our share of the $100 billion category, both through same restaurant sales growth and new restaurant growth"
137,And we look at the value equation for each of our businesses and we look at Cheddar's and Olive garden
138,"The price value relationship is really important, as we move up the continuing [ph]"
139,the we experience becomes more important
140,"So, I am not sure -- if the overall industry does continue to improve, Iâ€™m telling you right now, weâ€™re working as hard as we possibly can to get as much of that share as possible"
141,"And however, it plays out, it plays out"
142,"But we are not all that -- we look at the benchmarks, we report them out to you guys, but we are not sure thatâ€™s always the total opportunity because we look at the top five or six players in the industry and say if theyâ€™re doing something that we ought to try to be able to beat them not just the benchmark"
143,"Well, I think the biggest thing that we constantly think about is the employee experience and how do we ensure that we have the best team members out there to bring our brands alive"
144,Great brand management is much more difficult in the restaurant space than it is in consumer-packaged goods where you just put your brand up on a shelf and you do some advertising
145,We have employees that -- team members that bring our brands to life every single day
146,"So, when I think about the investment -- if we think about investments in general, they have nothing to do with whatâ€™s going on with legislation"
147,We think about how do we improve the overall experience?
148,And the competition for team members I think is going to be the most important element moving forward
149,How do we get great team members to bring our brands to life?
150,"I mean we are not going to talk about anything that has -- you tie this to meaningful benefits of tax reform, weâ€™re not talking about anything I am sorry David, about tax reform"
151,We will talk about general investments and how we think about it
152,but I think Iâ€™ve already answered that question
153,Yes
154,Weâ€™re approximately 30% online now
155,and it continues to grow
156,And we do incentivize people to do that
157,Because we get a lot of data when they we get via online
158,"And so, thatâ€™s an important part of the process, it just helps to simplify the operation and weâ€™ll continue to try to migrate as much of that business over as possible"
159,"At the end of the day, we got a lot of people calling in orders, when they are driving home"
160,"Thatâ€™s hard to do those online, while youâ€™re driving"
161,But weâ€™ll continue with more people over the best we can
162,No
163,Let me clarify
164,Those negative two is inclusive of the two franchise systems that we -- what they call the Grier restaurants that were purchased by Cheddarâ€™s right before we bought them
165,"And then we purchased their next largest franchisee, which we refer to as a CMP shortly thereafter"
166,They make up 35% of the overall system
167,"So, in essence, weâ€™re doing 3 integrations at once and their system has grown dramatically"
168,Now what I said
169,"and maybe I wasnâ€™t clear, was that, the 35% of the restaurants that were franchised and now company owned are dragging same restaurant sales down by 100 basis points"
170,Andâ€¦ Matt Kirschner Were they in 1Q as well?
171,Yes
172,CMP wasnâ€™t just a Grier restaurant
173,"And we have negative check in the approximately 45 Grier restaurants that we brought, because we had to standardize the menu"
174,So that negative check is part of the drag
175,"And this franchise -- these are great restaurants, great people but our franchise system that was run a little bit independently of the core company"
176,owned restaurants
177,"So, there is going to some effort and energy to get them up to the operating standards of the company restaurants"
178,Matt Kirschner Completely understand
179,"So, it wouldnâ€™t be correct to compare it down 1.4 to down 2"
180,and you had a little bit of a different composite of the base?
181,"Yes, that would be correct"
182,You could do that
183,Matt Kirschner
184,Okay
185,Because the CMP restaurants are a drag
186,Matt Kirschner
187,"And then you mentioned that the middle of FY 2019, is now the target -- ahead of schedule for the integration correct?"
188,"Yeah, it is fiscal 2019."
189,"Sorry, Matt itâ€™s for the synergies not the integration"
190,"So, the integration, we expect to have most of the integration work done on the system side by the end of this fiscal year, but we do expect them to have to continue to learn how those systems works and then take those systems and use the data that we have to help improve the performance in fiscal 2019 thatâ€™s fair"
191,"Thatâ€™s where I think we were saying the integration is going to take 18 months, itâ€™s"
192,"the integration, the system is going to take less time than that, itâ€™s just the learning and the understanding the data is going to take a little longer"
193,"But we do expect that the synergies on a run-rate basis, we will get by the middle of fiscal 2019 versus the run-rate basis we thought will be at the end of fiscal 2019."
194,"So, sorry messed up the question there"
195,Matt Kirschner
196,"So, I guess if everything is moving forward, would it be correct to assume that potentially you could be looking to reaccelerate growth of the Cheddarâ€™s brand or bring it back to a little bit more meaningful growth perhaps sooner than maybe what you would have thought"
197,say six months ago?
198,"Matt, just because the integration is going a little bit faster, itâ€™s still takes time to find sites and other things and when youâ€™ve got a site pipeline that could be 18 months, it will take us a little longer just to rebuild that pipeline"
199,"We do expect to open restaurants in FY 2019, and weâ€™ll talk about the number of openings et cetera when we give you the fiscal 2019 outlook"
200,But itâ€™s just going to take us a little while to build up that pipeline
201,"Again, using the data that we use to help find the greater site"
202,"So, I would still expect us to open restaurants at least at the pace that weâ€™re opening them today in fiscal 2019, but weâ€™ll tell you more about that when we talk in 2019."
203,Matt Kirschner Understood
204,"And then last question, is there anything that you wanted tell us about the hurricanes as far as on the cost structure, did they impair, did you have any waste of food in the quarter that should be noted or called out that was meaningful to the margins or disparity in same store sales as far as recovering happening a little maybe regionally seeing a little bit of stronger strength in pockets"
205,Or is it pretty much a -- or everything that you reported is sort of national trends?
206,"Matt, thanks for that"
207,"What happened for the quarter, when we originally talked about the quarter we thought it would be down 60 basis points in the same restaurant sales and down $0.035 in - or $0.03 Iâ€™m sorry in EPS"
208,"What it turned out was the restaurants that we had in Florida, impacted and they were closed for quite a while"
209,so that impacted us in total by about 50 basis points in close days
210,And those are higher volume restaurants in the system average
211,But then we did get some bounce back in Florida
212,"And so, each brand was impacted differently, but for the company for Darden it was slightly negative in comps for the entire quarter"
213,"So, it wasnâ€™t negative 60 basis points, itâ€™s was just slightly negative"
214,"On an EPS basis, it turned out to be about $0.02 unfavorable instead of $0.03, because the comp impact wasn't as bad"
215,"Now, the $0.02 is primarily proactive things that we did to make sure that the restaurants were boarded up and so they were -- they didnâ€™t have any as much damage"
216,"We did have some food inventory write-off, we had some restaurants that were closed maybe a week"
217,and so that food has to be written-off
218,But weâ€™re also very proactive before the hurricanes come to help mitigate any food write-off
219,"So again, it was about $0.02 for the quarter instead of three and it was about slightly negative in comp instead of 0.6."
220,Alright
221,"So, letâ€™s start with Olive Garden, the 12% quarter I thought was I think is a really strong To Go quarter"
222,We think about the future; the consumer need state is going to continue -- is going to need to continue to increase for the convenience for us to continue to growth that
223,Weâ€™re doing well over $0.5 million on average inside an Olive Garden box and To Go weâ€™ve got restaurants that are doing well over $1 million To Go
224,"So, as we think about going in into the future, you know we need consumer needs state to continue to grow"
225,Weâ€™ll continue to innovative
226,"I think one of the biggest things we can do on Olive Garden to Go is improve our operations as the business has improved, Dave and Dan and the team continue to work on coming up with better systems to handle the volume"
227,It's actually an interesting business because I do a lot of pickups like at 11:15 and 11:30.
228,And so they can use the [indiscernible] before it fills up to handle the volume
229,"So, I think there is some operational improvements that we can make"
230,We can continue to improve the offering to stay relevant to the guest and continue to remind the guest that its available
231,We have said -- weâ€™re publicly on the record saying that we think overtime if the consumer need state continues to grow that this can be 20% of our business
232,Primarily because the type of food travels so well
233,and we can do it more so than just entrees that we can do bulk and bulk
234,is where we want to be
235,"Let me move to LongHorn, weâ€™ve been making great investments in LongHorn for the last two years, Todd and his team has done a great job of -- weâ€™ve increased the size of the stakes, weâ€™ve removed complexity in the kitchen and as weâ€™ve mentioned weâ€™ve taken the SKUs down, some of that through the menu, some of that through the promotional activity that weâ€™ve done, reducing the number of new items that we introduced on a quarterly basis"
236,"And what weâ€™re finding is we had a lot of stuff on menu items on our menu that really were duplicative and what the feeling -- the need they were feeling for the consumer, and we removed them and it just helps us operate much more efficiently"
237,"I believe all our businesses, all our brands, our menus are too complicated, too complex, we have items that continue to work and do the same thing over and over and over again versus having one great fried appetizer instead of having three great fried appetizers"
238,"And the more we can simplify the operation, the better the execution gets, the quality increases and the overall value the consumer is having an impact"
239,And LongHorn historically has been a high food cost low labor cost operation
240,And we have simplified that operation to be able to bring the labor cost down and increase the productivity while improving the overall quality of the food product
241,"And even as much as weâ€™ve reduced it already, I think thereâ€™s still further reduction to be done in the LongHorn menu to improve the -- to simplify the operation"
242,Those are very small kitchens that have to stay simple in order to cook the great steaks in a timely manner
243,Thatâ€™s fairly easy
244,"The systems having been invested in, in those restaurants, they are working on very old POS systems and so big difference in this integration than some of the others where the Cheddar's team is actually pulling from us to get this information in restaurant where some of our past integrations, thereâ€™s been a little push back because they had good systems"
245,and we are just the changing systems to change the systems
246,Here our systems are superior
247,They want the systems as soon as they can get them and they have just been -- they have been great to work with
248,We believe overall the benefits package is going to be much stronger for those team members
249,We think thereâ€™s a huge upside in Cheddar's in increasing their retention
250,"Right now, their employee retentions are above the average of the industry and we believe that if we can take them from 120% team member turnover down to our norm of 70% it's going to have a huge impact on the overall operation"
251,"So, we believe and all indications are that they like the systems that weâ€™re bringing"
252,Ian has done a great job working with his teams and talking about the systems that we are implementing and getting feedback
253,"So, I think this is going to really enhance their performance overtime"
254,"Yes, it's almost 30% and weâ€™ve got different tests out there and weâ€™ve got different products in different market"
255,"So, itâ€™s somewhere, itâ€™s approximately 25% to 30%"
256,Weâ€™ve done a really good job; the management is done a really good job there of getting back on our pathway
257,Delivering that brand in the consumer differently than how Olive Garden delivers their brand to the consumer
258,And it has a lot to do with the promotional cadence and new product introductions
259,Yes
260,We were definitely seeing an increase in frequency in LongHorn
261,We measured that every quarter with our tokens
262,"Yes, Jason, the holiday impact is minimal versus last year"
263,"The holiday shift moving Christmas basically from a Sunday to a Monday, itâ€™s really not going to be much different than it was last year"
264,Yes
265,And last year's holiday shift was about 20 basis points unfavorable
266,"So, it shouldnâ€™t be much different than this year"
267,So pretty much flat this year
268,"The industry is fighting for consumers, their consumers discretionary dollars"
269,"And Iâ€™ve said on this call before, weâ€™re not just fighting amongst ourselves, weâ€™re fighting for those dollars that have been spent in other places"
270,"I do think that overall, the industry is being a little more rationale"
271,I think there has been some okay innovation
272,and I think weâ€™re attracting consumers again
273,I donâ€
274,™t think there is a macro trend out there that says that weâ€™re pushing people
275,and I think the industry is doing a better job
276,Good observation on the high-end category because our high-end brands with the hurricanes travel really came to a halt and they were disproportionately impacted and they had -- they really came back strong
277,both Cap Grille and Eddie V's
278,I would also say that Texas has not stopped being a drag
279,"That business was for 18 months, we had pretty good presence in our high-end restaurants in Texas and that had really been a constant drag and thatâ€™s kind of flipped for us now"
280,"And the Texas restaurants are doing better and not dragging so, on a high end the consumer, it feels really good out there, the consumers out there people are celebrating"
281,", I think our brands are very well positioned, Sean Martin is doing an incredible job leading Eddie Vs, and really maximizing those restaurants and put up a great number, very, very excited about that"
282,"And weâ€™re opening a few restaurants in Eddie Vs, which is really good growth for us"
283,"Yeah, we expect to analyze the bill when itâ€™s signed"
284,Weâ€™
285,"re beginning to analyze it now, but we expect to have the impact of tax reform in early January ahead of ICR"
286,Yeah
287,"Andy, we are as you said bumping up close to our high end of our long-term framework"
288,"And it's just that, as weâ€™ve said there are years that we could be above it, years where we can be below it"
289,"Right now, we have given you our share count for the year, which is 126 million shares"
290,"So, you could probably see that we donâ€™t anticipate buying a whole a lot right now"
291,But we did last year go over our $200 million
292,"So, as we think about our return of capital, weâ€™ll see what other uses we have for that capital and whether weâ€™re going to go ahead and buyback shares"
293,"But right now, weâ€™ve given you I guess the best indication of what our share count will be for the end of the year"
294,"Well, actually for the average for the year"
295,"Couple of things, one is weâ€™re ramping on a really strong last half of last year as you think about growth and inflation as we said for the year is going to be 2%, around 2"
296,and it's just slightly higher than where we had anticipated
297,It's still around 2 but slightly higher on to be around 2 range and before
298,"But we still have youâ€™ve done the math, somewhere in the double-digit growth rates in the back half of the year"
299,"So, we donâ€™t -- while we consider that a deceleration, it's still above our long-term framework growth rate if you think about earnings after tax and our long-term framework"
300,we say 7 to 10% and that would still be above that
301,"Yeah, I think one thing about LongHorn, weâ€™re finetuning the menu as we pull it back"
302,I think itâ€™s a little bit different than the competitor that you mentioned
303,You know we had a lot of menu items that really werenâ€™t working that hard for us and weâ€™re introducing a lot of new products on a quarterly or every six weeks basis that werenâ€™t working hard
304,And youâ€™re very familiar with LongHorn Howard and a great LongHorn experience
305,is a forceful way in a hot baked potato with sour cream and real butter
306,"So, as we simplify our operation, weâ€™re executing it at a higher level"
307,"We need to get the stakes cooked correctly, we need to get the food out faster and thatâ€™s what simplification has done for us"
308,And I am really not going to comment on our competitorsâ€™ strategy
309,Well I think the answer -- thereâ€™s two parts to your answer
310,", we donâ€™t know who we are going to partner with yet and number"
311,", I donâ€™t like the current economics of the partnership"
312,"And so, I am trying to understand -- we are trying to understand their profit model"
313,and we are trying to understand our profit model doing internally
314,And once we get a pretty good understanding of both those models and they are well developed
315,I think I will have some leverage in negotiating this with a third-party or doing it ourselves
316,"So, I am not hesitant on the business"
317,I think the business is a good business
318,I am just not going to live with that current economics
319,We will do ourselves before we live with their economics
320,I understand them
321,They are not favorable enough for me
322,And I am not going to give them their discount and thereâ€™s too much profit in there because they donâ€™t have scale yet
323,"And so, we are trying to understand what that model looks like and what it looks like for us from a profitability standpoint, and we can pinpoint what their profit is and got to get to a better resolution if they want to do it for us"
324,"If not, we will do ourselves"
325,"Yes, Alex"
326,The 2% to 3% is the long-term framework we have for a couple of reasons
327,One is people
328,We have to make sure we have enough people to open these restaurants and open them strongly and doing a great job with it
329,"We think if we get too high above the 3% across Darden, it puts a strain on the people that we have in knowing the brand"
330,There are some brands that are going to be above the 3% range and some brands are going to be below the 2% range but
331,across Darden we think 2% to 3% is the right investment
332,And we do know that all of these restaurants on average are creating significant amount of value
333,"But we also have other ways to return capital and to spend our capital, whether itâ€™s in dividends or share buyback"
334,"So, we want to balance all of our capital spending including new restaurants, we think 2% to 3% is the right amount"
335,Yes
336,I think the independent growth is happening in more of the big cities
337,"And we see that, more of a real issue for our upscale brands"
338,In Yard House and Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze whether theyâ€™re located more in these upscale suburban areas or urban areas
339,Weâ€™re not seeing an influx of casual dining restaurants in suburbia that are privately owned
340,This is an urban phenomenon and not really impacting LongHorn and Olive Garden
341,Weâ€™re fairly long right now in beef
342,"So, weâ€™re covered and our teams are making good decisions along the way"
343,"Andrew, weâ€™ve had a lot of work at LongHorn and Simplification to improve labor productivity"
344,"And again, theyâ€™ve also had some deep deflation over the last few years that help margins"
345,We still think there is margin improvement for LongHorn going forward
346,"Maybe not to the level that weâ€™ve seen over the last couple of years, because eventually the beef deflation is going to become beef inflation and weâ€™re going to continue invest in quality at LongHorn"
347,And weâ€™re just not ready to talk more about individual brand margins going forward
348,"Although, if you look across Garden compared to our competitors we are the only ones drawing margins to really overtime, over last few years or actually the last six months"
349,"So, we feel good about where our margin is"
350,"We donâ€™t want to go too high on our margin, because we think value is important and that getting too far out of line with what the consumer is willing to pay"
351,"But we still have costs that we can go after, we saw our productivity gains that we can do to continue to expand our margins across Garden 10 to 40 basis points, which is whatâ€™s in our long-term framework"
352,Give us a second to find that out
353,"Itâ€™s probably in a couple of years, but itâ€™s not next fiscal year"
354,", Iâ€™m pretty sure"
355,"53-week, I think itâ€™s"
356,Weâ€™ll get back to you on that
357,Thanks
358,And I think weâ€™re ready to conclude the call
359,"I want to remind everyone that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday March 22, before the market opens with the conference call to follow"
360,Thanks everyone for participating in todayâ€™s call
361,And have a happy holiday season
