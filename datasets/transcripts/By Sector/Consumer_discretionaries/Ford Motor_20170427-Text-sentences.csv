0,"Okay, Mark, thanks"
1,"And good morning, everybody"
2,"On slide 8, that's where we'll start"
3,"And what I'll do â€“ as usual, Mark has already touched on a number of the metrics on the slide, I will also cover some of the other ones later in the presentation"
4,So I want to focus my comments here only on the things that you will only see on this particular slide
5,So let's start first with the special items pre-tax sort of in the middle of the slide
6,"You can see they came in at a favorable $24 million, $210 million better than a year ago"
7,And that is driven by the fact that we reassessed the cancellation charges associated with the cancellation of our plant in Mexico
8,We booked that in the fourth quarter
9,It was $199 million
10,"We've taken that down by $46 million, so the cancellations charges on that basis would be $153 million"
11,So that's what's driving the $24 million
12,The balance are European separation costs
13,"When you look at the year-over-year, the $210 million good news is lower separation costs associated with our European restructuring actions, as well as that $46 million improvement in the cancellation charge that's related to Mexico"
14,The second point I want to make is around our adjusted effective tax rate
15,It came in at 28.6% for the quarter
16,That was 80 basis points better than a year ago and consistent with our full-year guidance of an adjusted effective tax rate of about 30%
17,And then the last point is on the lower right of the slide in the text
18,We came in with an adjusted EPS of $0.39.
19,"Only about a month ago I suppose, I guided to $0.30 to $0.35 based on what we were looking at at that time"
20,"The $0.39, that difference is due to favorable timing of cost performance and wholesale volume largely in North America"
21,But we did see some good news in other parts of the business
22,So this is timing
23,And we don't see it having any impact on our outlook for the full year
24,Let's move on to slide 9.
25,What we're looking at here is total company absolutes and the reporting segment absolutes
26,So we have solid results for the total company
27,"Solid results for automotive at $2 billion, which made up the bulk of the company's results"
28,"Solid results in the financial services segment at $466 million and within that Ford Credit at $481 million, which we'll cover a bit later"
29,"And then, to the far right, you can see all other, a loss of $212 million"
30,"Most of that, in fact almost all of that, was net interest expense on our automotive debt"
31,"There was a very small loss at our FSM, Ford Smart Mobility LLC"
32,"And then when you go below the chart, you can see the changes on a year-over-year basis"
33,And I want to spend a little bit of time here
34,And I'll do this in selective places throughout my comments this morning
35,In the lower left you can see a decline of $1.6 billion in the quarter year-over-year
36,and this was against last year's record results
37,We have guided for the full year to a total company adjusted pre-tax profit at $9 billion
38,"Last year, we made $10.4 billion"
39,So we're expecting a decline year-over-year of roughly $1.4 billion
40,"Effectively, that decline has happened this quarter"
41,"Now when we look at the next three quarters, they will be up and down"
42,"But if we look at the aggregate of the second, third and fourth quarters, and compare that to the same period in 2016, we expect those results to be essentially flat to a little bit better"
43,"So effectively, this is the quarter in which the full year decline flows through to our full year results"
44,"When we think about what's going to happen in terms of our absolutes, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest absolute"
45,"And that's going to be driven by normal seasonal factors, the plant shutdowns in the U.S"
46,"and Europe, but also the launch of the Expedition and the Navigator"
47,"So with that let's move on to the next slide, slide 10."
48,This is the Automotive segment absolute results
49,So a $2 billion total profit
50,"You can see North America, Europe and Asia Pacific profitable with losses in South America and Middle East and Africa"
51,"And when you go below the chart, you can see that all of the operations were down on a year-over-year basis with the exception of South America with an improvement"
52,Go to the following slide
53,And here we're looking at the key metrics for the Automotive segment
54,They're all down across the board with the exception of revenue
55,You can see revenue is up a bit and that is driven by favorable mix
56,These metrics were in the context of a global industry that was about flat on a year-over-year basis
57,"As you look at our market share, our market share was down three-tenths of a point that was driven by China and by the U.S"
58,", and we'll get into the details on that when we get to the appropriate regional slides"
59,Let's go to the following slide
60,So this is what drove the change in profitability for the Automotive segment
61,"So $1.6 billion for the company, $1.5 billion in Automotive, so this is where almost all the decline for the company occurred"
62,"And as you look at it, you can see there are three major drivers; one, unfavorable costs"
63,"So if you look at contribution cost, structural cost, that's a $1.2 billion, so"
64,"a $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion was cost increase, and we'll talk about that in detail"
65,"Secondly, is lower volume"
66,"So if you look at the volume and mix and look at the callout box above that, you can see we had $400 million of good news on mix, so that positive story continues in the quarter"
67,"So we had about $0.5 billion of unfavorable performance related to volume, that was the second factor"
68,"And the third was around exchange, and that was driven by the sterling, that's the Brexit effect that's coming true, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real"
69,"So in terms of cost, the cost performance was basically around higher warranty expense"
70,"So we had guided to during the quarter about a $300 million increase related to recall, so that's one effect"
71,"We also had increased reserves for coverages, engineering expense, so that is not actually emerging opportunities, that is increases related to as, Mark was talking about relocation of capital to our fortified pillars, so this is around those utilities, the five new utilities we've guided to between now"
72,and the end of the year
73,"So you're seeing the engineering come true for that, as well as on trucks and advancing commercial vehicles"
74,Product cost that's basically the effect of the launches that we had last year
75,"post first quarter, and Super Duty is the biggest one which took place in the second half"
76,So on a year-over-year business we are seeing that cost because it actually wasn't in the first quarter a year ago
77,"And finally, commodities, we'll talk about that in the next slide"
78,"So when we look at the full year for cost, we're up a $1.2 billion in the quarter"
79,So how should we think about that?
80,"If you look at the lower left or rather the left side of the slide, this is what we're expecting for the full year, it's just a bit more than a $1.2 billion"
81,"So, again, just as I talked about on process, for cost, our view is that basically the cost increase that we're seeing in the quarter is a cost increase that flows through to the full year"
82,"When you look at the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarters individually, there will be some ups and downs"
83,"But again, if I look at the aggregate of those quarters, cost should be effectively flat or maybe up a little bit"
84,Now this is the same slide that we showed at Deutsche Bank when we gave our initial guidance for the year
85,The pattern of ups and downs is exactly the same as what we talked about at Deutsche Bank
86,"If you go to the far right of the slide, those are the increases related to emerging opportunities, those are the investments and costs in electrification, autonomy, mobility, connectivity, data and analytics"
87,That is going to represent about two-thirds of the full year cost increase
88,"So if you take that bar, move it all the way to the left, that's about two-thirds of that"
89,"The balance is basically the net of the rest, which is around the core business"
90,"We're still expecting to see efficiencies net of economics of about nearly $3 billion, and that is net of commodity increases of over a $1 billion"
91,"So those efficiencies mostly offset the investments in the core business also price related design, which actually brings revenue with that, and also regulatory cost"
92,So this is our view for the full year
93,"So just as just as with profits, we think most of the cost increase for the full year has happened in the quarter closer to the full year"
94,"Let's move on to the first of the regions, North America"
95,Many of the things I talked about for the Automotive segment apply directly to North America
96,So these are the key metrics
97,"You can see they're lower with the exception of revenue and as with the Automotive segment, that revenue is driven by favorable mix"
98,"This was in an industry that was down about 300,000 units that was both for the region, but it was driven by the U.S"
99,"Our market share was lower for the region, it was driven again by the U.S"
100,", market share in the U.S"
101,"was down 0.4, that was more than explained by fleet"
102,Fleet was down six-tenths of point
103,"Within that, about half of that was rental, the rest was a commercial and government lease"
104,", we think that's largely timing"
105,That was offset partially by an improved retail share that was up to two-tenths of a point
106,"and that was strong performance of that series, our utilities and also Lincoln"
107,Let's move to the next slide and look at the decline in profitability
108,"For North America, $1.1 billion from the record results last year"
109,"And you can see it's exactly the same pattern of things that I talked about for the Automotive segment, and it's exactly the same reason"
110,"So I won't go into details here, but that pattern continued here"
111,"In terms of guidance for the full year, it's essentially the same thing that I said earlier"
112,We're expecting North America to be solid in terms of its actually strong portfolio results but down from last year
113,It's going to be driven due to higher cost
114,We think we'll also see some efficiencies coming through in all the other cost categories that will give us partial offset
115,We also see exchange as being unfavorable
116,"And the majority just as we talked about for the total business and automotive, the majority of North Americas full year profit decline and increase in cost has occurred in the first quarter"
117,"Okay, let's move on to South America and this is a story of improvement"
118,This is the second consecutive quarter where all the metrics have improved and this was in an industry that actually did grow
119,"You can see the SAAR was up 3%, Brazil unfortunately didn't grow but the positive sign was that in the month of March for the first time in 24 months we had a monthly improvement in the SAAR"
120,So we are seeing positive signs even if Brazil starts to show up
121,"We did generate positive revenue in the quarter and that was around volume, pricing and exchange"
122,"And our market share was up and that was on the back of the strength of the Ka, our sub-compact, as well as the Ranger"
123,"If we go to the following slides, we can see what happened in terms of causal factor"
124,It was driven by higher net pricing and volume
125,Those are the key drivers
126,"Inflation, what was behind the total cost increase and then you can see the exchange, which was driven by the real"
127,"In terms of guidance, we are seeing signs of improvement in the economic environment of South America"
128,"PMIs are looking better, consumer confidence is better, the Central Bank has been cutting its policy rates pretty aggressively and so we believe that we are close to the trough of this current economic cycle"
129,"As a result, we continue to believe that the South America will see an improvement in terms of loss this year relative to last year and that will be driven by the favorable market factors tied to the economic recovery"
130,We think most of the improvement for the full year will take place in the second half of the year
131,And that's tied to the momentum that we expect to start to occur in terms of the economic environment
132,Let's move to Europe
133,"Europe had another profitable quarter, the eighth in a row"
134,"So feel very, very good about what's happening in Europe despite the effects of Brexit"
135,We are seeing a growing industry in which we gained shares
136,So very positive overall performance across our European business
137,You can see that revenue was up
138,that was driven by volume and mix
139,This was driven by Cougar and our commercial vehicles
140,"And once again in the quarter, the Ford brand was the number one selling commercial vehicle brand in the market"
141,So feel very good about that performance
142,"When you go to the following slide and look what's behind the results, you can see that the results were profitable, they were down on a year-over-year basis and this was due to higher cost"
143,Some of that associated with the launch of the all new Fiesta
144,"Some of it related to increased manufacturing costs to support the higher volume that we're projecting for the full year, but also related to recall"
145,So Europe was one of the business units that was affected by the recalls that we announced during the first quarter
146,About $100 million affected their results for that particular factor
147,"In terms of our outlook for Europe, we continue to expect Europe to remain profitable, although at levels below 2016."
148,"The key factors driving the decline are going to be the weaker sterling, but also higher costs particularly associated with the launch of the Fiesta and the EcoSport, which is coming later this year, as well as for continued investment for future growth"
149,"We do expect to see favorable market factors and we saw in the quarter again, and we expect the full year to see a continued improvement in Russia"
150,The majority of the full-year profit decline in 2016 is expected to occur in the first half of this year due to cost and stock effects related to the Fiesta launch and also the major recall
151,I just referenced that took place in the first quarter
152,"Okay, let's move on to Middle East and Africa"
153,"And here the story is basically one word, it's volume"
154,The volume is affecting every metric that you can see here on the page
155,"Decline in volume the industry in which we participate, that excludes primarily Iran as the major market that we don't participate in"
156,You can see that SAAR was down 12%
157,We've also seen lower market share
158,That's primarily in the Middle East where we've had some performance issues and also we had adverse market mix
159,So volume is the story in terms of the metrics
160,And Middle East and Africa
161,"and if you go to the following slide, you can see that very, very clearly here the causal factor slide, $124 million more than explained by the volume decline"
162,"You can see across the rest of the business the team has done a great job of managing pricing, keeping that flat"
163,And cost performance has been favorable and we're seeing some good news on the exchange
164,and that's related to the South African rand
165,"For the full year, we continue to expect Middle East and Africa to improve compared with 2016 and that's going to be driven by lower cost and favorable exchange with lower volume being a partial offset"
166,We do expect that the year-over-year improvement will largely be realized in the second half of the year
167,"If we move on now to Asia-Pacific, and Asia-Pacific is actually a two story, so there is a China story and there is a story in the rest of the region"
168,"China, this was a challenging quarter"
169,"You can see the industry was down 1.6 million units, which more than explain the decline in the overall region"
170,"This was the effective payback into the fourth quarter from the stronger fourth quarter performance related to customer expectation that the purchase tax incentive would be eliminated at the end of the year, as it turned out only half of it was, but clearly had an effect on the industry"
171,It had an effect on us
172,Our share is down and that was largely around the units that were most affected by that purchase tax incentive that was the escort and the focus
173,"And when you look at our JVs, you can see it affected them as well"
174,"We are under good profit of $274 million on a net basis with a margin of 13%, but that was down on a full-year basis"
175,The other part of the story is around the rest of the region
176,"The rest of the region was profitable, every market other than India was profitable"
177,And every market including India improved on a year-over-year basis
178,"If we got to the next slide and look at the factors behind the change in Asia-Pacific largely driven by what happened in China, and you can see that with the net pricing that's the negative industry pricing in China"
179,The volume effect
180,And then you can see we're able to hold cost flat and a bit of exchange that was more than explained by the weakness of the renminbi
181,For the full year we continue to expect to be profitable in Asia-Pacific and to actually improve versus 2016.
182,And that's going to be due to higher volume
183,", we believe, we'll see recovery of volume in the balance of the year"
184,We expect cost to be about flat
185,We will continue to see negative net pricing and we do expect to see adverse exchange related to the weaker renminbi
186,Let's move into Ford Credit
187,"There has been a lot of concern, lot of articles written, lot of papers written over auto financing in the broadest sense of the word, and we've actually been talking about that for a year"
188,"All I can tell you is that we feel like we're in a really good place with Ford Credit and with Ford, based on what we see today, what we know today, and how we've kind of factored that into our outlook"
189,"If you look at the metrics here, you can see on the second set of data there that the business grew, managed receivables were up 6%, pre-tax results fell only 6% to $481 million"
190,"When you look at some of the portfolio metrics, the next three sets of data, the FICO score is very, very strong at 741, that's on average"
191,"You can see delinquencies are up a bit, but still below the historical experience that we've had, but it's moving up, it's still not even at that level"
192,"And then in terms of the loss-to-receivables, it's approaching historical performance, but still at a very healthy level"
193,So the portfolio is performing as we had expected in the environment that we had expected
194,"And that's because the team continues to follow the same tried and true disciplined and consistent practices around servicing and origination that we've been following for many, many years"
195,"If you go to the following slide and you look at the decline of $33 million of profitability and look at the very middle, it's around the lease residuals"
196,And that's the supplemental depreciation that the team has taken in response to what we have seen in terms of auction values
197,"The rest of the factors on a net basis actually improved, driven by the favorable volume and mix of the business on a global basis"
198,So nothing this year that to us is a surprise or was unexpected
199,"If you go to the following slide, looking at financing trends, again everything in line with our expectations"
200,"If you look at the upper left in terms of our lease share as a percent of retail sales, you can see that both the industry and ourselves are beginning to pull back, if you compare that back to the first quarter of 2016."
201,"We continue to track below the industry, largely because of our product mix"
202,"If you look at auction values in the upper right, we actually saw a sequential improvement in auction values, that's seasonality"
203,"If you look at the 2017 first quarter versus 2016 first quarter, that's a 7% decline in auction values"
204,That's consistent with the industry
205,Our view for the full year is that it will be about 6% on average
206,So you'll see ups â€
207,"“ different factors by quarter point-to-point, but on average about 6%"
208,And everything we see says that we're on track for that
209,"On the lower left, everything looks good in terms of what we're seeing relative to reposition ratios and severity"
210,And we've already covered the LTRs in the lower right
211,"So again, everything is very much in line with our expectations"
212,"And then on the next slide, we just tried to capture everything that we've been looking at and everything we've been reading about in terms of concerns and trends around the financing industry"
213,And our view is that both Ford and Ford Credit's outlooks have incorporated these industry trends appropriate
214,And as a result Ford Credit itself is on track for the profit that we've guided to for the full year of $1.5 billion with an expectation that the results will improve in 2018 as a result of less supplemental depreciation
215,"If we go to the following slide, which is slide 29."
216,"So this is around cash flow, so solid performance on cash flow"
217,If you look at the first â€
218,“ maybe the fourth line there
219,I guess
220,"Automotive segment pre-tax profit at $2 billion, it basically flowed right through to the operating cash flow"
221,So the negative net spend was completely offset by the combination of the working capital and the timing differences
222,"If you look at the capital spending of $1.7 billion, it suggests to us that we're on track to the full year guidance of $7 billion"
223,"If you go further down the page, you can see the changes in debt, $200 million"
224,That is just us making normal debt repayments
225,"The pension contributions in the quarter of $200 million, that's in line with our full year plan of $1 billion, no change there"
226,"And in terms of the shareholder distributions, Mark mentioned that"
227,That's in line with our plan for the year of $2.7 billion
228,"And then finally for me on the balance sheet, very simply put, auto cash liquidity balance is strong"
229,"So Automotive is looking strong, Ford Credit is looking strong, well-capitalized, strong liquidity"
230,"And when we go down and look at the pensions, everything that we're seeing right now relative to asset returns, discount rates, our plan contributions would suggest that our funded status at the end of the year should improve compared with the end of last year"
231,"Well, let me â€"
232,"“ just to be clear, first of all, China made money in the quarter, and you have to remember that China has a number of different components, it's the JVs, it's Lincoln, it's the imported Ford brand, it's also charges that we hold centrally like around engineering that we're incurring today that would be compensated for in the future through royalties from the JVs"
233,So China made money
234,"Outside of China, we made money"
235,"In fact the only major market that didn't make money was India, and India improved"
236,"So, we saw improvement everywhere through the region outside of China, and we're profitable"
237,"So, it was, if you will, both sides of the equation were working for us in terms of profitability in the region"
238,"But yeah, as we talked about, China was a challenge in this market"
239,"I mentioned, we do expect and are restarting to see signs of that improvement both in terms of the overall market but around performance as well"
240,"Well, let me comment first"
241,"and then I'll turn it over to Marion, CFO at Ford Credit, if he has anything he wants to add"
242,But we are growing
243,"I mean, you saw that in the first quarter"
244,We would expect to see growth for the full year
245,It's not just here
246,but it's around the world
247,And I think you also have to remember what the role of Ford Credit is
248,"For the role of Ford Credit in Ford is to be there, good times, bad times"
249,", I mean that's why the practices that we follow around origination and servicing"
250,We've been through the good and the bad
251,"and we know how to manage the business appropriately in either condition, which is why we believe that we were ahead of recognizing some of these factors that are now being written about so much across the region"
252,But we think that we will grow over the balance of the year and we think that it will grow in a way that's very healthy and supportive of the overall business
253,"Marion, do you want to add anything?"
254,"Well, as you saw in the quarter, we had favorable mix"
255,"I do think, in North America, when we look at the balance of the year that -well, hold onto the mix improvement that we've been getting over the last number of quarters, I don't think that you'll see that for the full year, I think, in terms of an improvement"
256,"I think, we'll see probably mix about flat, if not a little bit lower, because the comps obviously get tougher as you get into, but we had Super Duty in the second half of last year and so forth"
257,"So, I think, the mix improvement in North America on a year-over-year basis will probably end in the second half of the year"
258,We do expect that we'll still see negative pricing in North America for the full year on a year-over-year basis
259,"So we actually we're a bit positive in the quarter, but we've actually factored in some negative pricing in the second half of the year"
260,"And again, that's related to some of the timing of launches that we had last year, which helped us actually on that front"
261,"So, I think, we've factored in both an end of mix improvement year-over-year, we have factored in continued negative pricing other than the first quarter"
262,And we've also factored in a lower industry
263,So we think that we've got a pretty good handle in terms of â€
264,“ I'll call it the cyclical pressures that you're talking about that are affecting the region
265,"Yeah, I would say that's a good observation"
266,", I would say that everything is coming out better than what we had expected, not just on Super Duty but"
267,F-150.
268,"The volumes are stronger, we have grown share, the pricing has been better, the mix has been stronger, we've actually seen some favorable performance on cost"
269,So I think everything right across the board on the whole Super Duty lineup has been good
270,Of course we've got â€“ diesel is coming in as well
271,So that's going to be another better and ahead of F-Series in terms of what we can do to attract consumers in the segment
272,"So I agree with you, everything is better than what we had expected when we talked about that about a year or so ago"
273,"Well, in terms of lease, I think we actually provided some data on that at the last chat event back in March"
274,We actually do almost no leasing in Europe
275,"And so from that regard, which is a different than some of the competitors that we're up against in Europe, so from that regard, there is no lease exposure relative to residuals"
276,"If you think about just the overall market in terms of residual values, I mean that would, depending upon how that plays out as Mark was talking about, I think that would be impacted, would be an industry effect that we would have to deal with as it happens"
277,"But it wouldn't be an impact that would affect leasing, because we don't do that to any significant degree in Europe"
278,"Yeah, another thing too is that it'll be interesting to see how this plays out"
279,"But if there is that kind of shift, you would think it would also start to give you a bounce on, in terms of the residual values of the petrol vehicle, because of the consumer movement into that and the demand for the petrols relative to diesels"
280,"Yeah, I finally found something good about lower share price"
281,and that's the fact that the cost of the anti dilutive share repurchase program isn't as great as what we had thought
282,(58:14)
283,"Well, the way that we structure our interactions with the supply base on commodities, it's a number of things"
284,"Steel is contract, right"
285,So I'm sure that our purchasing organization is negotiating as hard as they possibly can in terms of those contracts to make sure that we get the best price that we possibly can
286,"If you look at many of the other commodities though, we actually index"
287,"And so as a result of that, I think that's probably one of the reasons why when commodities are falling, we tend to get a much faster and quicker improvement, because it will flow through to us relatively quickly from the indexing"
288,I think the converse is true when prices start to go up
289,So I think the team actually is working though with the supply (59:33)
290,the amount of various commodities that we have on our components and then the suppliers' components that they are working on that
291,The other thing that I would mention is that we do some hedging
292,And so there is some protection for hedging
293,So in fact at this point in time about half of our full year exposure is already locked in through the combination of contracts as well as hedges
294,The other thing that's interesting about the commodities is there is actually a correlation of some commodities with some of our currencies
295,"And so what we'll see is while there might be bad news on a particular commodity, often times it's going to be offset by good news on a particular currency"
296,Australian dollars are really a good example of that
297,So you can't just look at the one factor
298,It's actually something that we look at across both exchange exposures as well as commodity exposures
299,Let me make a number of comments
300,"So as Mark mentioned, we're not uncomfortable at all with the fact that we have a lot of liquidity at this point in the cycle"
301,"But I want to remind you, John, that about $3 billion of that is related to the debt issuance that we had back in December, which was very specifically for â€“ to give us the capital that we could use at some point in the future to support both the core business and the emerging opportunities around strategic opportunities, whether it's equity into something, purchase of something"
302,"As Mark said, we're going to look at that very prudently"
303,And it has to be completely consistent with our strategic framework and our objectives
304,But that $3 billion of that is for that
305,"So think about the rest of it is around $25 billion, which is still above our minimum cash of $20 billion"
306,"So we think that that's not a bad place to be at this point in the cycle, but also depending upon our results, it gives us the ability to provide a very nice supplemental dividend, which was the other means that we'll use to provide distributions to shareholders above and beyond the regular dividend"
307,"So we'll have to see how the performance comes out in terms of the year relative to net income, but that's the other way that we would utilize that, consistent with our strategy on the supplemental dividend"
308,"My least favorite subject is calendarization, it's like trying to grab Jell-O"
309,"So the third quarter will be the weakest absolute of the year,"
310,so I can say that with some confidence
311,"I think in terms of first half, second half, probably the historical experience is more or less right, probably 55%, 60% somewhere in that range, would be about right"
312,But I have a big asterisk beside anything I say with calendarization
313,"Plus, the hybrid and the plug-in hybrid includes an ICE"
314,"So Brian, what I would say is that as we've mentioned already, we're expecting an average decline of 6% this year"
315,"We also have assumed and we haven't provided nor will we today, further declines in the forward years"
316,"So we are writing new contracts, if you will, on the assumption of those lower declines"
317,"So we believe that we've called that right that we have factored in what is going to happen over the next several years and have that reflected appropriately, and the books that â€"
318,“ what's going on the book today
319,That would not be supplemental depreciation
320,"I mean that's us just writing the contracts at the right level, look at the right return"
321,"It would mean, for example, if those were lease vehicles, that the leasing expense will be more expensive for Ford Credit"
322,"They can either pass it along, they absorb it in favorable marketing, but we think that we've called that right"
323,and that's how we've set up the business
324,"No, we don't take any hit, because you basically have written the contract with the assumption that that is the lower and have a lower value"
325,"Obviously, that means if the Ford Motor Company in terms of what it may have to do in terms of subvention and so forth could be more expensive than in the past, but let me have"
326,Marion just add or supplement if you want to
327,"And Brian, I just wanted to â€"
328,"“ just to reconfirm though that for new contracts, not only have we obviously assumed what would expect to happen this year, but we have further assumed declines post 2017 and that should add into the new business that we're writing"
329,"Well, I don't think, the industry has been rationale, let me just say that first"
330,"If you see what's happening, there has been a very, very slow, long, progressive increase in incentives, going all the way back from when the downturn ended"
331,So we are just on that track
332,We have so far seen the ATPs continue to stay ahead of that
333,So that's inclusive of that
334,So I don't â€
335,“ and I don't see any particular manufacturer on a consistent basis doing something that I would think is unhealthy for the business
336,"I think everyone is very much focused on margins, profitability"
337,"Does anybody in any particular month or quarter maybe try to address an inventory situation or gain a taxable advantage, yes, sure that happens"
338,But I have not seen that in terms of a consistent approach to the business
339,So I think overall the industry is relatively disciplined
340,Mark talked about what we are doing
341,We are going to continue to do what we are doing
342,"I am not aware of anything that would suggest that that trend of small increases, progressive increases is going to end"
343,"Well, we expect the declines to continue"
344,and it's actually â€
345,"“ we have factored in exactly what you referenced, which is the fact that we know how much is going to be coming back as we know what's been leased"
346,And so we've factored that into our thinking
347,"So we do see a continued decline, but I don't want to get into any characterization of the slope of that decline"
348,"My head just exploded from that question, but (01:17:19)"
349,Let me just explain how we think about it in my very simple way of thinking
350,"So the reality is that, first of all, people that buy used vehicles tend to be people that buy used vehicles, people that tend to buy new, tend to buy new"
351,"So there is some sort of area where maybe people will flip back and forth between the two, but they actually tend to be quite separate consumer sets"
352,"Second thing I would say is that, clearly with lower used vehicle values, it's going to have an effect on the ability to price for new"
353,It will put tension on that because of residual values and so forth
354,"So it may affect mix, you may find people that start to move down series or even down from segments, potentially while staying in new so there could be an affect there"
355,"It could affect variable marketing, because again what we talked about earlier around subvention cost"
356,So there's so many different impacts that could take place
357,"The way that we have generally and largely expressed that as our view of just lower volume, and so that's one of the key factors that is behind our view that the industry will decline this year from last year, and will decline in 2018 from 2017."
358,"Now, it may play out a little bit differently than that, but the thing that is interesting so far is that what we've seen today would suggest that that is what's taking place right now"
359,I don't know if Mark wants to add anything
360,"And Dee-Ann, if I could just add to that, just maybe to help to understanding"
361,"So what we do in terms of cost related to quality, I'll say, is we actually reserve with every single vehicle sold a certain amount for coverages"
362,"So that's the three-years, 36,000 miles, if you will"
363,"But we also reserve for every single vehicle we sell an amount that goes into a reserve for what we call field service actions, which are recalls"
364,So we reserve for that
365,So what happens though
366,"is that if we get a particularly large recall that comes through that is above and beyond what we can manage within that reserve, and then effectively it forces us to let it flow through the bottom line more or less, and then we've got to â€"
367,“ top up the reserve back to the level that's â€
368,“ we've â€
369,"“ we've developed a minimum level that we have to have, and we have to go back up to that minimum"
370,"So a lot of recalls you never hear about, because it's covered by the reserve"
371,"It's these sort of big, one-time, large ones and driven apart for the factors that Mark mentioned that force us to handle it on more of a flow right through the bottom line basis"
