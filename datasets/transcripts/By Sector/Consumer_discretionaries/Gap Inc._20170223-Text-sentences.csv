0,"Thanks, Jenn, and hi to everyone on the call, and thanks for joining us today"
1,"As we close out 2016, which is my second year as CEO, I want to spend a moment to reflect, reflect on where we've been and where we are and where we're going, both in terms of the work that we're doing but the overall industry context as well"
2,"When I took over two years ago, that's two years that has flown by, we and I knew our performance wasn't where it needed to be"
3,We knew that we were in an industry that was changing dramatically
4,"And looking back on it now, I think we probably all underestimated the magnitude and speed of the changes taking place"
5,It's been pretty stark what's been happening over the last year as we've looked at â€
6,“ some competitors have exited the market
7,"That said, we finished the year strong and Teri will take you through our results"
8,"And I'm pleased with the progress that we've made, but we are in a market that is in significant disruption"
9,"Let me share a couple of truths, at least as I think about them, that are on my mind"
10,"First, the apparel market is growing, whether you peg the number at 2% or 3% or 5%"
11,"We're in a market that has long-term structural growth, has continued to grow, and that is a good thing"
12,"Secondly, the market is, and we have clear evidence of this, continuing to move towards rewarding size and scale, whether that's vendor relationships that provide favorable pricing and innovation, whether it's us with a multi-brand portfolio doing business with our landlords to optimize our real estate footprint, or frankly whether it's our balance sheet and income statement where we see scale in investments, whether it's technology, innovation or other forms"
13,"But this is a market that is moving towards rewarding size and scale, and we believe that conveys us a significant structural advantage"
14,"The third, omni, almost a clichÃ© word at this point because it isn't like"
15,omni is in the future
16,Our customers are omni today and that is a fundamental reality
17,Many of our customers begin their journey with our brands on their phone and they finish it in our stores
18,Many of our customers begin their journey with our brands in our stores and they finish it on their phone
19,"And we've been doing work and we will continue to do work to really line up with where our customers are, not where they're going but where they are today"
20,"Again, I'm pleased with the progress, but we have more work to do"
21,"Finally, we believe fundamentally, there is a significant market share opportunity"
22,"To read the headlines today, you'll see the words dead, dying, sick"
23,We are none of those
24,We are healthy and strong and have a plan and clear direction
25,"But we can all pick our favorite company that's no longer in business and when the lights go off and the windows get boarded over, that is market share that is made available to the rest of the industry"
26,She's not stopping shopping
27,She's shopping someplace else
28,A time of disruption means that market share becomes more fluid
29,"And if we put what we believe are our structural advantages together along with much of the work that we've been doing on product and experience, we believe we have a significant opportunity to consolidate and gain market share going forward"
30,I've said it many times
31,"and I'll say it again, because it is foundational, we are a product company and we are a retailer"
32,"And if we don't get our product right, we will not win regardless of how good we are in digital or many other things"
33,"It starts with emotional product that she connects to that has the right quality, the right fit and the right value proposition"
34,"Two years ago when I got into this seat, we really approached product in two ways"
35,"One was some quick fixes, particularly addressing quality, aesthetic, the value and the fit and some longer term work that we've been doing where we've made significant progress"
36,"Where we have done the quick fixes, and they weren't actually quick because they required work, where we've got fit right, particularly in bottoms but other parts of the assortment, where we've re-established the quality that she is looking for"
37,"Where the aesthetic is on, on progress and tracking with where our brands need to be, we've gotten credit for it"
38,We've really gotten credit for it and you can see this anecdotally if you look at the reviews
39,You can see this in the performance of the underlying core categories where we've done this work and the customer has responded
40,"It's taken longer and I expected, to be honest, a bigger balance out of this work"
41,"It was akin to the work that I did when I was running Gap brand back in 2011, but we have seen and continue to see the validation that this work is paying off and that she is reengaging our brands in a way that makes us very optimistic"
42,Then there was the longer lead time work
43,And what it really is is what I call de-risking our product model
44,Time is the enemy in this business
45,And a typical industry average development cycle has for many â€
46,“ much of the industry's history been 10 months
47,We've done the work now to get many of our programs and many of our categories down in some cases to 8 to 10 weeks
48,"And, in fact, a third of our product across the company can be produced within the quarter"
49,This allows us to buy differently and this allows us to chase trend differently
50,This allows us to manage inventory differently
51,"A big unlock here was to separate our core basics which we can purchase very cost effectively and efficiently from our fashion items, which have more risk"
52,"And we now platform nearly 60% of our fabrics committing to the fabric in advance, positioning that fabric at our vendors and having access to capacity to be able to cut and sew garments immediately at the release of a PO"
53,"We've also substantially increased our testing of product whether that's crowd source testing, which we now have validation results in better commercial outcomes or testing physically in our stores oftentimes in stores that are seasonally ahead of where we are so that we can use that to inform our buys"
54,Another thing we haven't really talked to you much about is the tools to do this
55,"In Gap brand, which is leading the way, we're moving also to a demand-based buying model"
56,And this requires tools that are different than what we've historically used
57,"And historically the tools that we use to merchandise, to do inventory management, to do sourcing and costing, there were 18 separate tools that we were using to do that"
58,"And needless to say, some of them were on green screens and many of them didn't integrate"
59,"We have moved now to one platform that can be used across all inventory, pricing, assortment building and in-season management and we're well underway for the implementation of that platform in the company"
60,"That conveys, obviously, a productivity advantage which is important for our cost structure"
61,"Most importantly, we believe that it really helps us to get the right product in the right place at the right time, to improve the outcome for our customers and to improve the productivity of all of our inventory"
62,"Last on that front, and there's a lot more, but the last thing I'm going to talk about is the fact that we've been making significant investment in our logistics infrastructure"
63,"We've traditionally run as much of the industry has, with separate direct distribution for our online customer and retail distribution"
64,"We have the, I guess I'd call it the gift, maybe the luxury of having large retail distribution centers that are not fully utilized and the work that we're doing right now, number one, is an investment avoidance issue where we need to continue to add direct distribution capacity"
65,We're actually doing the work to convert the retail DCs to be able to ship both direct and retail fulfillment out of one pool of inventory and one DC
66,It allows us to avoid some form of incremental asset investment in new buildings
67,It also allows us to leverage and be very flexible with one pool of inventory
68,And we are part of the way through that
69,We have a clear plan for making that happen
70,"There was a slight setback associated when we had the Fishkill fire, but not significant and we'll make material progress on that in 2017 and plan to wrap that up in early 2018."
71,So there's a bunch of things underway
72,There's much more than I can talk about in this call
73,I'll look forward again to engaging with many of you as we spend time out meeting you personally
74,Let me shift now to talk a little bit about our brands in Q4
75,and I'll start with Old Navy
76,"As you can remember, we had a tough Q4 in 2015."
77,"And I have to give kudos to the team and, quite honestly, kudos to the brand"
78,We diagnosed the issues
79,We made changes
80,We leveraged our responsive capabilities
81,We modified appropriately places in the assortment
82,and I expected that really to take probably two quarters to fix
83,and we got traction faster than that
84,"Historically, types of misses that we had in Q4 would really have taken a year"
85,And it really took us four months before we started to see traction and the brand really getting back on track
86,"That yielded, this last year, Old Navy's fifth consecutive year of sales growth and a business that is approaching $7 billion in annual sales"
87,"And I have to repeat it because I'm proud of it, but I have to repeat it, which is a 12% comp in December and"
88,a 5% on the quarter which I believe under any metric represents a market share gaining performance
89,"This was driven by a strong commercial plan, cut-through marketing and great product acceptance"
90,There was tough traffic
91,"but we beat the traffic, beat the traffic headwinds to deliver a positive top line by driving a strong sales over traffic"
92,This was really what was happening with everything going on inside the store
93,A few callouts
94,We emerged as the leading market share competitor in women's dresses on a rolling 12-month basis
95,"And again, you've heard me say market share many times"
96,and I will continue to say it
97,Market share today is really omni-market share
98,Market share historically was square footage
99,"As we think about market share going forward, it is omni"
100,"and it is category-specific, and the entire company is moving in the direction of really being category market share focused"
101,"Women's dresses was a big win and we were able to drive very high-double-digit comps, not by guessing and buying into the category in a big way, but by feeding units into the business off of a responsive platform, really led by customer demand"
102,It's just really the inverse of the historical buying model
103,I continue to believe that Old Navy is very strong and our aim is to continue to invest in and build that business
104,It's a market share play
105,"The brand is incredibly well positioned across family, fun, value and fashion"
106,We have clarity of brand equity
107,"We have a strong marketing voice, and really most importantly, we have operating discipline, which is big on by mind"
108,You will hear Teri talk about that as well
109,The consistency and discipline is something that we have not had as consistently as we needed to across the company
110,And Old Navy really is the shining example of that in my mind
111,We continue to believe we have a winner in the brand with significant market share opportunity in front of us
112,Let me turn to Gap
113,"Progress has been slower than I expected, but I'm really pleased to see some bright spots"
114,"and I look for, under the covers, period-over-period improvement in key places in the business"
115,and I have not been disappointed in seeing it inside of Gap
116,Jeff and the team at Gap are doing heavy lifting right now to continue to transform the product and the operating model
117,"And probably the most important thing going on in Gap, again, is building on our responsive capabilities, moving to a monthly and demand-driven-based buying model"
118,"I would be remiss, however, to say that Gap, as we reported to you, is a very complicated composite of channels and geographies"
119,"And I point that out because, obviously, we have a big business in Japan â€"
120,"“ Japan has been a tough market for many to do business in, a large presence in Europe and a growing presence in China as well as the North American business across the three channels and a franchise presence"
121,"So as I look at Gap, I look under the covers to see what the leading edge indicators are, product acceptance, women's business, et cetera, and"
122,I'm pleased with what I see
123,"If I look at 2016, Gap is a brand in the relevant categories where responsive capabilities matter"
124,They have moved the majority of their business onto a responsive operating model
125,"A couple of standout examples are the women's knit's business, which for Gap is a big business and the woven's bottoms business, also a big business, leading the way"
126,"By Q4, those categories had grown to high-single-digit comps with margin expansion up to 500 basis points"
127,"And again, that is starts with on-trend quality product, but it also sits on a platform of the responsive capabilities beginning to show what they can do"
128,I'll move on to Banana Republic quickly
129,"As you've seen, I've made a change in leadership there"
130,and I've not yet put in a new brand president
131,"I've taken advantage of this moment to really roll up my sleeves, get into the business personally and understand what's going on"
132,Here's what I would observe
133,"There's a lot to like and a lot right in the business, but not enough"
134,"In categories where we lost our dominance and lost the trust of our consumer and we put our shoulder against realigning those categories, categories like pants"
135,"Our for-fit (16:47) women's pants complex, categories like suit separates"
136,Those categories we're seeing excellent traction with the consumer
137,"Suiting is an example, double-digit comps with a 400 basis point improvement in margin, but we need more faster"
138,"And that's really what I'm focused on right now, which is taking the next steps and taking them quickly to continue to turn the business around"
139,I'm not pleased with the performance
140,I'm disappointed with the performance
141,I do believe there's a lot of potential in the brand
142,"We don't break out Athleta, but I have to talk about it"
143,I am nothing but pleased with the brand's performance and the team's performance
144,"The customer continues to respond to the assortment, continues to respond to the aesthetic, continues to respond to product fabrications and the very strong marketing of The Power of She campaign"
145,We are seeing continued excellent growth and we believe the brand is positioned in the sweet spot
146,"Right at the intersection of performance and lifestyle which we, as a company, are very interested in, but Athleta is leading the way on"
147,I'm bullish on Athleta
148,and I'm bullish on the brand's growth prospects
149,Now let me pause
150,and I want to hand it over to Teri
151,I met Teri several months ago and we've gotten to know each other over that time period
152,We've been working now here together for five or six weeks
153,and I would tell you that I just couldn't be more pleased with having her partnership
154,"I'll make a few more comments on that, but I want her to talk a little bit about 2016"
155,and then the perspective moving forward
156,"Thanks, Teri"
157,Really appreciate it
158,"As I mentioned and she mentioned, we've been working now side by side for really six weeks"
159,"And one of the things that I saw in Teri as I was getting to know her, and I've seen in spades since she has joined the company is that she comes from a culture and a background where operating discipline and cost control are sort of second nature"
160,But she also comes from a culture and a background where the power of innovation and brand building are equally second nature
161,"And I said it before; I'll say it again, I'm very much looking forward to her partnership"
162,"We are both committed to ongoing cost control and we view many of the initiatives that we are taking as ors, not ands"
163,"In this environment with the competitive turmoil we're seeing with the skittish consumer that is out there, having a lean cost structure is not just a competitive advantage, it's an imperative"
164,"And I also believe that in the environment that we're operating today, with the volatility that we're seeing, we would be remiss if we were not constantly grinding away at our cost structure and looking for opportunities for efficiency"
165,"I do want to highlight the fact that underlying that, we are working very hard and are more done than not to really rewire the operating platform of the company"
166,"And what I mean by that is, historically, we had many functions that were duplicated across our brands"
167,And we have been working really over the course of the last 12-plus months to bring those together in what I call a best-in-class and best-in-cost operating platform
168,"Wherever we can work on a shared basis and work more effectively and more efficiently, we will do that on a centralized and shared basis, while, of course, skimming that platform for everything that faces the consumer and everything that needs be expressed through the brand fingerprints and the brand DNA, so the brands continue to show up as the brands that they are"
169,"It's another place where, as we're getting that work done, we see advantage, structural advantage from our multi-brand portfolio as we build this best-in-class and best-in-cost operating platform"
170,"Now, I've talked about market share a lot"
171,and I want to do a slight deeper dive on market share
172,and I want to highlight the active and performance category
173,You all know that this business continues to grow
174,"We have a very significant business in the space already, well north of $1 billion"
175,It is on its way to being a third of U.S
176,apparel spend and it remains a key driver in the overall apparel market
177,"It's a market that we're committed to certainly through Athleta, but it's also a market that we're committed to and excited about in our businesses that continue to build inside of Old Navy and Gap"
178,And one of the things that significantly differentiates this space versus much of the rest of the apparel market is technical innovation
179,You've heard me say this before
180,and I'll say it again
181,and you'll hear it again
182,", we believe that there is a significant opportunity, particularly in the intersection of performance and lifestyle"
183,"A couple examples of this, of this proactive innovation are the Sculptek fiber and the Powervita fiber that we have in products inside of Athleta, which is seeing significant success in their bottoms business"
184,"To further push innovation, technical innovation, we have created a small, focused and nimble innovation center, focused on proactively driving innovation at the fiber, yarn, fabric and chemical level rather than being a passive taker of innovation like we have been historically and much of the industry"
185,is
186,We've hired a super-interesting individual to run it
187,His name is Tetsuya O'Hara
188,He was leading innovation at Patagonia
189,and I think we can all agree that Patagonia has been an incredibly innovative company
190,He's just on board
191,We're really excited about what we expect to see out of this innovation center
192,"And again, that's a center that we have not duplicated across many places of the business, but a center in service to all of our brands"
193,So let me talk for a moment quickly about experience because it's critical
194,"And when I say experience, it's both the digital experience and the physical experience and, really importantly, it's where digital and physical come together"
195,I want to give you a couple examples of the progress that we're making and what I'm starting to see in terms of how this can potentially significantly change the way that our customer is engaged with our brands
196,"So number one, we believe that as a multi-brand portfolio, we have a structural opportunity to exploit some places for experience that we have not exploited historically"
197,"Today, we have a loyalty program that is single tender and connected to our credit card"
198,"We are in the process right now of building out a multi-tender multi-brand loyalty program that will deliver a rich, mobile-delivered experience for our customer"
199,"We believe, and we've actually seen results that support this, that a program like this can drive higher share of wallet, higher engagement, increased personalization and also really offer us very efficient, very effective direct communication with our customers"
200,It's a path towards cost efficient marketing and engagement versus broad-based advertising
201,We think it's a win-win
202,We're in the middle of it now
203,We introduced our first Old Navy native app just several weeks ago and have gotten very good engagement from our customers and we're continuing to move this forward
204,Let me give you another example
205,"We, as much of the industry have, traditionally operated with a point-of-sale system that is hardwired terminal based in our stores"
206,And we're largely complete in moving our POS off of hardware into the cloud and making it browser-based
207,"What this does is it obviously gives us efficiency in the back end in terms of IT, but the most important thing it does is it puts capabilities in the hands of our sales associates and our customers on the floor that were never there before"
208,"If you go back to Old Navy's Q4, what you see is a really exceptional sales over traffic spread"
209,"Not insignificantly, this was driven by the fact that we have deployed across many Old Navy stores the mobile POS which also has the ability to do stock checks, to do check inventory levels, to open credit cards, et cetera, and what we're seeing"
210,is
211,"when a sales associate has this, it changes fundamentally the way they interact with our customers in a very positive way"
212,"Let me wrap up, and I just want to summarize here for a moment"
213,"As I look across the landscape and I've learned over the last two years, and we've seen the industry continue to change and that change continue to accelerate, I am convinced that winners will dominate in four areas"
214,"First, product"
215,"If you don't win at product, you won't win at anything, and we're well on the way towards modernizing our product capabilities and de-risking our buying processes"
216,"That's innovation, that's quality"
217,", that's fit, that's on-trend every day"
218,"Secondly, brand"
219,Brands matter
220,"Strong, healthy, relevant brands will win the day"
221,"We have some of the best global brands in the world, and we're working to make them stronger"
222,"At the same time, we're continuing to build brand awareness around an emerging brand like Athleta"
223,"Third, unique and differentiated customer experience"
224,"This is where we're working very hard to solve the omni equation, to put capabilities in our hands that customers haven't historically had, to change the way our sales associates interact to make sure that every unit of demand in every place that it sits inside of this company, every piece of demand, every customer is matched with every unit of supply in a seamless, cost effective and frictionless way"
225,"Those three things together, we believe, yield a significant market share opportunity"
226,"And then all of that sits on a disciplined, best-in-class, best-in-cost operating platform"
227,This is a journey
228,"It's one that we're approaching with urgency, with determination"
229,I'm a realist
230,"I can see where we have made mistakes, and I can see where I can get very excited as the proof points begin to materialize"
231,"My money is on Gap, not only to survive this changing environment that we're in, but to emerge a very clear winner"
232,"Now, let me turn it back over to Jenn and open up the call to questions"
233,"I'll just give you a few thoughts, and I'll turn it over to Teri"
234,"I don't know if she's prepared to give you a lot of specific metrics right now that are down at the brand and channel level, but"
235,"I mean, obviously, we had a lot of inventory that was taken out of service"
236,The primary impact was on Gap
237,We had a big impact on our online and our outlet business as well as the specialty business
238,"And I wouldn't have wished for the fire to happen, but we did see that with that reduced inventory, we were able to see really nice progress on some of the key metrics of the business in terms of AUR, the productivity of our inventory and that kind of thing"
239,And it has very much informed our thinking about inventory going forward and the size of our buys (43:57)
240,"That all said, I do believe over the long run that continuing to gain market share is going to come both through better and more productive inventory, but also through units"
241,The other thing that we exercised with the reduction of inventory selectively was our responsive capabilities to be able to feed units back into the business where it was appropriate
242,"And again, I've said this a lot"
243,"The vision on my mind is to be able to always buy conservatively and be responsive enough in key categories to be able to feed units into the business, like Old Navy did in its dresses business in Q4, where we see we have real upside in terms of unit growth"
244,"Teri, do you want to add to that?"
245,I'm sure you see the public data
246,and you could tell that traffic continues to be tough
247,"We saw, as I've said that we saw a â€"
248,“ we have a pretty consistent downturn of about 3% a year and now it's gone deeper than that
249,Sometimes we see deeper than that
250,"The public data would say that February started out significantly deeper than that due to a number of things, not the least of which was the holiday shift"
251,"So we will have, as our backdrop, a negative traffic assumption that we're using as planning"
252,We think that is appropriate and conservative
253,"Now, that all said, it's really two things, which is how do you beat the overall traffic number?"
254,"And that is one of the reasons, one of the specific reasons that we are putting marketing back into the business"
255,And it is not â€
256,“ a lot of it is not the traditional advertising
257,A lot of it is digital marketing that has a line of sight to returns
258,We can look and see how do we spend down on an ROI basis to the appropriate level of return and know when we're at a diminishing level of return from our spend
259,"The second thing, and it was really exciting to see was â€“ and to me it demonstrates the relevance of Gap brand as an example, we had '90s"
260,Re-Issue Collection
261,"And with a very simple amount of marketing behind it, we got 2 billion impressions out of spending not very much money"
262,"And it shows you, again, when you get something right in a brand like that that has ubiquitous recognition and a lot of love, how much you can get for not spending if you go out, craft it and do it in the right way"
263,So marketing is really about being in the traffic spread
264,I wouldn't underestimate also the importance of what's happening inside the box
265,I was in stores again this morning
266,And I like to be before we do every one of these calls
267,and I am often in stores and there was a relentless focus across all of our brands to what I call monetize the footsteps that are coming across the lease line
268,"If there are fewer of them, how do you do better with them?"
269,And it's why I highlighted the deployment of the mobile POS
270,Old Navy drove a terrific SOT and part of that was by driving conversion in some of these stores
271,"In some of these stores during the holiday period, they were bringing 50% of their transactions on the floor"
272,And that results in a very different level of engagement with our customers and
273,"it's really one of the first times that I've seen, in my time with the company, when conversion, which can be just a relentlessly sticky metric, has moved in a way that is very convincing"
274,"So it's outside the store, beat the trend"
275,"Inside the store, monetize the footsteps"
276,"And the last thing is, let me go back to where I started, apparel is a growing category and the traffic is out there"
277,It is an awful lot of digital traffic at the end of the day
278,I've been saying inside the company that a headwind's only a headwind if you're facing in the wrong direction
279,"And a lot of the work that we're doing is really about aligning ourself with where the customer is, beating the traffic trend in our stores, which she still values, and then monetizing the traffic inside our stores"
280,I'll do the forensics on February when we have February in the bag
281,"I'm really not going to try to assign a coefficient to the delay of tax refunds and the weather and the holiday shift, et cetera"
282,"What I do know is that product acceptance when she's in the store, product acceptance is excellent for us"
283,and she hasn't stopped buying clothing
284,So I'm really spectacle that it's some big things typically don't happen in a matter of a couple of weeks
285,"And obviously with Old Navy in particular, we had a super strong holiday and carried that strength through into January"
286,"So again, I'll do the forensics when we can look back and put a bow around it rather than speculate right now"
287,Yep
288,I think the opportunity is going to be across a number of things
289,I'll just share some observations
290,"And I'd encourage you obviously, as you probably do, to get out to the stores"
291,I was in all of our brands this morning across the entire portfolio from Old Navy to INTERMIX
292,"And I guess where I see strength right now, we're getting traction across the entire company in bottoms"
293,And that is a really good thing
294,We're seeing that at Old Navy both in men's and women's
295,"We're seeing it inside of Gap, and they have a very strong bottoms development plan going forward"
296,"And as you know, to a certain extent, as goes bottoms, so goes the business"
297,They are a loyalty category
298,If I go to BR with their for-fits (54:04) and the resonance that we've gotten across that for-fit
299,"(54:10) bottoms complex and then Athleta, which has had a super bottoms business, partly driven by their responsive platform and then fiber innovation as well, those are opportunities for us as a company"
300,"We're always strong when we have a strong bottoms business, and I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing"
301,I'm not going to â€
302,"“ probably for this call, it's probably not right to go into a trend-by-trend assessment"
303,Some of these trends are continuing out there in women's tops
304,"Obviously, cold shoulder and off-the-shoulder continues and all the brands have embraced that"
305,But it's really the strength in the bottoms business that gives me â€
306,"“ it gives me confidence quite honestly, and the consistency that she has registered particularly about our fits across all of our brands"
307,Yep
308,I think that was two questions
309,Let me just
310,That's no problem
311,I was thinking
312,Can you state the first question again just really quickly (55:41)?
313,"Yeah, (55:44)"
314,"Yeah, the confidence really comes from starting out slow, reading whether or not we're getting the payback which we did a little bit in fall and then in holiday, and then we put more money into it"
315,You would have seen our â€“ hopefully seen our ad that we had on the Grammys
316,And it's confidence we got through relatively low cost marketing vehicles where we're seeing the ROI
317,"It sits on a foundation of the fact that we're connected to our customers and when our customers are responding to the product in the store, when they feel like it's right for the brand"
318,", it's the quality, it's the fit"
319,", it's the trend, it's the fabrication, et cetera"
320,", I've always said that that's the moment when you go out"
321,and you start to get a little bit louder inviting guests back into your home
322,And that's really what we're doing right now
323,I was not willing to do that back in 2011 until I felt like the product was up to what the brands want and what we're really doing with our customers
324,"is saying, come back in and give us a try"
325,We believe we have what you want
326,and we want them to trust us
327,And we're seeing â€
328,"“ again, it's not a go out and blow it up in terms of huge campaign, but it is building on some of the validation points that we've seen that suggest that we can get the incremental payoff by putting additional money into the business"
329,"Oh, the time on Gap"
330,"Frankly, the issue with the time on Gap, I would say, is a couple things, not the least of which was Gap had wandered much farther away from its core equities than Old Navy had"
331,"And I view brands, and Teri"
332,and I spend a lot of time talking about this because she obviously grew up in an environment where brands were paramount
333,"Brands at their core are about trust and when we have done this where we have swung the aesthetic, where we've gone away from categories she has expected, where we don't deliver the quality and the value that she has learned that we stand for, that's a trust issue at the end of the day"
334,And the deviation inside of Gap brand as we wandered away from the aesthetic and did some of these other things was much larger than what we had in Old Navy
335,"And secondly, as we said, also Old Navy's responsive capabilities were more developed than Gap's were"
336,And so it's a combination of reestablishing the equities of the brand and also building the responsive capabilities out underneath
337,Old Navy clearly is also in the value space
338,The value space is very strong and checking right now
339,"But I think if you look at those two things, it explains a little bit of the latency between the work we've done and seeing the results show up in the numbers"
340,"Yeah, I'm sorry"
341,What was the first phrase that you used at the Gap brand?
342,We missed it here
343,"Yeah, we definitely had gotten over-assorted in the women's business"
344,"So if you go back to summer of 2016 as an example in the knits business, we had way too many CCs on some of â€"
345,"“ I think we have six knits programs which she really responded to, but we found that the color depth that we had across CCs was way more than we needed"
346,So we've tightened â€
347,“ gone to these programs and season-over-season really tightened these things up
348,"And that's another case also where Gap has really gotten traction with a category we call snits, which are knits but seem like knits â€"
349,“ seem like sweaters
350,And so we've tightened up our traditional knit fabrication in order to create some space for snits
351,It's a wonderful spot to be because it also gives us AUR lift as well
352,"And frankly, she has responded to it"
353,You see it in the stores
354,They're easier to shop
355,"They've got a stronger point of view, et cetera"
356,I was in the store this morning at Aventura Mall
357,"and I haven't seen as clean a presentation of that in a long time, where the store was just clear what we stood for, the categories were well presented and it was a very easy store to shop"
358,"And then, sorry, I think you had an add-on to that question as well"
359,"Oh, yeah, ticket"
360,And we've done work now
361,We've been doing pricing work to really start with ticket integrity from a competitive standpoint and then understanding how the competitors
362,"and we play into whether it's a high low model, an everyday low price model or whatever"
363,We're just getting some of that work completed at Gap
364,and it's yielded some very interesting things
365,"Overall, we believe that we have really high quality integrity in our ticketed prices"
366,"And again, that's work benchmarked against the competition from the standpoint of value and the quality that our customers are getting for the ticket"
367,We are doing work and we have shown progress under the covers of reducing our frequency and depth and breadth of promotion
368,"If you've been inside a Gap store over the last three or four months, you would notice that we have largely eliminated our, what we call, POS events, where we go further in the store"
369,"And that's an example of continuing to, under the covers, back off of some of the discounting we've been doing"
370,We have a lot more to do
371,"I'm not going to kid you, but we've made some progress there"
372,and we have confidence
373,What we haven't done is any kind of wholesale re-pricing or anything like that
374,"Frankly, we don't think it's necessary"
375,There may be some categories where we think bringing tickets down makes sense in terms of competition
376,The work is also shown in some categories where frankly we had more authority that we've been pricing for as well
377,"I would just jump in there also and say, reiterate the comments I made"
378,I know Teri feels the same way
379,We're never done on looking for opportunities for efficiency inside the company
380,"One of the reasons I really welcome Teri's eyes, one of the many, is a fresh pair of eyes sees opportunities that we may not have seen sitting here"
381,"And so, that is very much on my mind"
382,"And I'm not previewing anything in terms of another cost restructuring or something like that, but I remain convinced that we have to continue to get to a lean cost structure as I said"
383,"And the other side of it is, Dana, and it's nice to hear from you, I view Old Navy as an opportunity to incrementally open some additional stores"
384,We have some infill opportunity there
385,We're experimenting with a small store format
386,"So, that number, as you know, is a net"
387,and it's a very different story if you look at an Old Navy or an Athleta versus Gap on the other side of the equation
