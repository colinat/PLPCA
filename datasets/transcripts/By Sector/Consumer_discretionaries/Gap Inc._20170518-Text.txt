Thanks, Jenn, and hello to everybody on the call, and thanks for joining us today
So I'm sure you're all observing what's going on in the sector right now
We are as all
And obviously, we're continuing to see downsizing, bankruptcies, commentary about store traffic being soft and consumer spending really lagging the overall consumer sentiment in the marketplace
We're going to see as we go through the dialogue today that we of course are not immune to any of these challenges that are facing the industry as a sector, but we also believe quite strongly and we feel that the results of Q1 are continuing to validate that belief that we are uniquely positioned to turn these challenges into opportunities
To pickup market share to grow and to really continue to serve our customers with the iconic brands that we have
To set to face these challenges but underlying that, apparel continues to grow
It is as you know a remarkably constant growth and that's a good thing
Additionally with everything that's happening in the sector, there was an unprecedented amount of market share coming fluidly into play and we're playing not just to survive the changes that's taking place, but to win in that environment
Our brands are iconic and they are legitimately and objectively loved by our consumers and we continue to invest behind the plan that I've been talking to you about now for many quarters to strengthen our relevance to rebuild and enhance our product capabilities and to deliver an exceptional customer experience to both our stores and our digital assets
Return to the quarter in a moment and Teri will share more on our financials and the specifics around guidance
But again, we're very pleased that our results in this quarter demonstrate the progress that we're making, the progress against the plan that we have been consistently executing against now for really since the time and somewhat before I stepped into this role
We know we have important foundational work to continue to do, but the strong results in Old Navy and the strength that we're seeing in athletic confirm our confidence in our strategy and we're taking the right actions to be well-positioned to differentiate starting with product and our brands and our experiences and profitably and continuously capture market share
Our priorities remained the same, product, foundationally sits on product that our customers love and we're well on the way and well into the journey of enhancing and evolving our product capabilities
Customer experience remained tantamount, brand health talent and importantly leveraging scale and operating discipline
They were our priorities when we spoke several quarters ago, they are priorities today
They will remain at the priorities as the entire organization is executing against
Just for a moment on products
We have continued to do work to solidify the fit to enhance the quality to improve the value relationship of our products and to use responsive capabilities to ensure that our products are on trend and that we can deliver units into the market share opportunities that we see
In February, I went into some more details on the work that we're doing and we continue to make progress
In Q1, we tested significantly more products versus a year ago which allows us to then inform larger buys that we're making many times based upon the demand signals that we're seeing in those tests
We also use responsive capabilities in our product process and almost 60% more of our assortment and we have some categories now where they are 100% on responses and demand base buying and we're seeing the results that we expected to see associated with that
We're also leveraging fabric platforming and importantly, we are working with fewer vendors more deeply
Just a couple of weeks ago, we held our global supplier summit where we hosted our top vendors and really continued to push into relationships with those vendors and again far few of them where we work much more deeply push into relationships where we are strategically connected, where we're leveraging their capabilities, where we're working together a season-over-season to enhance our cost and to drive innovation
These partnerships have been key to enabling us to work faster to change faster and to also respond to demand
On the customer side, we see a continuing opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty, really by continuing to be focused on the customer experiences and it's an experience in our stores where we have a responsibility to deliver a compelling experience that our customers can't get any place else and it's the digital experience and it's how those two things are connect together
We are relentlessly focused on mobile as traffic continues to move to a mobile device
We launched our native mobile apps starting with Old Navy very recently to improve the customer experience and we've already seen customers rate those apps as materially better than the experience that we were delivering on a web-based app just several weeks ago
And I've talked about operating discipline and in particular about what we call our best-in-class, best-in-cost operating model
There was leverage available out of that, some of which we have gotten, some of which remains in front of us, all of which we are committed to going after
I'm pleased with the progress that we're making, but we have plenty of work to do and I cannot discount the macro environment that we're operating in
So let me spend a moment and shift to talking about the brands
I'll start with Old Navy, a record quarter
I'm proud of the business and I'm proud of the brands and I'm proud of the team
The 8% comp was up against the tough quarter last year and it compares for the rest of the year due get harder, but an 8% comp is in an 8% comp
Clearly, out in front, the rest of the sector clearly gaining market share
It's a family brand
We did well in Easter and the team did a great job gaining share in multiple categories
I'm probably most pleased by the fact to strengthen the business is very diversified this wasn't being driven while we had great successful categories like dresses where we remained number one
The success of the business was diversified across gender and across the family and that to me, signifies sustainable strength
We've also talked for a while about the fact that Old Navy has been leading the company in some of the responsive capabilities and we're using these today to target the competition and importantly to put units into the business to support growth
It's a really good lesson as you look at the sector right now and you look at us
When you're buying responsively in a tough traffic environment, you buy units type and if traffic is negative, you will often buy units negative
In any given season on a traditional pipeline, this really constrains you to yield improvement to get growth AUR, I will call that way and as we continue to develop responsive capabilities, category-by-category and brand-by-brand, it allows us to feel growth both with AUR and yield improvement and in selectively putting units in the business to chase market share and that 8% comp sits on a platform of both of those things and we're pretty confident about our ability to continue to exploit that to our benefit
Another thing to characterize is Old Navy success is their story telling, the high fashion campaign is resonating with customers, it's continuing to enhance brand health and we are seeing better traffic trends in the industry, again due to everything, but not insignificantly due to the fact that we have a compelling story to tell about the brand and are telling in a compelling way
On a side note, we also continue to see real-estate opportunity in front of us and we opened our first holistic small store format for the brand in Walnut Creek at Broadway Plaza just a few weeks ago
It's very early days and we are figuring out how to operationalize 8,000 square feet that really has a holistic expression of the brand, but we're pleased by what we're seeing so far and we really do feel like this is going to open up some interesting opportunities
And importantly, it's a store design that is supported by foundational aspects of operating discipline, fixtures, replenishment, service models, but also by leveraging technology selectively to serve the customer
Transformational work continues and we're continuing to see signs under the covers that show progress and in particular how it showing up in margins
They are driving elements of the operating model work that we're going to deploy in the rest of the company particularly as it relates to continuing to define our demand base buying strengths
I'm confident that we'll continue to strengthen Gap and it will position it well for the future, but obviously we continue to have more work to do there
On marketing which I spoken to you about during this period, we had the 90s archive reissue, which was really a small campaign supported by some product
In terms of showing the relevance of the brand that generated over 2 billion impressions for the brand and it shows you when we use the voice right, without spending a lot of money, how much consumer resonates there is out there for the message and the story that the brand can tell
Inside the brand, active remains a success story, delivering double-digit comps on the quarter and as you know we are very bullish about the active category across much of the company
We're also continuing to see successful product innovation by launching our [scope] [ph] denim across active and in denim for Gap brand and strong consumer resonates for that innovation
Let me turn then for a moment and talk about Banana
I'm pleased with where Gap is, I'm inpatient for its progress, but I'm confident about what we're going to continue to see
Moving to Banana, you would have seen that we have a new leader in Banana with Mark's Breitbard returning to the company
As you know, Mark has been a CEO in a multi-brand company over the last four years
I know Mark well and probably the most important thing right now, Mark knows the brand, Mark knows the company and Mark is hitting the ground running
So, I'm not going to promise when we're going to see the progress that will come from Mark's and the team's leadership, but I'm very confident that he got his arms around the key issues in that business and there are tremendous opportunities to make quick progress
On our marketing and our store environment, I'm particularly passionate
We've been very quiet in our voice and the team knows that I'm not happy with consistency of execution and how we are presenting in our stores much improved product and I expect to see very rapid progress there
Athleta, which we don't breakout is continuing to be an exceptional performer, one of our key growth brands
It's positioned in a growing segment
It has strength across the vectors of brand equity, product, experience and talent
And it's not just store growth, but growing categories, 60% of their bottoms platform are on responses and they could put units into the business against demand signals very, very quickly and that is part of what is fueling in our growth
They're also a [reg] [ph] price business and so the bulk of their growth is not going to come out of yield, it is going to come out of feeding units into the business and it's one of the reasons that we are so confident that it's the right place to have pushed aggressively ahead with the responsive capabilities in a significant part of the business
They continue to rollout Athleta goal and we're seeing good signals from that and we're pleased with the incremental business as we've expressed that concept exclusively in existing real estate
They are also doing something on the side which we're committed to as a company but Athleta models as well, which is a sustainability commitment
It's part of our story telling
It's part of how we do business
And importantly, it's also part of what customers are responding too and a resonant too as we tell the story to them about the brand
We see an opportunity to continue to build Athleta to continue to build brand awareness to continue to acquire customers and to continue what to run, what is inherently an omni-channel business
And speaking of omni-channel, we have continued to make progress in our backend capabilities as well
We converted one DC in Q1 to a fully omni-DC, it is on our roadmap to convert two of those DCs into the second quarter and the second half of the year and to be clear what that allows us to do was to leverage one pool of inventory and take 999 accuracy for individual direct orders or case lot fulfillment into our stores out of the same pool of inventory
Now, traffic remains an issue
We all know that you see the industry traffic numbers
As an industry in total, everybody will report conversion numbers somewhere between the mid to low 20s and the high 30s or low 40s depending upon the business
Clearly, the industry has a traffic issue, but I've inclined to turn this around just I'm inclined to say that headwinds are only headwinds if you're facing in the wrong direction
And the way we're really approaching this issue of conversion is turning on its head and saying that we have a conversion opportunity, not a traffic problem
And we're beginning to work right now
Frankly, we're accelerating work to push forward in a subset of our stores and really configure what I'm calling a high touch and frictionless experience and I have a strong philosophy that we need to run our stores to enable 100% conversion and I'll be the first to say that's not going to happen on the back of shoveling mass quantities of inventories into our stores and it starts with the fundamentals, it starts with staffing, it starts with replenishment models, it starts with respectfully displaying our product, but it also means layering in and continuing to layer in digital capabilities and allow our customer to frictionlessly purchase at our stores even if the style, color, combination isn't there on the shelf
I'm a big believer in stores, but I'm also a big believer in digital
We will continue as we always have to manage square footage to why our customers are to support them on digital, to support them in our stores and to meet them wherever they are
Last, we continue to do what I call foundational work on our digital experience and there was money to be made by improving your page load speeds by modest personalization, by enhancing your search capabilities and as much as we talk about many of those other things we're proud of the experience that we offer our digital, we have an exceptional digital business and everyday we're committed to making it better
So in summary, our focus on product and working upstream with our vendors is unrelenting
We will never take our eye of it
I've been asked when are you done and the answer is never
We will continue to work on improving fit, improving quality and showing that our product is on trend, we deliver a superior differentiated value proposition
We're focused on meeting our customers where they are on evaluating and involving the experience across our stores and online and we will always be focused on operating discipline and cost control
This discipline will help us fund the investments in marketing, fund the investments in technology and in turn will strengthen our brands and our business
We view Q1 as continued progress, but to be clear, not as a victory and I have to underline one more time the current macro environment is unpredictable
So progress, validation, same plan we've talked to you about before we're head down focus on that where confidence going to continue to yield results
And with that, let me turn it over to Teri
Yes, let me fill the time on that and again I don't want to appeal the whole business apart given the time that we have etcetera
So, let me focus a little bit on the differentiation, but what I'll say on what gives me confidence as you know that I always look at the women's first, business first and the women's first in North America
And I'm really pleased with the progress there
Again not perfect, but that's the hardest business and it often is a dull weather for the business and I'm pleased with what we're seeing there and again it's reflected in financial outcomes as Teri noted
If I think about what differentiates the Gap as a concept, I start with brand
And again we – I love the brands
I'm completely on objective about it where we do have objective data and the objective data that we measure how brand help to indicate the Gap's view as an iconic brand and a relevant brand
We have work to do because obviously the business isn't performing up to that standard, but it's not the brand is that in anyway share performed and I go down more to the category level
We've got a fit business inside that business across the family that I think is a real opportunity to continue to drive growth
We have a latent body business and women's where we feel like particularly today with some of the fabrications and silhouettes that we have in the body business, super on trend with what she is looking for
Denim is always important and especially with innovation in denim across the entire family
I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing there and we have some early orders in the water where we bought small quantities of some technical and other innovation denim that are giving us some interesting indications, introduction of scope has been positively received
And then again across our responsive capabilities, they are continuing to penetrate inside the business and where we have them upon running
We're seeing like graphics as an example where we have a super shot pipeline, it's all on demand buying right now
We're seeing very significant comps coming out of that sector and that's where we're also building approximate manufacturing capacity as well
So that we can put it on about – make it put on about be back in store and we're seeing excellent product performance there
So, again Gap's brand is relevant
It's always going to be a composite of the underlying categories and we feel like we continue to have differentiated opportunities in those categories
No, I'll just jumping on the Athleta question and again I'm not going to go into specifics here but if you just look at the things at the fine Athleta, first of all, the active space and particularly the intersection of performance in lifestyle which is where Athleta is kind of uniquely positioned
It continues to be at above average growth segment for the market
In that space, many of our competitors are largely dependent upon wholesale
The wholesale buying calendar is much longer than we now have in many parts of the business
So especially in performance lifestyle, it allows us to be active – reactive to fashion trend which matters in that segment
It is an omni business
It has been from the get go and so we are seeing strong store performance and strong online performance and many customers who have in both of those and are most loyal customers
So, it's just the space that we're pleased with and we feel like the team is executing and the last thing is to be the voice that they have – the storytelling that they are doing, all based on the power of she and a very integrated message that we have there
We're just getting fantastic engagement and seeing fantastic loyalty
So, we're continuing to be bullish about the business and about the sector
On the vendor piece, I wouldn't say – not going to call out a quantified impact next quarter and the next quarter because really is a journey starts with fewer vendors that we do business more deeply with
It will manifest itself overtime in terms of our economics we believe that's the case
It also means that we can leverage vendor capabilities
We had as an example a continuing thing that we're doing is a denim summit when we invite our most important vendors in and we're very focused on making sure that we have sort of proactive engagement with innovation whereas in the past often times we were slow
We're now starting to see innovation that's coming at the fiber yard and fabric level right at the beginning or in fact earlier than others are and that will show up in terms of product innovation
We've pretty radically consolidated our debt vendor footprint over the last couple of years
But again this is a journey I've worked a lot in my past life where people were building a strategic vendor footprint and it's a multiyear journey where you get really tightly integrated with strategic relationships and where I would say really just scratching the surface of the potential impact broadly on business
Yes, here's what I would say is given the sort of market case if you want to describe at that way and the announcement that seem to be coming out as pretty relentlessly
We feel like we got a pretty broad based opportunity
What I – so it's less about is it in denim or kids and baby or dresses or something like that
We feel we need to be prepared and it's a department store that's closing a store and a center that we do business in, that's obviously market share that's released across a whole bunch of different categories and so what reflects inside of what we're doing now is just really being very intentional about how we're competing for those customers
Some of that is really blocking and tackling which is being present in a center, making sure the customers are aware whether it's true center marketing, whether it's true putting leaflets under windshield wiper blades, really basic stuff that their customers are invited to come into our stores of course we're looking at things like honoring loyalty programs, outstanding coupon sort of the traditional mechanisms that were used, but that's really a competitor often times of center-by-center sort of situation
At the higher level from a customer acquisition from a marketing standpoint etcetera, we're also really in the midway right now of what I would describe is being sort of competitively intentional on a way that we haven't done before
As we get an announcement of a block of closures or a whole chain folds itself up, we're doing the analysis kind of real-time to say where do we think we have an opportunity by brand and how we're going to go after that
So, this is – this isn't the future, but we do feel like there is an unprecedented amount of opportunity being made fluid right now and we want more than our fair share
Yes, right, I think it's a really good question
Just to be clear, we're fully cognizant in the fact that we may have some incremental tailwind for the reasons that you mentioned and others
That said, the traffic is the same – pretty much the same across strips and malls that we're seeing right now and so we can see – and I'm very much about – not about the averages frankly, but about the averaging those businesses and getting down into the business at the category level looking for consistent patterns across similar real-estate and those kinds of things
And so I will always be pretty relentlessly objective and try to disaggregate the fact that certainly value has some tailwind right now and the active sector has some tailwind
To be clear, bit part of Athleta's business is lifestyle rather than hard proactive and that's the business that we're competing in, in Banana and Gap as well
So to say that there is probably a little bit of incremental tailwinds from some of that positioning is probably fair inside the business to see where we're winning and how we're winning is based upon capabilities that we haven't had in these businesses historically and – that in marketing again which to me is distinguishing that, and that's why we're putting our shoulder in those other businesses against storytelling component as well
That was a lot, bundled into that one sentence of all of our sales
I'll try to get some of it
Let's – let me go to your first statement, which is there are a lot of smaller companies to crap up various entry in terms of entering this business a pretty low
You've actually objectively looks fast and look at the doors that are being shattered etcetera
The reality is quantitatively the consolidation is taking place
So, it's perhaps fragmenting from the standpoint of the noise is out there, but consolidating as some of the share comes up and available and we've seen that happen in other geographies as well where the lead apparel companies in those geographies have been consolidating market share over the last several years
It is a big part of our thesis that because of our size and our scale or operating platform, a multiple brands targeted at different parts of the – different parts of the market that we have an opportunity to accelerate that share consolidation and that's not new news is what we've been executing against
As to millennials, I might turn again that on its head which is there are lot of brands out there today against the backdrop of millennials wanting to engage with brands that have a story and have authenticity that, in fact, are entirely synthetic
When we do the research and we talk to customers and non-customers what we find is that when we tell the story, people are super engaged in the depth, the history, the legacy, the sustainability story that we have, many aspects of the story that we haven't told which is why I'm very big on really getting the holistic storytelling out there in front of customers and non-customers
I've been spending a lot of time on this one because as I look at it now, I see the product work that we've done and the quality of the product that we have in our stores and I feel like our business is lagging, the product that we have in our stores and part of it is due to storytelling and as I've been meeting people, I am met consistently with the question of why aren't you guys telling the story, so, it's really high on my list right now and it doesn't mean, boom, boom, boom, a national TV campaign
We might use TV in some cases
It means really getting what is a rich, deep, authentic story in front of our customers and allowing them to engage on that
So I'm probably less concerned about that and actually will turn that less on liability than more of an asset that I think we have because of our brands and because of the relevance
Sorry, I was so enthralled with my own voice that I got into the second part
And that's just a two-part question, right, now two questions
The store base, the answer is really the same
However, that we've been telling you for a while which is we're going to be always on looking our store base, you say Teri indicated that we're bringing our net store increase down as a function of continuing to be prudent and trimming
Again, the average is hide the true story which is we feel like we have a real-estate opportunity in front with us with Old Navy
I highlighted my comments opening in 8,000 square foot format for Old Navy with the very early returns being positive and 8,000 square feet opens up a bunch of infill opportunities that we feel can be highly productive, but again early days on that
On the more mature businesses with Banana and Gap, we've trimmed some stores, we've trimmed a lot of stores under my tenure out of the Gap brand and we will continue to do that
While at the same time like we are in Times Square and others, we'll selectively open stores if we feel like there is a place where we're not serving the market appropriately
And then you get to break the outlet freed out of that as well where as a new outlet center opens that continues to be a strong business for us
We'll embrace that and we've had some pretty good success like we have is an example on Fulton Street in Brooklyn or 125th Street in Harlem where we have opened factory stores out of the outlet locations and have seen those stores performed very, very well for us
Thanks
Just don't get frustrated, Teri
We'll work something out, okay?
And on sizing Athleta, we haven't sized it, so you didn't miss it
What I would say as I see a very long runway of growth in front of us, part of it is store count, part of it is just continuing overall to be an attractive segment of the market that is growing faster than the whole
And frankly part of it is the fact that Athleta business is not insignificantly really in the core of lifestyle and ready-to-wear despite the fact that every piece of clothing in an Athleta store has some aspect of performance associated with it
So it is a differentiated innovative offer that has a very large market that it can tap into really into the whole of her closet
So, we're very bullish on the growth opportunity in front of us
Yes
I'm actually pretty pleased with our penetration to be honest and feel like we continue to have a market share opportunity there
It varies pretty widely across the brands as you might expect
Old Navy has a very significant penetration of millennial customers that are engaged in that brand
We had Old Navy has the highest penetration of cash customers, which obviously, precludes online sales
So I'm -- I'm pleased with what we are and I think we continue to see a significant opportunity in front of us
And I sort of think about our digital business, our digital store in the same way I think about our physical stores in terms of everyday there is an opportunity to improve the quality of execution whether it's page load times, whether it's navigation, whether it's personalization, which as you know we have continued to put energy and effort again and where we even modestly personalized the experience we see positive engagement from the customers and the financial metrics all moving the right direction
Data and analytics is very much on my mind right now hitting number of areas of the business, not the least of which is certainly in e-com and you may have noted that just about a year ago we brought in somebody whose significant part of the responsibilities is to really pull all the data that we have about our customers across the physical experience and the digital experience, the card program etcetera together in a way to really provide that foundation for continuing to advance personalization going forward
So, it's certainly an opportunity that we have, I believe data analytics and AI are going to continue to play an increasing role, but it's out in the future right now and right now we have a lot – we have a lot of opportunity just by executing against the basics, but certainly in our future that will continue to see incremental opportunity there
Yes
So, on -- I'm sorry, what was the first?
Sales transfer, yes, we've talked about this before Lindsay, I'd love to tell you that we've closed the store and magically that moves into a nearby location at online and etcetera in our other brands
It isn't that easy
We worked really, really hard when we closed the store to transfer those customers whether it's into the Gap store into a Gap factory store to an Old Navy in the online business, but it isn't nearly as high as I'd like to be, and it represents – continues to represent an opportunity
And we do the basic things that you would recommend, push extra hard as we're closing a store to get our customers in that store up on our card program, e-mail capture, all those kinds of things
But I generally believe that when you close the store in the short-term, you probably giving up some market share and we've been I think pretty clear about that historically
On the store guidance, we pushed – we push some openings out and then we had some additional closures in Gap and BR
There is no drama inside of that at all as opposed to the fact that I think we've demonstrated and we'll continue to demonstrate that we're pretty relentless about grinding away and tuning and tweaking the number of store locations that we have and we're going to continue to do that
It was something that that Sabrina was very passionate about and I know Teri and I continue to share exactly that same passion
And again, it's on both sides of the equation right now
We're going to get out of stores that we don't feel the brands belong in or we feel like there is an economic issue, and then, we're going to open locations where we believe we have a selective opportunity to increase market share at the same time
And so what I don't want to do is imply that somehow, there was a strategic implication to the adjustment
It's really just a matter of course of business that we made that adjustment and communicated it right now
Yes
I would say that pick any answer you want quite honestly
There is some stores -- well, some stores will close and you're looking to say okay, there is no overlap to our business because of the segment that they serve
Some stores will close and you suck the life out of a center if it's a major department store
But lot of the stores that are closing just to be clear, the closing for a reason
And it's not like they were necessarily the strong horse pulling the cart in these places
So, our view is very simple about this
That when a store closes, there is a certain number of jeans, pairs of jeans and denim and onesies et cetera, et cetera that aren't going to out the door of that store
And to the extent that we plan those categories and then our brands are positioned relevantly from the standpoint of quality and price that is market share that is now in play
And we intend to compete very intentionally across all of our brands and all of our channels to get more than our fair share
But there isn't a simple easy answer because it's such a mixed bag right now of who's shuttering a store, who is going out of business that some of it is highly relevant and some of it is pretty orthogonal to our brands and how they're positioned
