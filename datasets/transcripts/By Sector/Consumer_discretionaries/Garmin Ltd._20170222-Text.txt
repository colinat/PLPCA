And good morning, everyone
As announced earlier today, Garmin finished 2016 on a strong note
Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million
Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively increased 25% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 54.7%
Operating margin was essentially flat at 18.6%, while operating income increased 10%
These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.72 and pro forma EPS of $0.73 in the quarter
Looking briefly at our full year performance, 2016 was a remarkable year as we delivered four consecutive quarters of revenue and profit growth
Revenue increased 7% over 2015 and exceeded $3 billion for the first time since 2008. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation increased 21% on a combined basis, contributing over $2.1 billion in revenue for the year or 71% of the total and generated 84% of our operating income
Gross and operating margins improved to 55.6% and 20.7% respectively, while operating income grew 14%
This resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.70 and pro forma EPS of $2.83, both representing strong increases over the prior year
Unit deliveries increased 4% to 16.8 million, which is the second highest in our history and broadened our total units shipped to over $173 million since Garmin's inception
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight the 2016 performance and 2017 outlook for each of our five segments
Starting with Outdoor, revenue increased 33% on strong demand for outdoor wearables, contributions from DeLorme and growth in all other product categories
Segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 62% and 34% respectively while operating income grew 32% over the prior year
Looking back at 2016, our fēnix line of adventure watches continue to show strong momentum while high-end Chronos variations are opening new retail channels at watch stores and specialty retailers
Our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables
Connect IQ now features over 2,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated more than 24 million downloads since inception
To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our first ever developer conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2017. We anticipate that wearables will continue to be strong, led by the new fēnix 5 series
fēnix 5 comes in three different sizes and features our new QuickFit band replacement system, allowing users to quickly change the style of their watch
We are also expanding our handheld device portfolio with inReach satellite communication technology, and we will introduce inReach devices into new geographic markets
Looking next to Fitness, we reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology
In addition, vívofit jr
was well received by retailers and customers during the holiday shopping season
Gross and operating margins were 53% and 20% respectively
Gross margin was impacted by product mix while operating margin was relatively flat to the prior year, resulting in operating income growth of 19%
Much has been said recently about the momentum change in certain wearable categories specifically basic activity trackers
However, demand for products with more advanced features particularly those with GPS capability was very strong in the holiday quarter
One possible explanation is that customers want more than just a basic activity tracker
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend with the broadest portfolio of activity trackers, many of which include GPS capability
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Fitness segment with strength in cycling and advanced wearables offsetting anticipated softness in basic activity trackers
Looking next at the Marine segment, revenue grew 16% ahead of the overall market, pointing towards market share gains driven primarily by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters
Gross margin was steady at 55%, while operating margin improved to 16%, resulting in operating income growth of 82% over the prior year
The marine season is off to a great start, and we are ready to serve with a strong portfolio of products for every boating pursuit
For 2017, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the Marine segment
Turning next to Aviation, we reported solid revenue growth of 10%, driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades, as well as growth in our OEM categories
Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% for the year
In recent developments, Textron Airland announced that the Scorpion light attack aircraft will be equipped with Garmin avionics, expanding the addressable market for our commercial off-the-shelf equipment into military and government applications
We are excited about our expanding partnership with Textron, and we look forward to serving on the Scorpion aircraft
I also want to mention that for the 13th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked number one in avionics support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News
I want to congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Aviation segment
While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains, new platforms, and the ADS-B mandate provide opportunities for growth
Looking finally at the Auto segment, revenues were down 17% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market
However, our global market share remains very strong
Gross and operating margins were 44% and 12%, respectively
While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we do see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV, cameras, and in our OEM business
We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities
Earlier today, we announced that BMW selected Garmin as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China
This is a pivotal win for us and validates the investments we have been making in the OEM category
Looking at 2017, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market
We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment
In summary, we see many opportunities ahead in each market we serve, and we are well positioned, with a strong product lineup
With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.02 billion, flat year-over-year, as growth in Fitness, Outdoor, Aviation, and Marine is offset by anticipated declines in the Auto segment
We are projecting steady gross margin of approximately 56%, and operating margin of approximately 20%
We expect a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65. So that concludes my remarks
Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results
We saw, Joe, particularly strength in more advanced trackers, as I said in my remarks, particularly those with GPS
I think, probably, we see more the other direction where people who got started and wore basic activity tracker or something in our vivo line might wish to move up into more advanced running devices as they explore the sport
But I think vívo, its quality is daily wear, so it certainly wouldn't preclude people from moving the other direction, but we think mostly, it's an upward movement
Definitely, we'll start late in Q1, so it will be mostly a full impact in Q2.
Well, I think some would say it's conservative, others might say it's not
But, as you know, there's a lot of dynamics going on in the market right now
I think everybody is focused on fitness and what the dynamic will be there
I think it is an area where there is uncertainty because of everything that's going on
But we believe that we still have ability to grow
Outdoor, we see ongoing opportunities for fēnix, as we mentioned in our remarks, as well as expansion of the DeLorme opportunity
Marine is off to a great start, and we do think that our product line is strong
We should be able to have a strong year in Marine
And then finally, Aviation is an industry that has had ongoing challenges with the economic situation
That's not really changing, in our view, but we do see these opportunities that we've been pursuing adding to incremental growth
And then finally, in Auto, there's not much more to say there, except that the PND market decline continues, as you're well aware, and we are excited, because we are to a point now in the business where the growth in the other segments are offsetting the declines in PND
Well, we're investing in that category as well
We have had our own sets of successes, which have been published out there, some of them, and some of them have not
We don't break it out by categories in that area, but we are investing there
We have dedicated teams, both on the sales and engineering side, that are working on product customizations and engagements with customers that allow us to win deals there
Well, there's still opportunities in PND
And one thing I'd like to clarify is that the BMW opportunity is not PND
That's auto OEM
And that's a different category of products within our overall Auto segment
But PND, we do still see opportunities there, as I mentioned
Some of the specialty opportunities in RV and truck are things that we're investing in, as well as camera technology
And we're taking a pragmatic approach, as I mentioned in my remarks
We believe there's still customers that are interested in those products
And with the right amount of innovation, we can keep the category healthy
Thank you, Paul
Thank you
So, BMW, we anticipate the program will be starting in the 2020 model year, which means late 2019 for production and revenue, start of revenue ramp
It is for vehicles in the China market
So, this is local production for local vehicles
It is a hardware-based Tier 1 opportunity
So, we invested in our factory capability in order to be qualified as a Tier 1 supplier to BMW
And as such, because it's a hardware opportunity, the ASPs are definitely much higher than what typical software opportunities are, although I can't share the details of what those are
Yeah
Ben, definitely, all of the categories in Outdoor showed growth in 2016. Golf and dogs are both very nichey categories in comparison to some of the other categories and there's been a lot said in the last year or two about the situation in the golf market and declining interest and even some notable bankruptcies in golf-specific retailers
But we're generally believing that those will be flat in the coming year
Again, they're niche categories and they have cycles
So, they'll generally be trending in line with what they have been
Thank you
Well, I think, Jerry, many of our products that we offer in Outdoor and Fitness are beyond some of the notable news that's been circulating in terms of the overall activity tracker market
So, our product lines were strong, particularly those with GPS
fēnix was a good performer
And we see people wanting to step up to a more advanced smart watch kind of a product which fēnix definitely falls in that category
Yeah
I think we talked about the secular trends, particularly in Fitness, and we do anticipate that basic activity trackers are going to see a maturing cycle starting now and going forward into the future
But with that said, on the Outdoor side, we do see positive response to our fēnix 5 announcement, and we anticipate starting deliveries of those soon
And we also do see increasing interest from retailers in the outdoor wearables
So, for example, we're gaining additional shelf space in some of the key retailers particularly in the U.S
and expanding our shelf space in the U.S
It is attracting a different kind of customer
There's certainly a strong, running bias in people that buy fēnix product, but we're also seeing people that are just generally aspirational and love any kind of outdoor activity move up to the launch
We believe our channel inventories are reasonable exiting the year and into Q1. Many retailers particularly in the U.S
try to manage their inventories very carefully as they close out their year
But we believe our inventory situation is okay
Thank you
Starting first on BMW, for this program, there's not any significant upfront investments for this particular program
We had already made investments in our factories in order to be able to accommodate this kind of win, and those are already costs that we've incurred
For the solution, it's the media graphics unit, which actually is a common architecture piece across the entire BMW line, not only in China but around the world
So, consequently, this is production of that architecture for the China market, but it's scalable elsewhere
In terms of Fitness, in terms of the mix there, as I mentioned, we are seeing stronger interest in more advanced product in the wearable side, and that includes what we would call our wellness line, like vivo, as well as, obviously, Forerunners which are all GPS products
We don't split those out by category, but I would say that GPS was the stronger performer, and basic activity trackers were weaker
We don't have numbers to share right now, but we can certainly prepare those and share them in the future
Yes
So, definitely, product mix is still a factor, even though basic activity trackers were weaker
Basic activity trackers have a very low cost basis
So, their margin profile doesn't necessarily improve the overall fitness market if they're weaker
That said, also the vívo line in general, including those with GPS, they're feature rich products, and they have to sell at a competitive price
So, consequently, their margin profile is generally lower
In terms of Apple and the specific impact on our market by the Series 2, I would say that certainly, their initial results would appear like they're doing very well with Series 2. But we don't see the impact on our customers and our segment from that device
I think that it's a very competent device and it does a lot of things, but as we've said before in the past, we believe that it's attracting a slightly different customer base than what we speak to
Thank you
Well, starting with Marine, definitely, there's a component of our outlook that reflects the improving macroeconomic conditions surrounding Marine
Marine has been kind of on a slow growth trajectory since the downturn, and we continue to see that
So certainly, some of that is due to organic market growth
But, certainly, the other part is the momentum we see in our business and particularly we believe we're taking share from the major competitors
And we believe the reason for that is our strong product lineup and superior features and technologies that we have in our products
Thank you
So, as I mentioned on BMW, what we'll be supplying is a hardware component that drives the overall media system in the vehicle
So, it is a higher dollar value type of product which will definitely benefit on the revenue side
I think in terms of margin profile in OEM, we don't break it down by category, but we generally said that the margin profile from the OEM business is generally lower than that of the overall auto business
So, there would be some downward pressure as those revenues ramp up
Thanks, Elliot
