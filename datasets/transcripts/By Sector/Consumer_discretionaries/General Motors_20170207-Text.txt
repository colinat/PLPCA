Thanks, Mary
I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results for the full year, as well as provide additional insights into our 2017 outlook
Solid and as-expected Q4 results capped another record year of earnings as we exceeded the commitments we outlined for 2016. EBIT-adjusted was a record $12.5 billion, up $1.7 billion year-over-year
EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 7.5%, up 40 basis points year-over-year
Net revenue was a record $166.4 billion, up $14 billion year-over-year
Our strong results for the year were driven by record results in North America and GM Financial, sustained strong performance in China, and continued improvements in South America and Europe
And it was these strong results in 2016 and our outlook for 2017 that gave us confidence to announce the additional $5 billion in common stock repurchases
We are committed to returning all available free cash flow to shareholders with a focus on share buybacks
This is best reflected in our recent decision to maintain the current dividend per share and reallocate the released cash from a smaller share count to make additional share repurchases
Turning to the fourth quarter, we generated $43.9 billion in net revenue, $2.4 billion in EBIT-adjusted and delivered a $1.28 in earnings per share diluted adjusted
This is very much in line with our prior guidance
In North America, revenue was a record $119 billion for the year, up $12.4 billion year-over-year
EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $12 billion for the year, up $1 billion year-over-year
Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 10.1%, achieving our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the year
In fact, North America has now achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for two straight years, and we expect to once again generate a 10% plus margin in North America in 2017. In Q4, North America generated $2.6 billion of EBIT-adjusted off a record $31.3 billion of revenue, down $200 million year-over-year
Volume and price were net positives, which were offset with costs, mix and FX
We continue to view the U.S
industry as healthy and supportive of our strong earnings outlook
light vehicle industry finished the year with a 17.5 million units sold, and we continue to expect the industry to remain strong into 2017 and over the foreseeable future
We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined, retail focus go-to-market strategy, matching supply with demand, and being thoughtful about our sales to daily rental companies
This strategy is paying off through higher retail share, higher transaction prices and better residuals
Retail share for the full year was 16.8%, up 50 basis points versus 2015. We will continue to focus on retail share with additional planned reduction of daily rentals of approximately 30,000 units to 50,000 units in 2017. Moving to incentives and transaction prices; for 2016, we significantly outperformed our closest competitors on incentives as a percent of ATPs
GM incentives were up 80 basis points year-over-year, while the industry was up a 100 basis points year-over-year
Furthermore, GM's average transaction price has increased at a faster rate than the industry in 2016. Year-end day supply is well positioned at 71 days, in line with our target of 70 days
Looking ahead to Q1, we expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remained strong and we built dealer stock ahead of our upcoming crossover launches
Having said that, we will continue to manage inventories with discipline and take the necessary actions as demonstrated by our recent shift reductions to match current production with demand
Okay
Moving on to the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results with equity income of $2 billion for the full year, about equal to a year ago
While we see slower growth in China for 2017, we are confident our new launches will improve our mix and enable us to continue to deliver strong equity income
After years of depressed conditions in South America, we're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel
We have worked hard at restructuring our business and lowering our breakeven point
Our efforts continue to payoff
The team narrowed losses by nearly $250 million this year compared to 2015 in a more challenging environment
We anticipate continued improvement in South America throughout 2017. Shifting to Europe
As Mary stated earlier, we're not satisfied with these results
Despite a $300 million impact from Brexit, we reduced losses by $550 million year-over-year, and would have achieved our breakeven objective absent Brexit
However, Brexit is a reality and we need to take renewed actions to get back on the path to a sustainable business and we will
Heading into 2017, we would expect relatively flat performance versus 2016 as we work to mitigate the Brexit impact
A few comments on GM Financial and our Corp segment
GM Financial posted record revenue of $9.6 billion and record earnings before tax adjusted of $900 million, up $100 million year-over-year
Earnings assets grew 36% to about $77 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth
We anticipate continued earnings before tax growth in 2017, as we execute the full captive strategy in the United States
In the Corp segment, costs were about $400 million for Q4, which resulted in costs of about $900 million for the year
The increased costs in the quarter were primarily related to our investments in autonomous and mobility
These costs will continue to be captured in the Corp sector
We expect a similar level of total quarterly corporate sector costs throughout 2017 as we saw in Q4. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $6.9 billion for the year, up $4.7 billion year-over-year
These results include increased capital spending of $1.7 billion, as we made investments in our portfolio, in line with our previously-communicated plan
Q4 adjusted automotive free cash flow grew by $2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by timing in working capital, including rental car activity and sales allowance accruals
We anticipate this effect to partially reverse in 2017. However, we still expect to generate approximately $6 billion in automotive free cash flow this year, consistent with the guidance we provided at the Deutsche Bank Conference
Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return on capital to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation framework
We returned $4.8 billion to shareholders throughout the year, including $2.3 billion in common stock dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion authorization one quarter early
In Q4, the company also completed the first $1 billion of the next $4 billion authorization
We expect to complete the remaining $3 billion in 2017. Last month, we announced the third share repurchase authorization of $5 billion to be completed as expeditiously as possible
The underfunded status of the U.S
pension plans improved by $3.2 billion in the year to $7.2 billion, due primarily to improved return on assets and contributions of $2.1 billion
Now I want to share more details on our 2017 outlook
As we outlined last month, we expect to deliver full-year 2017 EPS diluted adjusted of $6 to $6.50. Looking at the earnings cadence for 2017, for the full company, we expect the quarterly earnings to be more evenly distributed throughout the year than in the recent past with a slightly stronger Q1 and slightly weaker Q3 due to K2 production downtime
In North America, we expect to generate another year of 10% plus margins, primarily due to strong material cost performance and pricing driven by our new crossovers, partially offset by carryover pricing and increased content in our new launches
We see a significant opportunity for growth in adjacencies in 2017, specifically GM Financial, where we expect to once again improve earnings, as we continue to grow our U.S
captive capability
As we look around the world, we see an opportunity for improvement year-over-year in South America as the macro conditions improve, especially in our key market of Brazil, and we see continued strong profit performance in China
We expect these key drivers will lead to another strong year, maintain our improved EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margin and generate higher revenues compared to 2016. The company also expects to generate about $15 billion in automotive operating cash flow and $6 billion in automotive adjusted free cash flow
Lastly, I want to say a few words regarding recent news
We are supportive of efforts by President Trump and Congress to implement tax reform that improves the competitiveness of American companies
GM continues to share job creation ideas and industry information with lawmakers to help them create proposals that will be positive for the U.S
economy and keep vehicles affordable
Within the topic of tax reform, boarder adjustment tax is an area that has drawn the most attention and speculation
As you can appreciate, at this stage there is a significant uncertainty as to what proposals will actually be enacted and we expect to have more dialogue with you over time as details emerge
At this point, we can offer high-level insight into our assessment of the industry and GM's current sourcing picture
Our analysis shows the U.S
auto industry on average derives in the mid-50% range of its content from non-U.S
sources
Ours is lower
If current proposals are enacted, we expect to be less affected than some others
We're also taking a holistic view in considering other favorable elements of tax reform
For example, we would receive a benefit from our meaningful annual U.S
exports
Importantly, we expect our cash taxes to remain low over the next few years
We believe foreign-exchange, GDP growth and how costs and benefits are allocated through the supply chain are among the major variables that will ultimately dictate the economic outcome for GM and the industry
We'll continue to work with our government on tax reform measures that support U.S
manufacturing and the U.S
So to sum it up, quarter in line with expectations, a record full year in 2016 and we will continue to meet our commitments in 2017 as we have done over the past three years
That concludes our opening comments
We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call
Question-and-Answer Session
Yes, John
Good try to get me to answer when we're going to launch the next-generation truck
That's going to happen
Yes
No doubt
What I would say, when I look at North American in total, again starting with the overall guidance, we expect another strong year of 10% plus margins in North America
The big drivers again with the puts and takes, volume and mix roughly are going to be flat
Volume will be down year-over-year, partially due to our taking action on passenger cars, and partially due to the ramp-up of the new crossovers and some of the changeover of the trucks, but mix will be favorable fundamentally offsetting that
Price will be favorable and costs will be favorable
Those two will largely or more than offset FX
Those are the biggest drivers in 2017 for North America
Yes
I would say that as we're going through this launch cadence, whether it's trucks or crossovers or the vehicles that we launched this year or some of the impact in fourth quarter in North America related to Duramax, you always have some of those
I wouldn't say that they're materially different in 20 – the cost themselves in 2017 versus 2016, the bigger impact is on the volume side
Lease penetration in 2016 in the fourth quarter was roughly 25%, 26%
That feels like the right number for us relative to overall penetration when you look at the makeup of our products whether luxury mix, truck mix and generally that would be running at an appropriate level from an industry perspective
With low interest rates, feels to me from an industry perspective that leasing is filling some of the gap on subvented financing and that's been running very low
So the biggest drivers are cash deals, and then leasing, and then standard – kind of standard payment term is very low subvented financing at this point
Well
One, I think it's too early to speculate on the potential implications of the border adjusted tax
That's one part of tax reform, there's a number of moving pieces
And what we want to do is engage constructively around how we can best work with the administration to make sure that this is good for the economy, good for manufacturing footprint
As you can imagine, very, very complicated dynamic with supply footprint, manufacturing footprint, long lead investment, so a number of moving pieces here that we want to participate in and engage in around transition timing and other aspects of this
So again, too early to speculate on what the potential implications are
When I look at the percent of import content, yes, we are better positioned than the industry on average
Well, I think you're thinking about it correctly
As we talked about the expenditures that we'll be making on autonomous vehicles will be in the corporate sector, as we look to start to provide more visibility around that, especially as we start to monetize that opportunity on a go-forward basis
And the puts and takes on that as you look at the overall results, I would expect aggregate profitability to be better in North America
I would expect profitability to better in South America, in GM Financial as well, and relatively flat in Europe, relatively flat in China
Those are the big drivers
It is a headwind in 2017, I would say, in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at a corporate level at this point in time, not a significant magnitude, but certainly factored into our outlook
Yes
The net of the two
Hi, Rod
In which sector would you like me to start, North America or China?
So, from a North American perspective, yes, we would expect aggregate profitability to improve year-over-year
As I indicated earlier, we expect volume to be a headwind and mix to fundamentally offset that, so the favorable mix associated with some of our recently launched products
Pricing will be favorable
Again related to our crossover launches, largely reduce sales allowances
And then, overall fix will be slightly favorable when you look at material on carryover versus fixed
Fixed costs are going to be relatively flat year-over-year
So, and that will offset some FX headwinds primarily related to the Mexican peso
So, those are the big drivers
In China, it's the same kind of dynamic that we've been talking about
Mix will be favorable, pricing will be – we're assuming another 5% headwind
Carryover material and mix will largely offset the pricing and cost
And cost should be slightly up in China as we get the full-year ramp of some of the recently-opened facilities, but the dynamics over the last couple of years aren't changing in China
Factored in
I mean we factored in the expectations from a used – at least ALG and others expectations for what's happened with used car pricing
So, a continued normalization of used car pricing obviously we factor into our pricing and cost of funds expectations continuously rising interest
So, that's factored in
I mean going back to the conference we were at in January, we laid out all of the downsides and headwinds that we saw in 2017 and what we're doing to mitigate that in the context of our guidance
And the fact as you mentioned, we're part of that pricing dynamic, continued investment and new technologies, the pricing environment in the U.S
and China, for example, raw material headwinds in 2017 versus 2016. FX, from a global perspective, I mean that dynamics is not getting any better, but when you look at the things that were under our control, cost, our product launch cadence, which will improve mix and pricing
We again are confident that we're going to see strong results again in 2017.
Yes
Just to try to answer those in the order that they came in, David
As we move through 2016 calendar year, our lease penetrations came down
Early, you may recall, earlier in the year first quarter, second quarter 2016, lease penetrations were up in the high 20s% and we moved them down to where we ended
As I said, mid-20% is the appropriate level and that's something that we would continue to manage
Relative to our lease residual exposure or our thinking of lease residual, I've covered this before vis-à-vis some of the competition, we've got a different mix because GM Financial has been leasing vehicles and been the captive lease provider only for the last couple of years
We have a significantly different mix, lower penetration of passenger cars, higher penetration of trucks and SUVs, and I'm not going to give you specifics on what we're assuming from used car
All I would say is, we're anticipating continued moderation and normalization of used car pricing, not inconsistent with third party type data that you could get out there over the next two to three years
I would say, in total, in the range of about 7% over the next two to three years, but I'm not going to give a year-to-year specific
And one of the fundamentals relative to how we're running the business residual modeling (45:34), we're working with GMF, our Express Drive 100% of our vehicles being remarketed by GMF is so that we can efficiently absorb and distribute in a way that is not detrimental to residuals the vehicles that are coming off lease
And that's one of the reasons we've significantly reduced our daily rental sales as well
So taking in balance, I think we've got a reasonably balanced view of what's going to happen from a residual perspective over the next number of years
I would say the following, over the last number of years the pricing environment has been moderating
If you look at overall incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price, it's been inching up on a consistent basis, which is certainly not unexpected where we are in the cycle
We continue to be very disciplined, our actual incentive spend compared to the industry has come down back, three or four years ago we were running at 110% of industry, in the 2016 calendar year, we're closer to 103% or 104%
And I think that just highlights the strength of our product lineup
I would expect to see incentive spending inch up again in 2017. We said that we expected continued pricing challenges or competitive pricing environment in the United States and China
Within that though, when you look at our launch cadence, let's remember, in 2016 we had the oldest compact and mid-crossover lineup in the industry and still performed very well, that's going to be completely refreshed, which should provide an opportunity
Trucks continue to perform very well, demand is strong, we're running all of our plants on three shifts, full-on
So, supply and demand in balance
Where we have challenges is our cars and we're aligning supply and demand on that by cutting production
So, on balance, a more challenging pricing environment, but we think we're well positioned within that given our product launch cadence
The last point that is correct
To your first question, that Q4 I would say was run rate when we have ramped up the AV Engineering and Cruise Automation at roughly plus or minus $150 million a quarter
We weren't spending very much at all until we got into the fourth quarter and I would expect to see a run rate similar to that in 2017, roughly $150 million a quarter, that will we believe be sufficient because we've already got the architecture with the Bolt to put us in a strong position from an AV standpoint and when you look at the overall corporate sector you've get that year-over-year roughly $450 million increase plus there is some incremental legal expense in 2017 versus 2016 related to the ignition switch activities, and as I think about that beyond 2017 who knows, but that should start to moderate beyond that
So, the EBIT bridge is on a consolidated basis, so we exclude China
We report China equity income, the drivers of China equity income in 2016 similar to 2015, pretty similar volumes positive, mix is positive, pricing has been a 5% headwind, material cost performance has been a positive
And then as we ramped up plants, the fixed cost has inched up; net-net, in that dynamic we've been able to maintain the equity income, but you've seen the margin compression which we've talked about before on a go-forward basis, due primarily the pricing that the margins were going to compress and we saw that play out in 2016.
I think the drivers of the industry over there are very, very consistent, higher volume, better mix, pricing is going to be a headwind kind of in the same zip code in the 5% range, material cost efficiency will be a tailwind
And then, between their cost down, efficiency up and full run rate and the plant's fixed cost will be up slightly on a year-over-year basis, but generally consistent with what's been driving the business the last couple of years
Yes
Yeah, for the fourth quarter 2016 versus 2015, inventory build because you've got to look at the change and the change was about a 100,000 units and when I look at the net impact of that, about a $100 million, volume was up, but mix was unfavorable because a lot of that stock was building up stock of passenger vehicles, which we're now addressing
So that's kind of the impact in the fourth quarter
Absolutely consistent with what we talked about back in December
We will be building inventories, we moved through kind of first half of the year
We'll be addressing the passenger car part of this with the shift reductions that we've announced
But we'll build inventory of our crossovers leading into the launch as well as trucks and then inventory will normalize in the second half, very similar to the dynamic we had when we transitioned from the GMT900 to the K2 and then we would expect to end 2017 in the same zip code as 2016, roughly 70 days' supply
Well, the electrification costs depending on, they end up in the vehicles themselves and if it's engineering costs associated with electrification, it goes to the region fundamentally based on engineering resources deployed
The reason that we're separating autonomous is because we would expect over time, as we continue to move that business along with Maven forward into a commercial piece of the business that we want to make sure that there is visibility around that on the commercial side of autonomous vehicles, because we would expect to commercialize that obviously
That would have been part of our overall engineering expense
So certainly a portion of the engineering expense, but I'm not going to break that out separately
I would expect that our pricing dynamic if you're speaking specifically in North America will be year-over-year on new will be a little bit more robust than the $200 million a quarter in 2016 based on the crossover launches
Yes
