59,"Advancing our lead in vehicle connectivity, in March we became the first mass-market automaker to offer an unlimited data plan"
60,"Since then, we have sold more than 100,000 unlimited data plans across our four U.S"
61,"GM has more than 5 million OnStar 4G LTE-connected vehicles on the road today, more than any other automaker"
62,"Now if we look at the calendar year 2017, given the used car pricing, a softer than expected industry in South America, a more challenging pricing environment in the U.S"
63,"and China, and more pressure on commodity costs, there is absolutely no question the global environment is feeling tougher"
64,"Having said that, this management team is focused on taking the actions necessary to deliver the commitments we made in January, including EPS diluted adjusted of $6.00 to $6.50, and EBIT-adjusted margins greater than or equal to 2016."
65,Our pipeline and mix of new products are strong
66,", 10 all-new or recently redesigned crossovers are expected to drive sales and market share higher this year"
67,"At the same time, we continue to adjust passenger car output to meet consumer demand"

72,And we are always seeking additional opportunities to streamline the business and identify further savings
73,"Our solid quarter follows three years of record-setting performance and a track record of taking bold and decisive actions to execute our strategic plan, put the customers at the center of everything we do, and deliver shareholder value"
74,"And, with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck"
75,"When you say that business, Rod, are you referring to passenger cars?"
76,I wasn't sure of your question
77,"First, I would say, if you look at the cars, the Cruze, the Malibu, specifically that we just launched last year, they are on very efficient architectures; architectures that we'll use for multiple generations, not only from a light-weighting efficiency from a performance perspective, but also efficiency from a cost perspective"
78,"So, that's one opportunity that we're already putting in place â€"
79,“ or we've already put in place
80,"The brand building that we're doing is very important, also looking at the material cost performance that we continue to drive, and then really looking at configuring the vehicle and making sure we have the right vehicle offering to best satisfy and create the value for the customer"
81,There's also opportunities with OnStar and the performance and what we can drive into the vehicle there
82,"So, there's several things that we're looking at and that we continue to work on as we continue to improve the profitability of cars"
83,"So, we're very focused on doing that and are making good progress"
84,Good morning
85,"First to talk about autonomous vehicle, we continue to make very strong progress with Cruise Automation"
86,"We've given the Cruise Automation team with the right resources that we've added, responsibility not only developed from a technology perspective and integrate with the core engineering elements of General Motors, but also the commercialization"
87,And so we really are running that as a startup
88,"We haven't put specific timing out there, but I think what we've said several times it will be sooner"
89,I think than most people think
90,and we're aggressively working on that
91,and you'll hear more from us as the year evolves on that
92,So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making
93,"And also, I think one of the key things, there's a lot that is said right now about autonomous vehicle development"
94,"But when we are doing our development in downtown San Francisco, also in Scottsdale, also now in Detroit, downtown San Francisco is one of the most complex environments, and the progress that we're making with zero incidents as we take many routes around that city"
95,I think gives me confidence that we're on a very good path
96,"As it relates to electrification, when I look at all the assets that we bring to electrification, and this is why Mark has challenged the team, that we are the first OEM that is profitable in electric vehicles again from a technology, from a performance, and from an affordability perspective"
97,"And I think we have a steady ramp of products that you're going to see over the next couple years in electrification, but as we continue to evolve our BEV architecture, I think that will be the step"
98,We are ahead of the curve on our cell costs
99,We started at â€“
100,just a couple years ago we were at $145.
101,We're now below our curve as we get to our goal of being under $100.
102,And so that is progressing very well
103,"The experience that we're seeing with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the great response we're getting, because that is a car that is not only an electric vehicle, but it's fun to drive and it's really a technology platform"
104,"So when I look at what we've already got into the marketplace with our leadership position in the actual cell technology and the scale that we can leverage across the globe, specifically China, which will be the first and we believe largest electric vehicle market, I think that well positions us"
105,"So I'm not going to give you specific timing on either, but autonomous sooner than you think"
106,"And on electrification, that will really as we continue to evolve the BEV architecture"
107,"From a componentry perspective, to your point, it is a bit simpler to put together"
108,"It is in one of our very efficient plants, the Lake Orion plant in Michigan"
109,"And so, when we look at the launch, it's on track, we're currently selling in eight states, California, Oregon, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Washington"
110,We'll have some remaining northeastern states that will launch in May and then later in the year available across the United States
111,"So, we're right on plan with where we expect the Bolt EV and also important that it will have some global launches as well"
112,"So, again it's in one of our most efficient plants"
113,"It's been engineered to be very efficient to build, so we're right on track"
114,and we're pleased with the progress on the vehicle
115,Absolutely
116,We constantly evaluate that
117,"and I think the steps that we took at the beginning of the year with what you see, we're doing in autonomous, are leading in that direction"
118,"So, we're looking to create the right business model, demonstrate â€"
119,“ we're in a little different position with how we come at this and just to get to the core business and some of the â€
120,“ just a different perspective that people have on this company
121,"But that's why we are being so aggressive in autonomous, so aggressive in electrification"
122,"And frankly aggressive with leveraging our 20-year lead with OnStar and having connectively in the car and unlocking the data monetization opportunities as well as just leveraging the data to provide a distinct and better value to the customers, so they buy our vehicles"
123,So we continue to evaluate that
124,We want to put a few more
125,"I'll say proof points on the board and demonstrate that we are, I believe, best positioned, especially in electrification when you look at our track record, our scale, the leverage that we have across the globe"
126,So we're going to continue to push on that
127,"And as we evaluate, we'll look at the right time to make sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, of which is having the right availability of capital"
128,"Adam, thanks for your comments, and I am 150% committed to General Motors"
129,"In my 37-year career, this is an incredibly exciting time because not only do I believe we are putting the best vehicles on the road that we have in my career here, but when I look at the opportunities that we have with autonomous, with electrification, with connectivity, I'm very passionate about it"
130,"And so I'm 150% dedicated to this company and continuing to demonstrate that General Motors can be the industry leader in transforming transportation and also being very responsive to the environment, and I think we're well positioned to do that"
131,So that's where my focus is and will be going forward
132,"So you bring up a very good point, one that we're very cognizant of, and so we look at what the landscape is"
133,We do have OnStar deployed quite successfully in China right now
134,"But we also think there are opportunities that we're exploring of how we work in that whole ecosystem because it is a very different ecosystem, not only because of some of the issues that you've raised and the different companies that really are leading in that market, but also because of where the country is and how they're adopting technology and in some cases skipping whole generations of the way developed markets use the technology in going right to an end game solution"
135,"So when I was there just last week, we spent quite a bit of time on that topic and developing the plan of how we're going to pursue that, very specific to the Chinese market, that environment, and the potential people we might work with there as we continue to evolve the OnStar platform in that country"
136,"Yes, SGM has that"
137,"The way we view data, Adam, is that the customer owns it"
138,"And so if someone signs up for this service, they give us permission to how we're going to use that data"
139,"So again, complying with all the laws and regulations in each of the countries, that's the way we use it"
140,"But through our joint venture, SGM, we do have access to that data, as we set it up with permission from the customer"
141,Thank you
142,"Right now when we talk about it, we have a cell cost per kilowatt hour that's around $145"
143,and that's for the Bolt EV
144,and we're working that â€
145,"“ what we showed a couple of years ago, we're working on a path to get that, like I said, around $100 or below $100"
146,and we're ahead of the curve on that
147,"You have to look at the whole vehicle, how it comes together, the scale, the different offerings, is it in sharing environment"
148,"So, when we drive to that profitability, I can't just say we got to get it to act"
149,"because you've got to really look at, there's many other levers that get us to be profitable in electric vehicle"
150,"Now, we're going to keep working aggressively on the cell cost and leveraging our scale"
151,"To drive you the profitability which is I think where you're asking the question, getting below $100, we'll get there"
152,and then we'll set another target
153,Thank you
154,"And then, Brian, on the technical piece of it, we last year spent a considerable time"
155,"There'd already work being done, but had my personal attention and Mark Reuss on it as well as Randy Mott from an IT"
156,"and we put the resources together much more into one integrated organization to drive, how did we quickly"
157,"Because now if you think about it, the car used to stop, it's a pain and now the car doesn't stop there because there's so many services or apps that you can use outside of the car to get the speed and the quality and the integrity to make sure we do it right from a safety and a cyber security perspective"
158,"We pulled that whole organization together, they operate under one person that we brought into the company"
159,"So, that's the way we're leveraging the engineering"
160,and then we do have a new electrical architecture coming in our vehicles that has been under development for a couple of years and will be launched shortly
161,"So, we have addressed, I'll say, the core electrical architecture, but I think more importantly, bringing the resources and having the view that the car extends outside of the pain to make sure that we have the systems integrated well and that's the way that we operate today"
162,"And so, that's how we're addressing, I'll say, the tech piece of it to support the opportunity that we have to be first and fast in really leveraging this new area"
163,"Thank you, operator"
164,I just got a couple of comments
165,I'm really proud of the team and what they've accomplished in this first quarter
166,"This again, I think, demonstrates our resolve that we are going to continue to strengthen the core business, generate the best possible return for our owners and then continue to execute with a huge sense of urgency on the transformative technologies that are really going to allow us to have a leadership position and make people's lives safer, simpler, and better as we move forward"
167,We are a very disciplined company as we approach this
168,"I think, you've seen actions from us, you'll continue to see actions that represent us because myself, the leadership team and every GM employee, we are here to win"
169,And that's what we focus on doing every day when we are at work or wherever we are
170,"So, thanks again for participating"
