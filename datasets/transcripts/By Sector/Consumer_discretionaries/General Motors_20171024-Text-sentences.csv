42,"For example, we revealed a new autonomous capable hydrogen fuel cell platform called the Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure or as we refer to here SURUS"
43,It was designed to provide commercial vehicle solutions including flexible cargo delivery and utility services
44,"But its ability to solve tough transportation challenges created by natural disasters, complex logistic environments and global conflict also make it adaptable for military use"
45,I'm also pleased with the progress our team is making on self-driving vehicle technology
46,GM and Cruise Automation recently deployed our latest generation self-driving electric test vehicle
47,We believe it will meet the redundancy and safety requirements necessary to operate without a driver
48,It is our third generation of AD technology in just 14 months
49,The GM and Cruise teams have worked together to integrate the best hardware and software with an almost completely new and fault-tolerant systems that are unique to a driverless vehicle
50,"In fact, the latest generation of self-driving electric test vehicle has about 40% unique content compared to previous generations"
51,"Another reason we are moving so fast is because we are testing in one of the most challenging urban environments anywhere, San Francisco"
52,"In this environment, we encounter almost 50 times more interactions with pedestrians and other vehicles and complex road intersections compared to driving in a suburban environment"
53,"This testing is accelerating our deployment of self-driving technology, and we believe it will put us on the path to the fastest path toward deploying self-driving cars safely and at scale"

60,We have the right team with the right technical and business expertise to solve problems along with the passion to change the world
61,"We will host an investor event later this year to share more details, so stay tuned"
62,And now I'd like to turn it over to Chuck
63,Good morning
64,"I think when you see the new truck platform come out both full-size truck and SUVs, you're going to see us having a broader portfolio that really addresses specific customer needs including from an off-road capability"
65,"Oh, absolutely"
66,We are going to be looking globally
67,"We're working extremely hard on the technology to have self-driving vehicles and looking at it from a safety perspective, a performance perspective, but we're working hard to lead in that area, and then we're already evaluating what markets make the most sense to generate the most shareholder value"
68,"Generally, when we look at the capital spend that we'd had in the engineering spend, we are able to do the work that we want to do from AD perspective, and by the way an EV perspective and a connectivity perspective"
69,"We're going to continue to evaluate that, but our current view is that that largely is all included, because we've been driving a lot of efficiencies, especially in the capital budget"
70,"When we look at being able to reuse architectures, reuse equipment, and then also the synergies and the work that's going on in product development"
71,"So, we will evaluate because we don't want to be constrained by being able to fund"
72,We know speed is important to get the first mover advantage
73,"But right now, I'd say generally it's within those bounds"
74,"Yeah, I feel that we do have a lot of the puzzle pieces"
75,We continue to look at it
76,This is a very dynamic and evolving marketplace
77,"I think the real opportunity with Strobe is we saw an opportunity, also partnering with the work that we do at the Hughes Research Labs to look at that technology, how to really improve the capability of the technology which gives you the ability to open up the areas where you can do autonomous vehicle while taking the cost significantly out and really getting to an automotive-grade LIDAR capability"
78,So we'll continue to evaluate
79,I don't have anything to share right now
80,"But again, this is fast moving and we're going to look at what makes the most sense to allow us to go with speed, with safety, and to deliver value"
81,We are too
82,"So, I don't have anything new to say"
83,"What we've talked about is it will be, first of all, will be gated by safety, so being able to take the driver out"
84,will â€
85,“ we have our metrics we defined to look at that
86,"and when we'll be ready to do that, but we think that's in quarters, not years"
87,"And as it relates to how we deploy, we very much believe we want to maintain the relationship with the customer"
88,"And so, we're exploring many options and we could partner with someone, partner with many or work on our own the Cruise application that is being used with our employees at Cruise is going quite well, in fact we have some of those people participating in their pilot that are using it for all of their transportation needs"
89,"So, it continues to â€"
90,"“ we continue to develop that, and we're keeping our options open"
91,"Certainly, that could be possible"
92,We're keeping all options open
93,It's kind of in this point where the technology is evolving and the opportunity is evolving
94,"We're having a lot of conversations, kind of everyone is talking to everyone"
95,And we're going to continue to look at what provides us the greatest value for our shareholders over the long term because we think this is a very significant business that is accretive
96,And we're going to look to get â€
97,“ it gets gated by the technology and that's why our focus is on technology
98,The fact that we have everything under one roof and we can move so quickly
99,"I mentioned that we have our third generation of vehicle â€“ AD vehicle, test vehicle on the round, we're in parallel already working on our fourth"
100,"So, that speed with technology that is evolving so quickly, both from a hardware and a software perspective, is our primary focus"
101,But then we're going to look to how do we launch and put a business model together
102,that's most advantageous for our shareholders
103,"Thanks, Rod"
104,"I was just going to add that when you look at going back to what Chuck said about South America, Barry Engle and his team have done a great job of setting that business up in a even more cyclical business"
105,"And so, looking at that and taking that leadership team and looking at all of those business together is definitely going to be a benefit, and Barry is the right guy to do it"
106,I think we've already been transparent in what we're reporting from in the Corp segment and been clear about the amount of money that we're spending on autonomous
107,"But I think when we look it, our focus, Adam, right now is to move as quick as possible to develop the technology, have a first mover advantage and be able to not only have the safest technology, but be able to deploy it at scale"
108,That's where our focus is right now
109,And there's the integration and not when you â€
110,“ depending on how you would separate it of
111,"where is IP, where is IP formed, right now, that's why our focus is keeping it all together"
112,And I really do think it's enabling us to move quickly
113,"The amount of work that goes on between Warren, Israel, Canada and San Francisco on a daily basis is stunning"
114,"And the fact that we're working on our fourth generation, that's where our focus is right now"
115,"And I think we'll have time to look at it as that develops and as the business model develops, what is the best reporting and structure from a company perspective to drive the best shareholder value"
116,"So, Super Cruise, which you're correct that we did delay because we were gated by safety"
117,There's a lot of learning that went into that system
118,"And it's the base that the core organization has that is now the Cruise Automation team is benefiting from of safety, of redundancy, of looking at the â€"
119,“ one of the technologies was critically important
120,Super Cruise is the way we monitor the driver to make sure that they're paying attention
121,"And so, all those learnings go into Cruise"
122,And then â€
123,“ but as I look at that
124,"and I look at where the schedule we put ourselves on Cruise and how the technology is developing, I continue to be very forward-leaning on that with the work that I see happening there, and all the learnings we had from Super Cruise are transferring into Cruise Automation"
125,"Well, thanks, everybody"
126,I appreciate you participating today
127,"I hope that you see we're demonstrating that we are a very disciplined organization, that we're going to take the bold actions and make the tough decisions to drive a profitable business and a very resilient core business"
128,"Also, we are committed moving with speed and we're going to continue to invest in EV, AD because we see huge opportunity in the future of personal mobility"
129,"We are intent on leading the transformation of this industry, and we have created a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion that we believe is the future for this industry"
130,We are in a leadership position and we think it is the best way to generate long-term shareholder value
131,and you will hear more as we move forward
132,"So, thank you very much"
