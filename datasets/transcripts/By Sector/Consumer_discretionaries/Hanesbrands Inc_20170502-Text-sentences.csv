1,"Given my recent decision to retire by the end of the year, let me reflect on the past few years as a way to help frame the company's future as we launch Project Booster"
2,"Over the past five years, the implementation of our Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash strategy and all its variations has significantly transformed our business"
3,"Over this time, we've added approximately $1.6 billion of revenue"
4,We've expanded our global footprint with nearly a third of our sales now coming from our international businesses
5,"We've more than doubled our operating profit, while expanding margins by over 500 basis points"
6,"We've completed $2.3 billion of acquisitions, and we've returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks"
7,The evolution of our business model has clearly driven strong results over the past five years
8,"With Project Booster, we're entering the next phase of our evolution, which is where we fully leverage our large global footprint and unlock the full revenue and cash flow potential of our business model"
9,And we believe this positions us for continued growth over the next five years
10,"In terms of the impact and cadence from Booster; the project, which began late in the first quarter, is expected to be neutral to operating profit and cash flow in 2017."
11,We incurred approximately $7 million of cost in the first quarter or about $0.02 a share primarily from head count-related actions
12,"We expect an equivalent level of expense in Q2, which is factored into our current guidance"
13,The Booster-related costs are reflected in our adjusted results
14,"So, to be clear, these costs are not part of our acquisition and integration-related charges"
15,"The savings from these actions, which are expected to fully offset the first half costs, should flow through in the third and fourth quarters"
16,"Looking forward, gross cost savings, working capital improvements as well as growth-related investments in Project Booster are expected to build over the next two years reaching on an annual basis $100 million of net cost savings and $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019."
17,I want to emphasize that the benefits from Booster are on top of our annual $30 million to $40 million of supply chain efficiency gains and on top of the remaining synergies from our prior acquisitions
18,"And as Gerald noted, when you combine the remaining synergies from our existing acquisitions, with the expected benefits from Project Booster, we are very well positioned to exit 2019 at a run rate of more than $1 billion a year in cash flow from operations"
19,Now let me walk you through some of the specifics for the quarter
20,We're off to a strong start to the year as our results were in line with our expectations and our guidance
21,"Sales increased 13% over last year, driven by roughly $210 million of acquisition contributions"
22,"With respect to organic sales, was 4% decline versus last year, was in line with our expectations and showed sequential improvement from the fourth quarter"
23,"Organic growth in Activewear, Online, Asia and the Americas was offset by expected declines in Innerwear as well as our new Other segment, which consists of our businesses that are being managed for cash"
24,Touching briefly on organic sales
25,There were a number of encouraging signs within the quarter that reinforced our confidence for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses
26,Online sales in the U.S
27,across all channels grew at a double-digit rate
28,"Our largest business, men's underwear, grew low single-digits as order patterns normalized with a large mass retailer"
29,"Our Activewear segment returned to organic growth, while our Asia business continue to grow at double-digit rates"
30,"And as we look through the second half, simply wrapping our higher growth acquisitions and last year's exit from our legacy catalog business is expected to add over 150 basis points to organic growth"
31,Looking at our segments
32,"Activewear sales increased 3% over last year, driven by low single-digit organic growth and a modest contribution from last year's acquisition of GTM"
33,Champion sales in the U.S
34,"were up double-digits, as we continued to benefit from our refreshed product offering and increased space within the mass channel"
35,This more than offset the decline in our Hanes Activewear business
36,Operating margin of 10.2% was essentially flat relative to last year
37,Switching to our International segment
38,"Sales growth was driven by the contributions from last year's acquisitions, while organic sales on a constant currency basis were essentially flat in the quarter"
39,Operating margin of 10.6% increased 170 basis points over last year driven primarily by synergies from Hanes Europe
40,Turning to our Innerwear segment
41,Sales decreased roughly 6% over last year in line with our expectations
42,Operating margin of 20.3% was essentially flat versus last year
43,"In basics, the strength in our men's underwear business was more than offset by declines in other product categories due to challenging traffic and cautious inventory management by retailers"
44,"With respect to intimates, the entire year-over-year decline was driven by a single retailer who began its planned door closings during the quarter"
45,"We felt good about our outlook for the second half as our shelf space is stabilizing, and we're seeing traction with our new Maidenform offerings, which are being rolled out across multiple channels throughout the year"
46,"Looking at our overall results, gross margin improved 230 basis points over last year to 40.2%, driven by acquisition-related mix as well as efficiency gains within our supply chain"
47,"Operating margin of 11.6% declined 50 basis points over last year, due entirely to the roughly $7 million of costs related to Project Booster"
48,"Core operating margins increased 40 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by $5 million of acquisition synergies"
49,"The tax rate was 6% in the quarter, in line with our full year guidance, while EPS of $0.29 was at the high-end of our guidance range despite the $0.02 per share impact from Booster-related expenses"
50,With respect to balance sheet and cash flow highlights
51,"Core inventory declined 8%, while cash flow from operations improved $262 million over last year"
52,"About half of the cash flow improvement was timing related, while the other half was from structural improvements to working capital"
53,We also invested approximately $300 million during the quarter to repurchase nearly 15 million shares
54,"Turning to guidance, we reiterated our full year outlook while also providing second quarter guidance"
55,So I'll point you to the press release and our FAQ document for any specifics
56,"That said, let me touch on a couple of items regarding Q2."
57,"First, with respect to sales, our guidance includes approximately $200 million from acquisition contributions, which implies an organic sales decline of roughly 2%, continuing our improving trend to return to organic sales growth in the second half"
58,"And second, our guidance includes approximately $8 million of Booster-related expense or about $0.02 a share, which will fall primarily in SG&A"
59,"So, in summary, we're off to a strong start for the year as our results were right in line with our expectations"
60,"We grew revenue 13%, we grew earnings per share 12%, we delivered strong improvements in cash flow, and we returned over $350 million to shareholders"
61,"And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gerald"
62,"Well, as we said, about $100 million of the Project Booster number will come from cost savings"
63,"Those cost savings will be both SG&A related, but mostly cost to sales related as we continue to leverage our supply chain"
64,"And then $200 million of the $300 million cash flow improvement from Project Booster will then come from working capital improvements, and that's going to come across the board"
65,It'll come through continuing to drive improving inventory turns
66,It'll come through â€“ and also as well in improving our accounts payable and accounts receivable management
67,"So, there are lot of elements to it"
68,"It's really not one thing, but a whole organizational effort"
69,Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
70,LLC Thanks
71,And could I ask about your expectations for return to organic growth in the back half of the year?
72,What are you seeing at point-of-sale to give you comfort in that trajectory?
73,"Thank you, Susan"
74,Sure
75,"I'd be glad to, Mike"
76,"So, let's take inventory first"
77,"When we began our acquisitions a few years ago, we actually saw our turns begin to decline as we begin to integrate new businesses into our organization"
78,"As we've now become better at that, and we've kind of bottomed out kind of that two turns type of a range"
79,What we now see is that we are able to continue to integrate but do so
80,and we returned our turns to a more normal level
81,"So, I would expect to see about a 10th of a turn a year in improvement in turns from that two turns base on average"
82,So that's inventory
83,Let's talk about accounts payable
84,"As we become more global and our footprint as we become larger, we have an opportunity to become more effective in the way we negotiate terms, conditions and price with our largest vendors"
85,"And so, as we do that, we're seeing our days to pay extend"
86,I think you're seeing there's a lot of people
87,", we're seeing it as well"
88,"On the accounts receivables side, what we're seeing is that as we're able to integrate our international businesses, we're able to make good progress in reducing their DSO"
89,"We have a really strong competency in our organization, and we're able to transfer that to our acquired companies and reduce DSOs"
90,"So, it's really, like all those three things playing together,"
91,it things that we know how to do that we've done in the past and that we expect to be able to continue to do in the future
92,"Yeah, I was actually hopping somebody would ask that"
93,Our margins are really good this quarter
94,"We're up 230 basis points on gross margin, 200 basis points of that came from acquisitions, about 30 basis points came from manufacturing cost savings that dropped down to the bottom line"
95,"When you really look at the operating profit margin for the quarter, we saw the base business, the core business generate 40 basis points, that's 90 basis points of improvement from cost savings and synergies, mostly and then offset by about 50 basis points of Booster expenses"
96,"So, a really strong performance in the quarter on margins"
97,"In terms of Q2, if you do the midpoint on our guidance back into that, you find that we're expecting operating margins in second quarter to be down about 150 basis points"
98,That's 100 basis points from the dilution from the short-term dilution from the lower margin acquisitions that we did last year
99,"The core margins, it should be fairly flattish except for the 50 basis points from Project Booster that will flow through in the quarter"
100,We're kind of expecting flattish margins because we're going to see a little bit of a richer mix towards Activewear this year versus last year in the quarter
101,And that business has a little bit lower margins
102,"Yeah, I think as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we would expect the Booster expenses and savings in 2017 to pretty well offset each other"
103,"Then as we roll into 2018 and 2019, you would expect similar to what we've seen with synergies"
104,We expect to see the SG&A savings come a little faster than the cost of sales because the cost of sales take a little longer to flow through to the balance sheet and then on to the P&L
105,"So, what that would suggest then is that in terms of cadence, you'll see savings in both 2018 and 2019, though skewed a little bit more to 2019 as our current plan"
106,"But you'll see savings and investments throughout that period, and we should hit a run rate net savings of about $100 million by the end of 2019."
107,"I'm sorry, I meant operating profit margin would be more flattish"
108,Core operating margin would be flattish in Q2.
109,I think you're going to continue to see improvement
110,"I don't want to start giving guidance on gross profit margin, but we'll continue to see improvement"
111,"It's the same dynamic that you saw in the first quarter that you should see in the second quarter, perhaps not necessarily on the same scale, but should see strong improvements year-over-year"
112,"Yeah, it was very strong, but we expect â€"
113,"“ what we said historically is that, we do expect â€“ even when we wrap the acquisitions in the beginning of the third quarter, we still expect to see incremental gross margin improvement quarter-after-quarter or year-over-year, improvement in each quarter"
114,"Well, I'll tell you, we don't generally give guidance on that"
115,"Historically, our cash taxes have been half or less of our estimated tax rate"
116,"That varies from year-to-year though, Carla"
117,It's not generally a big driver of cash flow one way or the other
