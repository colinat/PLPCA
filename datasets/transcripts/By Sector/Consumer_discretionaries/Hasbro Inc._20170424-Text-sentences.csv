65,"Now, I'll turn the call back to Brian"
66,"Morning, Felicia"
67,"Well, everything else was kind of relatively consistent with the prior year, with the exception of we did have higher interest income this year, as we see rates going up a bit and with our cash balance, we do have higher interest income in that line"
68,But the one thing that was different and we really don't forecast â€
69,“ it just is kind of what it is â€“ is the FX gain and it was just a little bit higher than that
70,But your math is not that far off
71,"So, we wanted to point that out"
72,"The other thing was the excess tax benefit, because the increase in our stock price, we had said at Toy Fair, we thought it would be about $0.08 in the first quarter"
73,and it was about $0.11.
74,"So, we wanted to make sure we highlighted that"
75,And that was just the benefit that our employees got from when all of the vesting took place in the beginning of the â€“ or during the first quarter
76,"No, that falls into the tax line"
77,"But, our underlying -"
78,I guess I'm still thinking about your question on our expectations versus not
79,We really tried to highlight and that was something that was different than our expectations that we laid out at Toy Fair and that is in the tax line
80,"Yeah, we would say the only unusual thing that you really can't put your finger on is the FX gain"
81,"I mean, that's still dependent on where the rates are going"
82,We hedged about 75% of our product purchases last year
83,And we're hedged a little bit less than that this year
84,"The hedges are a bit less favorable than they were in the past, as rates have kind of leveled out this year"
85,"So, overall, we'll have a bit of a negative impact that impacts gross margin, but â€"
86,“ and we'll take pricing to compensate for some of that as we go through the year
87,"We still see our numbers kind of in line with what we set out for the full year, just as a bit of â€“ because it's such a small quarter, little things can have such a big impact on our different percentages of revenue in the first quarter"
88,"But overall, for the full year, we still see our numbers in line with what we set out at Toy Fair"
89,It's really hard to say
90,"I mean, it's probably â€"
91,"“ most of our purchases come through in the third and fourth quarter, along with our sales"
92,"So, I would think that that would be it"
93,But you probably just won't see it as much because they are such big quarters
94,ArpinÃ©
95,", let me address your first question"
96,"So, the extra week comes at the beginning of our fiscal year, which is the end of the calendar year"
97,So it's essentially that week between Christmas and New Year
98,"And really, a lot of retailers don't take a lot at shipments in that timeframe"
99,Many of our offices are closed down
100,"So, from a revenue standpoint, it truly is negligible, if we have any at all, but the expenses are fixed"
101,"Typically, we have to pay salaries"
102,"We pay things like that, rents"
103,So our expenses are pretty much fixed
104,And that's why you get that extra week
105,It only happens once every several years
106,"So, we don't talk about that much"
107,"But it's a 14-week period versus a 13-week period, and that's really why we highlighted that"
108,"So, Michael, I'll just grab the stock price one, quickly"
109,We're just assuming a stock price similar to what we had around the end of our first quarter
110,So we've had some moderate box office before
111,"Our share of TRANSFORMERS, again, very modest share of box office, but that was booked in our Entertainment and Licensing segment and the box office related to this movie will be booked there as well"
