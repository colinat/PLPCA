Thank you, Jill, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning
We're pleased to report our first quarter as the new simplified Hilton with the RevPAR growth, at the top end of our guidance range, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS results above expectations and with good progress on our recently announced share repurchase program
As a result of the strong start to the year, we're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year
We continue to see tremendous momentum in unit growth as our share of global hotel development continues to increase
We opened nearly 8,000 net rooms in the quarter and we remain on track to deliver approximately 6.5% net unit growth this year, while adding over a 100,000 new signed rooms to our development pipeline
We expect 2017 to be another record year for construction starts, openings and net unit growth
Our top line performance continues to benefit from favorable fundamentals along with market share premiums driven by our industry-leading brands and commercial platform
System-wide RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter helped by the Easter calendar shift
Leisure and corporate transient both performed well and group RevPAR meaningfully outperformed our expectations
Looking forward, macroeconomic forecasts are relatively unchanged since last quarter with U.S
GDP and non-residential fixed investment expected to outpace 2016 growth rates
Modestly accelerating demand should offset forecasted supply growth, allowing us to deliver a full-year system-wide RevPAR growth in the 1% to 3% range, driven by solid group and transient performance
Group position for the year remains positive with nearly 85% of the business on the books
Turning to development, our pipeline increased 16% year-over-year to a record 2,100 hotels and 325,000 rooms
Hotel owners continue to invest in our growth at a record pace, accelerating our net unit growth
We continued to approach our growth in a strategic and discipline way with new units coming from existing brands in both new and current markets as well as organically-developed new brands targeted at incremental market segments
All brand segments are at record pipelines and the pipeline mix is similar to our installed base with balanced distribution across chain scales
As our growth is almost entirely financed by third parties, we generate substantial returns on minimal capital investment
We also generate leading returns on our owners' investments, which enables us to continue growing franchise rates
Our effective rate is currently at 4.8% system-wide and heading towards the 5.6% as contracts step up to current rates, increasing roughly 10 basis points per year
We've had great success with our new brands, which have been developed at minimal cost
We recently opened our first Tru by Hilton just 15 months after the brand launch
The property located in Oklahoma City is owned by Champion Hotels
With more than a dozen signed Trus, Champion Hotels is an incredible supporter of the Tru brand and we're thrilled to celebrate this milestone with such a great partner
We expect to open about 10 Tru hotels by year end and an additional 75 next year
There are currently 425 Trus in various stages of development, of which roughly 90% are with current Hilton owners
According to STR, Tru represents more than 30% of the U.S
industry's midscale pipeline
We also continued to get great traction on our conversion-oriented brands where deals can move quickly through our pipeline and add to unit growth in the year without increasing industry supply
Curio, our four-plus star conversion brand, continues to attract both domestic and international attention
Over the last several months, we opened our first Curio in the Middle East and signed several projects across Continental Europe
As of the end of the quarter, we had nearly 90 Curio hotels opened and in the pipeline
Our newest conversion brand, Tapestry by Hilton, sits just below Curio in the three-star category
At quarter end, we had 60 projects signed or in various stages of negotiations
Additionally, we're on track to open our first Tapestry in the second quarter, less than six months after the brand's launch
In addition to new brands, we think our existing brands have terrific upside, especially in the international markets
Last week, we opened our 100th hotel in China, up from just five hotels under a decade ago
Today, our pipeline in China totals nearly 275 hotels and 70,000 rooms driving our number one ranking in rooms under construction in the country, and 21% share of total rooms under construction in the Asia Pacific region
We celebrated a major milestone in March with the opening of the Homewood Suites, French Quarter in New Orleans, which is our 800th hotel in our all-suites brand portfolio
This segment has been a really strong performer with RevPAR Indexes over a 120, and we expect to have another 350 suite hotels open over the next two years
Marking another significant milestone, today we actually opened the Hilton Rio de Janeiro Copacabana which is our 100th hotel in Latin America
This brings our supply in the region to more than 17,000 rooms across nine brands, with another 70 projects in the pipeline and shows our continued commitment to strategically expanding our footprint, particularly in resort destinations and key international markets
We're also taking full advantage of our global scale to roll out industry-leading innovations
Guests continue to prefer our web-direct channels, which made up nearly 30% of distribution mix in the first quarter
This is our highest level ever and web-direct continues to be our fastest growing channel, increasing more than 200 basis points in distribution mix year-over-year
Our Hilton Honors app is downloaded every eight seconds and is the highest rated travel app providing unprecedented choice and control for guests
Through this app, guests can check in, download their digital key on their mobile device and head straight to their self-selected room upon arrival
By the end of this year, we expect to have digital key capability at all of our hotels in 80 major North American markets and 2,500 hotels globally
In the first quarter, Honors members accounted for 57% of occupancy, up nearly 2 points year-over- year
Additionally, paid member folio increased more than 8% as new members join the program, and existing members move up the tiers, enabling us to capture an even greater percentage of their travel wallet
We ended up the first quarter with 63 million Honors members, up 19% year-over-year
Post-spins, we're a resilient fee-driven business with a very disciplined strategy that's focused on growing market share, units, and free cash flow per share, as well as preserving our strong balance sheet and accelerating our return of capital
We estimate a 1 point change in RevPAR growth impacts our adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 1 point, roughly the same as every 10,000 net unit adds on a stabilized basis
This year, we expect to add 50,000 to 55,000 net new rooms with great sight lines for the next couple of years, given that we have nearly 170,000 rooms currently under construction
Given the resiliency of our model, modest changes in RevPAR do not meaningfully impact our free cash flow generation potential, and we intend to be very disciplined in returning capital to shareholders
To provide more clarity, we expect to return $900 million to a $1 billion to shareholders this year with around $200 million in the form of quarterly dividends, and the full balance in share repurchases
At our core and critical to our continued success, we are a business of people serving people, and our team members strive to provide exceptional experiences at every hotel, for every guest, every time
I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work and commitment to our shared purpose to be the most hospitable company in the world
Hilton was again named one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For
Our inclusion on Fortune's list is a very prestigious ranking and I think a fantastic acknowledgement of where we stand when measured against the top companies in the U.S
and around the world
This ranking is also representative of our exceptional workplace culture
Ranking at number 26 in the U.S
, we increased our position by 30 places this year and we ranked number 17 globally
We're really proud of this important recognition
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin, who'll give you a little bit more details on the quarter and our outlook
Good morning, Felicia
Yeah, that's a great question, and I think one that's on everybody's mind to sort of get to the fundamentals of what's going on with demand in the business
What I would say is, breaking it apart into the two segments
First on the transient side, we've seen it in the leisure transient remained relatively healthy
We haven't seen lot of ebb and flow there, both pre and post elections
If you think about pre and post election with business transient, which had increasingly pre-election, I think, we all know become quite anemic to flattish
Post-election, we saw it step up a little bit
And we've seen it remain pretty consistent since
So, we saw a little bit of post-election bump and it's remained, I mean week by week obviously things move around, but if you have sort of cleansed the data, our read of the data is it's been relatively consistent
We haven't seen any further pickup
I think my opinion is there is potential to see further pickup
I mean, you're looking at some â€“ while the GDP print in the first quarter was quite weak, there is certainly I think still an expectation that GDP growth, as I said in my prepared comments is going to be better this year than last year
If you look at non-residential fixed investment numbers, which have a very high correlation to demand growth in the hotel business, the fourth quarter of last year was the first quarter in a while you all saw it go positive, and the first quarter was quite positive
I mean, it's almost â€“ it's very high single-digits
Now, if you look at the data, generally, improvement in business transient will be in a lag to that â€“ to non-residential fixed investment numbers going up
So, I think if you look at those numbers, there's a bit of a reason for optimism
I think ultimately time will tell
I mean, it's early in the year, it's early in the Trump administration and this legislative agenda
And I think we need to see it play out
I think to see it go from a little bit of a bump post-election to see further upside, I think you have to see some things settle down
There's still a decent amount of uncertainty around certain foreign policy issues going on and the legislative agenda, health care, tax reform, infrastructure, the regulatory
I think the regulatory is pretty stable and I think people view that as quite positive
Healthcare, unclear, maybe have clarity in the short-term
Tax policy, a lot of work being done on that and a lot of thinking going on on infrastructure
So, I think as those things play out and you have a little bit more certainty, particularly if it's viewed as positive in the business community, and I would say tax reform being the most important of those, I think there is potential to see incremental increases
Again, having said that, what we're seeing is relative stability at the moment
On the group side, which we've had tons of questions about, not surprisingly there's been lot of dialogue about it over the last week or so
What I would say is we feel pretty good about the group side
I'd say if you look at system wide group performance in the first quarter, we covered it in the prepared comments, frankly it was a lot better than we thought it would be
In that, of course, you had the Easter effect which helped but we knew the Easter effect was coming
It was better even factoring for the Easter effect
If we look at the full year forecast for what we think for group at the moment, it's a bit a better than it would have been a quarter ago or two quarters ago
So, that we feel good about that
If we look at our current position, system-wide on the books we feel pretty good about it and it certainly supports what we think we need to deliver in the group side for the year
If you look at the pace numbers, which I think people have been focused on, you got to parse those really carefully because everybody sort of defines it in slightly different way
So, I would sort of break it down maybe into three categories
Pace in the quarter, in the first quarter, for the quarter â€“ in the quarter, so very short-term group business was actually up quite nicely, okay
So that was positive
Pace in the quarter for the full year of 2017 was down marginally
That should be expected and it follows the pattern that we've seen over this recovery in the last few years, which is you'd very occupancy levels, you're lapping over high occupancy levels, you have 85% of your group business on the books and so sort of the math â€“ the math on that is you would generally see some of the pace and position numbers decline a little bit as the year goes on
Another I think really important pace number is looking at in the quarter â€“ in the first quarter what were bookings like for all future periods, not just this year, but into the â€“ in the future years
And that was up pretty meaningfully
So again, I think generally support of a feeling reasonably good about group
April, we got the date on the last couple of days
Pace was up quite nicely in April, obviously the beginning of the second quarter
By the way April overall, even though you have the reverse of the Easter effect, I will say performance wise, April is better than we thought it would be
And as we look at in the 2018, 2019, the position is quite â€“ is quite strong, so maybe more than you wanted to know, but I know a lot of questions on this
I think that we feel fine relative to the range of guidance that we've given overall, and I think group's contribution to that, I think we feel â€“ we feel good about group for the year, and group going forward
That's a good question, I would say
I don't think that we're fully getting the benefits of the network effect
It depends where you are in a world where â€“ where we built out, places where we built out, broader distribution we are getting more of the benefit
But there is â€“ none of them have been built out to the same degree as, Steve, as we have in the U.S
So, I think that there is certainly opportunity there
I mean, one gauge, I don't have the exact numbers in my head, but I'll tell you if you look at our average market share in the U.S
versus the other mega regions, the other mega regions have very good market share, and rapidly approaching the market share of the U.S
, but not quite there
So I think there is still more opportunity in that regard
I think as time goes on by just by definition of the scale of our existing footprint and the size of the population centers outside the U.S
and our under-representation, I mean we're in 104 countries in the world
We are in a lot of places, but we are at the tip of our iceberg of international growth
If you just do the math that's increasingly over the next 5 years or 10 years, you're going to see our percentage growth coming from other places around the world
So we're really â€“ I mean, we look at these market share numbers, as you can imagine every week, we visit with our teams around the world
And I have been really pleased in the last two years or three years that those market share numbers are supporting our theory of the network effect that as we're building out broader distribution in other parts of the world, that we are rapidly sort of approaching similar market share numbers
But in terms of ultimate growth potential, I think the sky is the limit
I mean, you think about the populations around the world that we can serve and you think about the layering of existing brands, let alone newer brands that we're launching
We have tremendous and I would say sort of, certainly for my lifetime, unlimited opportunity to continue to grow
Yeah, I mean, I said that
I think they are both on an annual basis, quarter-by-quarter moves around
I think they are both within a couple of hundred basis points of the other mega region, EMEA and APAC are within a 100 basis points, 200 basis points of the U.S
and they've been moving up materially over the last few years at a rapid pace
Good morning
Certainly I don't believe it can be easily copied
I think Harry it's a complicated answer, obviously
But I think at its core it's about having better more consistent brands, which means product that is in each and every one of the brands and categories consistent service delivery that is consistent, ultimately a commercial platform that is hitting on all cylinders, all elements of sales in our res systems and revenue management and our online business and marketing and all of those things sort of coming together to drive performance
And then the other thing that it is not easily replicable is you can have really good products, really consistent service and good commercial engines, but in my humble opinion, without having a network effect, meaning having broad price point distribution as well as geographic distribution, you just by definition can't take as much of a share of wallet from customers and as a consequence you can't drive the same level of market share
So, it's all of those things, which of course I'm going to say, I run the company and we are going say that we think they're unique
We don't think â€“ we think we are one of a very limited number of people that have a real network effect
And in terms of having the purest brand portfolio in the business, we think we got it, meaning that every one of our brands in every category is either the leader or a category killer in its segment
There is no dogs in the bunch
So when owners come to us for various needs that they have, where they are following demand patterns, whatever those might be or whatever type of product or price point, we have a great product to give them, where we're going to drive consistently market-leading market share and that's what they're investing in
They are investing in a system to drive top-line and bottom-line performance and drive the best return
I think the fact that we've been able to lead the industry in driving growth and doing it organically without having to use our balance sheet in any meaningful way, it's a pretty darn good testimonial to that
Now we have to keep doing it
So, we have to make sure that as we launch new products they're great products, that they really resonate with customers, that we have consistency and the high quality, that service delivery
I said we're a business of people serving people and we are â€“ service delivery matters a lot
But that network effect of connecting all of those dots around geography and price point matters a whole lot and I think ultimately what we have is awfully unique
Good morning, Joe
Those, yeah
I probably can't answer the second, I'll ask Kevin to take a shot at it, but the â€“ in terms of the first, the numbers are accurate
We're up construction starts 50%, I do not think that we will be up 50% in construction starts for the full year, okay, just to be clear
That is an accurate data point, I think for the year, it will be less than that
What's driving the first quarter and that's going to help us a lot in the year is I think that we're sort of firing on all cylinders in all segments, but the thing that really accelerated first quarter was Tru, new brand launch, lots of Trus getting under construction
It's the lowest price point we have in terms of cost per room to build, much more financeable than a lot of other products in a financing market that, is sort of stable, but got a little bit tighter, it remains a little bit tighter
So I think proportionally we're getting more of the financing dollars
The other driver of it was huge good things going on in China with limited service, particularly with our deal with Plateno, a ton of new Hamptons that went under construction in the first quarter and we're going to have a ton more coming, but my sense is, it will stabilize out that the Tru and the Hampton in China help supercharge the first quarter a bit
In terms of the 325,000 in the pipeline, it will be under construction, certainly half of it â€“ that would be financed, half of it's under construction, so it's financed
So I would say somewhere around the order of 60% to 70% because there is a 10% or 20% and I'm sort of guesstimating that would be on the verge of getting under construction or probably committed, so conservatively I'd probably say 60%
That's a good question
I'd say we're probably tracking in that zone
There is no ways week-to-week and month-to-month, but I'd say we're in the 1% to 2% zone and as we were sitting around every Monday morning, and I started with EC call with all of our senior folks from around the world, I did it yesterday like I do every Monday and we go through the performance in every major regions of the world
And I'd say there's generally a level â€“ a decent level of optimism in all of our â€“ from all of our folks coming out of April where if we look at all of the regions I think everybody felt like April was trending better and as they go into May and June, they're feeling reasonably good
So, to get to the higher level of range, I'd say right now and we gave you 2 point range in outcome because it's early in the year, okay
And I think that's the prudent thing to do
If you put me on the spot a little bit, where â€“ if I had to refine that more or where do I think it'll be, honestly what I see right now real time in talking to our teams and looking at the data, I would say we'd be at the mid to the high point
That's what forecasting, current forecasting would suggest
Now, there is a lot to play out in the year
There is a lot going on
We talked about legislative agenda, foreign policy
But we've got â€“ it's not roaring, but we got pretty good stability in the range of outcome that we talk about and business transient, leisure transient hanging in there and I gave you a long soliloquy on group that makes me feel with our position in group for the rest of this year reasonably good that it's going to deliver what we want to deliver there
So yeah, we're in that zone and I will say we feel good about delivering or suggesting we're going to deliver
I mean, we're really sort of in the 20% or 25% of free cash flow
So, as the free cash flow goes up, I think there could be some modest increases in the dividend
I would guide you to not expect that this year
I mean, I think we're going to be stable with where we are
But there we'll be potential in future years as free cash flow goes up
I mean, we â€“ as you probably gathered from our commentary, we're a lot more focused on returning capital in the form of buybacks
We obviously want to have a dividend, we want yield investors to be able to invest in the stock
But in terms of driving great, sort of market leading total returns to shareholders over a long period of time, we think being relatively modest on the dividend side and much more robust as robust as we can on the buyback side is going to lead to the best long-term returns
It is definitely a little bit early, and it's wait-and-see
I mean they've thrown some things out there, and we've had some pretty good discussions with folks that are on the point on this to get a bit of a sense of what's going on behind the scenes
I think they're darn serious about getting something done, and I would not at all be surprised if when we finish this year it is something done or something is pretty well baked in getting done
I think from my point of view, whatever they're going to do â€“ all of the options that we're looking at I think are going to be good for our business
I think now it could turn out a different way but certainly everything that's sort of being fancied about, the net result for us is positive, meaning that it's going to ultimately drive more free cash flow
And so it doesn't really change in any way our capital allocation policy, it just may change the amount of capital that we have to allocate, meaning if taxes go down, free cash flow goes up
Our belief is and our strategy will be to return all of that cash flow back to shareholders too again largely in the form of incremental buyback
So, I think same plan, just may have â€“ if they get something good done, we'll have more to play with
Well, I mean, that's a complicated question and I am not exactly sure there is a succinct way of answering and I think it's sort of a combo platter of everything
I mean, our model now as we've talked about is pretty simplified, I mean, it's really focused on continuing to do everything we can with our brands, and our commercial strategies to drive share
So we drive unit growth, and if we do those two things and outperform, we're going to drive incremental cash flow, which we're going to give back to shareholders
And so, there are a whole bunch of things sort of bubbling around the industry that are going to contribute to that, whether that be on OTA renegotiations over time, which will obviously continue to take place, whether that be finding other distribution partners that are very efficient distribution partners, that allow us to have access to new customer bases
Importantly, our direct strategies, which we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, and are going to be strategies that go far into the future, this evolution of Honors and having it be a real club that everybody wants to be a member of has a real value for both frequent and infrequent travelers, there is a huge amount of opportunity still left there to continue to take, what, 30% online business and grow it to a much higher share of our business
So, there are multitude of things that we're going to do
On the commercial side, there are multitude of things that we're going to continue to do with our existing brands to make sure they continue to be relevant
New brands, which we've talked about, we've launched one this year, we've got four more in the skunkworks which obviously will help us deliver from a Hilton point of view incremental growth, but importantly it's going to help us further that network effect that I talked about to give us an opportunity to serve you and more of our existing customers, bring new customers into the fold
So, there is a bunch of company specific, industry related things that we're going to do, but it's â€“ again I can go on for a long time, it's a complex strategy, but the ultimate goal and sort of the holy grail is share, you know, it's all of those things are â€“ so that we can drive incremental share to drive incremental profitability to owners, so they want to continue to invest tens of billions of dollars in our system
Your line is breaking up unfortunately
I think on the margin it's stable
I think throughout the second half of last year and maybe a little bit of this year, but really second half of last year, it became incrementally
The market became a little tighter, a little harder, terms were a little tougher, the loan-to-values were a little lower, pricing a little higher, all of those things
My sense in talking to our development teams and lots of owners is that it's relatively stable
Certainly I would say relatively stable for the owners that are very good borrowers that have been out doing this as a part of their business over an extended period of time
So from the last quarter, not any material change
For the full year, the numbers are fine
But yeah, this is small enough system where you have a couple of hotels have a huge impact
Not really
In preparation for the group â€“ the call, I'm going through our quarter-end numbers, I had our sales folks in here ask them the very same question
Nothing really stood out
They said it's been generally consistent as between industries
I mean, maybe with the energy sector being the exception where you're starting to see a little bit of outperformance relative to where it's been given what's going on in the energy sector, but otherwise pretty consistent
I don't have that data
My recollection, they can look for it, my recollection is that was up modestly
I don't want to get into specifics, so just a couple of random things we can talk a little bit more about, specifics if you want offline
Yeah
I think we've tried to be abundantly clear on what we intend to do this year at this point, $900 million to $1 billion total minus $200 million in dividends
So, $700 million to $800 million of buybacks, all of which we're doing essentially programmatically
The course we're on we just I think began the program on March 8, because we had to get the approvals from our board of directors, and all those things that you guys saw
So, I think where if you were to look at what we did in the month of April, March and April combined, I think we're on a trajectory to sort of be in that range and if we're not, we'll will obviously adjust the range
A large part of that period of time was under a plan that we couldn't alter because we were in a quiet period
So, it was clicking along based on a predetermined grid
We can obviously now post-earnings adjust that grid and we will if appropriate to get to the numbers that we've talked about
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
Great
If you look at the broader trend, interestingly last year international revenues â€“ revenues from international arrivals was down about 3%
So it was off for a host of reasons
I'd say last year predominantly the strength of the dollar, maybe a little bit what was going on post election, but there wasn't a whole lot of year left post election, so I think it was predominantly dollar
If you look at it in the first quarter, which is obviously at this point the only data that we have, revenues from international inbound business was actually up a little bit, I mean not a lot, I mean it's sort of flat to up 1% and it-- but it's not consistent from the various places around the world
But if you look at the â€“ you break the world apart, it was up from Canada and up from Asia Pacific
It was down from Mexico and down from the Middle East
I think in part related to some of the things that are going on politically, the net of which was â€“ it was up a little bit
I think where the dollar is today, and some of the other things that are going on, our expectation is for this full year that you're going to see international business down a little bit, maybe sort of circa notwithstanding was up in the first quarter, maybe circa where it was in â€“ where it was for the last year
Now, a lot of things can play out and change â€“ change that outcome, strengthening or weakening of the dollar
The dollar has sort of backed up a little bit, which is helping
Now, we're getting ancillary benefit
Europe now is a decent chunk of our business, and arrivals with the weakening of the pound over time, and these are the things that are going on
You've seen that-- part of the reason you're seeing Europe surge and have such strength and why it's an expectation of being performance wise above the high end of our guidance ranges
So, we do pick some of the back up over there now
As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, it's about 5% of our system wide business
So, it's moving, obviously being positive is always better, but these are the types of movements that we're talking about don't have a material impact on the bottom line result, and certainly don't have any material impact on our ability to drive cash flow
Good morning
I think we talked about it a little bit on the last call, and the update is that we are still in our process
We went out and we did an RFP
I think the good news is we're nearing the end of that process
I am hopeful that we're actually going to be able to get it done in the second quarter
We're in fairly advanced stages of negotiation, so I'm not going to be able to give you any sense of where it's going to end up, because we're not done
I will say at a high level, I think it's going to be very good for everybody involved, meaning I think it's going to be great for our customers, because we're going to create a customer value proposition that's far better than what we have today, which I think ultimately is good for them, and will help us drive incremental share
It's going to be great for our overall system in terms of driving more business into the system, and it's going to be great for us in the sense of driving more fees from that segment of our business
I know you'd like to know what it is, but it's not done, and so I'm going to stop there, and when we get it done, we'll give you a little bit better sense of it
Good morning, Bill
You are talking about the U.S
Yeah
I think if you look-- Bill, it's a great question
If you look at our pipeline and compare to any of the major competitors, so you look at the overall numbers across the entire U.S
system, you're seeing the bulk of the development go on in a limited-service space
There is a real simple reason for it
You and I, and I think everybody knows it
And that's â€“ that is â€“ that's where the demand growth is, that's where the economics work and that's why owners are investing money to build new properties in those segments because they're getting the returns there
And when you look at the costs to build and to operate and cost to build new construction for full service and luxury, it works in a few places, but it doesn't work in many
I mean, we have â€“ we have a bunch of stuff going on
I think we have more luxury stuff going on in the U.S
We just opened Conrad in Chicago, we're getting to go under construction in DC, the Waldorf Beverly Hills is going to open next month
I mean, if you add up we get going out in the U.S
in luxury, probably â€“ I think more than anybody, upper upscale, we are doing great relative to our competitive set
There're just not a lot of it going on because it's not justified because construction costs continue to go up throughout the Great â€“ after the Great Recession and through now in a way where it makes it in most markets quite difficult
Having said that, in terms of our existing stock of hotels, we're very focused and have been on making sure that we're keeping those up to snuff
So in the end, while we're are not â€“ this development cycle doesn't involve a ton of-- of upper upscale and luxury, for us or anybody by the way, it doesn't mean that we're not cycling through and being very thoughtful about the existing products we have whether that'd be DoubleTree, Hilton, Embassy or above and making sure that we're doing everything we need to do to make sure that the product is relevant and that it ultimately can be competitive
And so I feel great about what we've been doing in the capital investment side with our owners because particularly now post-spin, this is not -- we are not the owner of anything in the U.S
market, but if you go around and look at what's opening, you go around and look at what we're refurbishing around the country, I feel really good about, but this is â€“ this is a phenomena that's driven by underlying economics
And I'm not going to say that at same point you're eventually going to get back in the full service and luxury development at a larger scale
I don't know if it's in this cycle though because I don't see economics that on a wholesale basis are going to support it for some time
And again selectively it's being supported because we're obviously doing some of it, and so are our competitors, but wholesale, I think the game is in limited service, and I think that's an important nuance to our model because I know there's noise out in the market from competitors and the like â€“ I think in the end our model is a capital-light model and ultimately we're trying to serve customers and the way we serve customers is giving the products they want, in the locations they want it with service delivery that is in keeping with the particular price point that they're â€“ that they're willing to pay for
And given that we're not investing, we're investing â€“ it's third parties that's investing this capital
What we're doing around the world is following demand patterns and the capital is following that demand pattern
And so in the U.S
that means a lot of limited service
By the way, around the world that means a lot of limited service
It doesn't mean that we're not going to do tons of luxury, and upper upscale and all those things, it just means that, with a growing middle class around the world, a huge amount in the next 5 years or 10 years or 20 years of demand growth is going to be in the mid-market
And by the way, I'm very proud to say we are really happy to serve the mid-market, particularly given that every time we add one, it's a 100% margin and an infinite yield
So, the more we do, the more money we make
And the more money you make and the better we serve our customers and the greater network effect that we create
Again, that's not to say we're not going to do tons of Hiltons and Embassys and DoubleTrees and Conrads and Waldorfs
We're going to do those too when the economic rationale supports it and we can deliver for owners' returns commensurate with their investment
I think the idea is we'll keep it roughly the same, unless something really radical happens
I would never say never, we want to be intelligent depending on what happens in the world
But based on everything, we are hearing that is possible in terms of outcome, it would not change our philosophy on the dividend
You bet
Thanks, everybody, again for joining us this morning
It's great to be in our new simplified model reporting here in the first quarter and I think it was really solid results
We appreciate the time and attention and all the great questions and look forward to catching up with you after the second quarter
