10,"Our total company gross margin was 34% for the quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from last year"
11,The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors

13,"Second, we had 15 basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher shrink than one year ago"
14,"And finally, we had approximately 3 basis points of gross margin contraction, due mainly to a change in the mix of products sold"
15,"For the year, we experienced 3 basis points of gross margin contraction"
16,"In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 113 basis points to 20.8%"
17,Our expense leverage was driven principally by our strong sales performance and good expense control

30,"During the year, we invested approximately $1.62 billion back into the business through capital expenditures"

34,"Now looking ahead, this morning we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal 2017."
35,And I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights
36,"Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so our fiscal 2017 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2016."
37,"As we look to 2017, we remain encouraged by the strength of our core business and by what we are seeing in the housing environment"
38,"While private fixed residential investment as a percentage of GDP now stands at 3.8%, it has a way to go before it reaches the historical mean of 4.5%"
39,"Home price appreciation, housing turnover, and household formation continue to be tailwinds for our business"
40,"Using our directionally-correct but imperfect sales forecasting model, we are planning for fiscal 2017 sales to grow by approximately 4.6%"
41,Sales growth at Interline and the opening of six new stores in 2017 will not materially change our overall growth rate
42,So our 2017 comp sales guidance is the same as our overall sales growth guidance
43,Now one last comment on our sales growth guidance
44,It is based on 2016 average U.S
45,dollar foreign exchange rates
46,"If exchange rates remain where they are today, there is about $230 million of sales pressure to the guidance"
47,"For fiscal 2017, we are projecting our gross margin rate to decline by approximately 15 basis points from 2016, as we are planning for outpaced growth in lower-margin categories, such as Appliances and certain building material categories"
48,"On the expense front, we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately 49% of the rate of our sales growth, in line with the long-term guidance we provided to you in 2015."
49,"For the year, we expect that our operating margin will grow by approximately 30 basis points to 14.5%, reaching our fiscal 2018 target one year in advance of our goal"
50,We will update our fiscal 2018 operating margin target at our Investor Conference scheduled for later in the year
51,"For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%"
52,"Starting with fiscal 2017, we are adopting FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for employee share-based compensation"
53,"Note that the estimated positive impact of this new accounting standard is reflected in our projected tax rate, but the actual impact won't be fully understood until equity grants are exercised throughout the year"
54,We expect our fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 10.5% to $7.13.
55,"Now as Craig mentioned in his remarks, in support of our commitment to return value to shareholders, our board just announced a new share repurchase authorization of $15 billion, replacing our existing authorization"
56,Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to replace approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares during the year using excess cash
57,"For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $11.3 billion"
58,Our 2017 capital spending plan is approximately $2 billion
59,We will use this capital to support our strategic initiatives and invest in our aging store base to improve the customer experience
60,"In addition to capital spending and share repurchases, we will use our cash to pay $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders"
61,"As Craig mentioned, our board just announced an increase in our targeted dividend payout ratio from what was 50% to now 55%"
62,"With that, we announced a 29% increase on our quarterly dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $3.56."
63,Our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to be evidenced by the investments we are making in our business and the cash return to shareholders
64,We thank you for your participation in today's call
65,"And, Catherine, we are now ready for questions"
66,Question-and-Answer Session
67,And maybe I'll just add a little color about our sales forecasting model
68,"As you know, it starts with GDP growth forecasts, and for the U.S"
69,", GDP is projected to grow by 2.3% in 2017."
70,"We then add to that the benefits we believe we will get from rising home prices, housing turnover, and household formation"
71,And we think housing will add another point-and-a-half growth to our overall growth next year
72,"To that, we have added a little bit of share shift in Appliances and certain building categories"
73,"And just to put that in perspective, in 2016, Appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth"
74,So that gives you a sense of the share that we're including in our guidance
75,"And then we're adding something else this year that we haven't included in the past, and that's what we call the cumulative wealth effect of home price appreciation"
76,"If you look at home equity, since 2011, home equity is up 108%"
77,"On average, that equates to $50,000 per household"
78,"And we believe that's contributing â€“ as people use the equity of their house to spend back into their house, we believe that's contributing to our growth, so we factor that into our guidance, and that's how we got to the 4.6%"
79,So let me walk you through how we got to our guidance for 2017.
80,"As we commented, in 2016, our expenses grew at 30% of our sales growth rate"
81,A bit of that was distorted because of payment data breach expenses that were incurred in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016.
82,"So if you ignore the payment data breach, our expenses in 2016 grew at about 38% â€"
83,"“ call it, 40% of our sales growth rate"
84,It's stepping up to 50% in 2017 for a few reasons
85,"We, like many companies, are facing rising wages, as well as higher medical costs, and we have factored that into our guidance"
86,"It doesn't mean that we won't drive productivity to offset some of that pressure like we have historically, but we have factored that into our guidance"
87,"Further, we're seeing some cost pressure coming in from property taxes in certain states like California, so we factored that into our guidance"
88,"And finally, because our capital spending is stepping up slightly year on year, there's a bit of expense associated with that"
89,"But as you know, productivity is a virtuous cycle at The Home Depot, so we always try to do better"
90,"Well, I'll start with the growth assumptions and then we can talk about the performance"
91,"On the growth assumptions, we are assuming that Interline will grow faster than the company average in 2017, which was true in the fourth quarter as well"
92,"But remember, Interline is less than 2% of our total sales"
93,"So it just rounds out at the end of the day, and that's why our comp sales guidance is the same as our total sales guidance for 2017."
94,I think PFRI is a great indicator of the health of the overall market
95,"And as you can see, it is a healthy market"
96,"We are a big part of it, aren't we?"
97,Because improvements â€
98,"“ if you look at the components of PFRI, improvements is one of the big components and we're part of improvements"
99,"So in a way, it's a bit circular"
100,"I'm not sure that it's a great predictive tool, but it certainly is a great indicator of the health"
101,"Now, here's a really fun fact â€"
102,“ and I know you know this because you've done all the research in this area
103,"If PFRI were to return to the mean of 4.5% and GDP remain the same, we'd have to grow about 18.5%"
104,"And assuming there's no share shift for The Home Depot, that's a $16 billion opportunity for us"
105,So will we get all those sales?
106,"I don't know, but it certainly suggests as the housing market continues to recover, there's growth ahead for The Home Depot"
107,Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
108,LLC
109,Okay
110,Thank you for that
111,"Well, as you know, we like to look at our business from a half and not a quarter because of what we call the bathtub effect"
112,You're never really sure when spring will land
113,"If we look at the split by half, we would expect the first half to be slightly lower than the back-half of the year"
114,"As you know, we're up against a tough comparison in the first quarter, particularly the month of February, where last year we had a U.S"
115,comp of 11.8%
116,"I will tell you, Chris, we planned for a positive comp in February"
117,We are beating our plan
118,"It's early in the quarter, of course, but we're feeling very good about our business"
119,"On the working capital front, we expect working capital to be a source of cash for the business in 2017, and we're planning for inventory turns to improve two-tenths year-on-year"
120,"Well, first of all, I will say it's a minor change; about four-tenths of growth year-on-year"
121,"Secondly, our forecasting model is directionally correct, but at the beginning of 2016, it certainly didn't predict a 6.2% comp in the United States"
122,So we use all these factors to build a model to give us a sense of where we're going
123,"There's another factor out there that we look at, but we haven't incorporated, but we're spending more time trying to understand, and that's the leading indicator of remodeling activity that's published by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies"
124,"If you look at that, and I'm sure you have, you can see that it's suggesting growth rates higher than the guidance that we've provided"
125,"So no matter how we look at it, we're very confident with the sales forecast that we've given"
126,"One other data point, if I may"
127,"If you look at sales by category, peak to trough, while we've more than fully recovered everything we lost during the downturn, we haven't recovered every category"
128,"We still have $1.4 billion of sales that haven't fully recovered, and those are in low-margin categories"
129,"We want that to grow, and if housing continues to grow, it will"
130,"Yeah, our analysis would show that for every 25-basis point increase in mortgage rates, it costs the homeowner who's applied for a mortgage $40 more per month"
131,So that helps sort of dimensionalize the pressure associated with rising rates
132,"With the median home price in the country of $250,000, mortgage rates could go up to 7-ish percent before the Affordability Index would fall at 100 or below"
133,So there's (42:45) a way to go before we'd be concerned
134,"And you know what, mortgage rates stand today at 4.2%, 4.3%, something like that, the historical mean is 5.8%"
135,"So even if a return to the mean, you're still below that inflection point"
136,"We joke, we are Pro"
137,I wouldn't read anything to shrink for the year
138,Shrink was up 1 basis point
139,This is just a year-over-year comparison
140,The comparison is correct
141,We are planning to spend the capital that we are guiding to of $2 billion
142,It's about 2% of sales
143,"And as you think about capital for our business going forward, if you want to model 2% of sales, I think that would be a good number to use"
144,"We're investing in the initiatives that we've shared with you, be it interconnected retail, supply chain; we are also investing into our stores"
145,"As Craig pointed out, 45% of our online orders are picked up inside of our stores, that means we need to do some reconfiguration to hold those orders, and make sure the experience is right"
146,We did a lot of work with our customers this summer and got some good feedback from our customers about things we could do differently in our stores
147,"So 500 of our stores will be receiving what we call a new store environment,"
148,"(47:43) lighting, the floors are going to be polished up"
149,"The stores are relevant, we want to keep them that"
150,"It's $11 million in the quarter, $37 million for the year, $298 million life to date, and I think we're done"
151,We're happy about that
152,Thank you
153,"Yeah, if you look at where the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio stands today, there's $2 billion of borrowing availability"
154,"It's not our intent to let that ratio decline, which it will if we don't lever back up"
155,The interest rate environment is still very attractive
156,We're very pleased with how we've utilized debt financing to supplement our cash to buy back our share
157,So certainly not suggesting that anything is going to change off of our past practice
158,"And certainly, Craig, you commented on what we're doing with freight inside the store"
159,No material change to what you've seen in the past several years
