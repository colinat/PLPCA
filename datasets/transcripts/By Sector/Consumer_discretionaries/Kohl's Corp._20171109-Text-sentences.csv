0,"Thanks, Bruce"
1,"Let me start with a few comments on the overall results for the quarter, and then I'll provide more color and the progress we're making around each of our key pillars and the Greatness Agenda"
2,"Most importantly, we returned to a positive comp increase in the third quarter and we continued the steady improvement in sales results we've seen all year"
3,"As you know, driving traffic is one of the two key priorities for our company"
4,"And as Bruce shared, there was sequential improvement again in our store traffic metrics and this increase in traffic"
5,was the driver of our improved sales performance
6,"From a timing perspective in the quarter, we had a strong back-to-school selling season with sales from the beginning of August through Labor Day, up low single-digit"
7,"This was driven by particularly strong performance in kids and footwear, and continued strength in Activewear"
8,"The rest of the September sales period was weak, affected substantially by the impact of hurricanes in some of our regions and unseasonably warm weather throughout almost all of our regions"
9,"Sales turned positive again in October, driven by particular strength in the back half of the month"
10,"Regular price sales for the quarter were up 1%, while clearance sales were down 7%"
11,This was driven by lower levels of clearance inventory
12,"On an overall basis, a portion of our improvement in our sales trend is attributable to our targeted efforts to capture share from competitive store closures in some of our trade areas"
13,"And we expect this will continue, if not accelerate, through the holiday seasons"
14,"From a category standpoint, the positive comp performance was broad-based with nearly all categories improving their sales trends"
15,"Menâ€™s, footwear, kids in home, all reported positive comp increases in the quarter"
16,"Our core womenâ€™s business was negative, but we did see continuing improvement in the trend, particularly in our private brands"
17,The accessories category continued to lag the company was down mid single-digit
18,"Looking at our progress on our individual key pillars, on the product front, our active business increased almost 20% for the quarter, an acceleration of the year-to-date trend"
19,"Both apparel and footwear categories in Active were strong and this was driven by large increases in both Nike and Adidas, as well as continued strong performance from Under Armour"
20,We continue to gain market share in Active and we expect the very strong holiday performance in both Active apparel and footwear categories
21,"Our national brand penetration rose to 56% for the quarter, up 300 basis points"
22,"This was driven primarily by the Active growth, but we also had growth in several other important national brands, including Leviâ€™s, Carter's, Van Heusen, Tag Heuer, Columbia and Fitbit"
23,We also launched the Clarks footwear brand to further expand our footwear offering
24,Our private brand performance saw significant improvement and substantially all brands reported improve trends
25,This was driven by the growing impact of our speed to market efforts and improved performance of our Jumping Beans
26,childrenâ€™s brand at back-to-school and the re-launch of our Apartment 9 brand
27,"Our exclusive brand performance continued to lag the total, but thatâ€™s primarily result the paring down of brands and categories in that area of the business"
28,"Two of our most important exclusive brands, Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad, grew by double-digits for both the quarter and year-to-date"
29,"In our efforts to provide a seamless and easy experience, we continue to make great progress in delivering the best in class omnichannel experience"
30,Online generated demand sales grew 15% for the quarter and we continued to grow the percentage of those online orders that are fulfilled by stores
31,Stores fulfilled 30% of the total units for the quarter with both Opus and ship from store growing significantly compared to last year
32,"Productivity metrics improved again, resulting in lower cost of shipping and fulfillment as a percent of total digital sales, which aided profitability"
33,"We also opened our 5th DFC, which we expect to contribute significantly to our ability to grow our business and improve efficiency, beginning next year"
34,Improved experiences in our mobile applications increased digital conversion at a low double-digit rate and mobile accounted for 67% of our traffic in the quarter
35,"In the area of personalization and savings, we continue to enhance our capability in using data and analytics to drive our marketing, digital and personalization efforts"
36,"In the quarter, we increased our level of personalization and key marketing events, as well as leveraged our new insight based pricing tools to deliver new promotional events that are resonating with our customers"
37,We completed the rollout of Your Price during the third quarter
38,Your Price shows the personalized price of individual items based on the customer specific offers and provides immediate visibility to the value of those customers receive at Kohl's
39,Our personalized search initiative makes it easier for customers to find what theyâ€™re looking for based on shopping preferences from previous online and in-store purchases
40,"And finally, our smartcard application continues to provide customers an opportunity to save more by choosing to pick-up in-store versus ship-to-home on their online orders"
41,"During our second quarter earnings call, I mentioned that we would pilot a further evolution of our loyalty program next year"
42,"Our royalty program includes the Kohl's Charge, Yes2You Rewards and Kohl's Cash Elements"
43,"The objective of the pilot is to simplify the program, broaden the reach and provide even more rewards to users in a program that already is best-in-class"
44,"With over 30 million unique customers utilizing at least one of the elements of our loyalty program, we believe this next evolution has great opportunity to drive a step change in traffic and sales"
45,The timing of the pilot has now been set for the second quarter of next year and approximately 100 stores will participate
46,We would then include the learning from this pilot in an expected companywide roll out intended for fiscal 2019.
47,"Finally, in the area of store optimization"
48,We continue to make progress in amplifying the role and the relevancy of our physical stores across a number of fronts
49,Success many of these efforts has built further conviction and the importance of our physical stores and our long-term success
50,"First, we opened four new 35,000 square foot stores in dense trade areas in the third quarter, and the openings were extremely successful"
51,We now have 12 of these stores across the country in both secondary and major markets
52,"Beyond the potential for growth these stores provide us, they importantly provide us insights into how we can operate our other stores more effectively in the future"
53,"Second, our standard to small store strategy continues to drive lower inventory levels and is resulting in improved profitability in over 300 of our stores"
54,"As Bruce indicated, inventory per store at the end of the third quarter was down low single-digits and is expected to be down mid single-digits at the end of the year"
55,This is our seventh consecutive quarter of lower inventory per store
56,"And on two years stack basis, our inventories are down in the low teens"
57,"More importantly, we still believe we have the ability for future multi-year contraction in our average inventory per store"
58,"Obviously, thereâ€™s significant positive implication for improving our work getting capital and our cash flow metrics"
59,"Third, in the last quarter, we continued to refine the opportunity on rightsizing some of our lower volume full size stores with new tenants base being developed as a result"
60,You should expect to hear further developments on this effort in the fourth quarter call as we expand this
61,"We also continue to test and iterate our future store experience through our Your Store initiative, and weâ€™ll share more details on this initiative on the fourth quarter call as well"
62,"Finally, there have been a number of questions regarding the test of Amazon smart home experiences in 10 of our stores, and Amazon returns at goals in maybe two of our stores"
63,Iâ€™m pleased to say that both test launched successfully in mid-October in select stores in the Chicago and the Los Angeles markets
64,"At this time, we wonâ€™t share any other details in the test, beyond the store location"
65,And while this contained previously on our press release in the subject
66,But the objective from our perspective is very simple and very straight forward
67,"We believe both of these tests have the potential to drive incremental traffic to our stores, which as you know, is our number one priority"
68,"In summary, the third quarter showed continued improvement in our financial results"
69,We are on track to achieve the goals we established with investors at the beginning of the year
70,"Just as importantly, the results further reinforce to us"
71,that are two key priorities of the right ones
72,"On the number one priority of driving traffic, we feel weâ€™re very well positioned for the fourth quarter with lien and well balanced inventories, compelling products, more fully developed personalization tactics in place and a strong digital business trend going into a period when online demand is at the highest penetration of the year"
73,"On our other priory of operational excellence, we have made additional investments to support our long-term omnichannel strategy"
74,"These include moves like building out our fulfillment infrastructure, moving much of our technology to the cloud and launching new applications to make the customer experience easier"
75,"At the same time, weâ€™re innovating with new smaller store concepts, rightsizing some of our stores with other retailers and piloting concepts like our initiative with Amazon"
76,"In spite of these investments, we remain on track to reach or exceed our goal of $250 million in expense savings over the next three years"
77,Managing operations has always been strength for us
78,and we believe we can continue to build further on that
79,"And with that, Bruce and I will be happy to take your questions"
80,Question-and-Answer Session
81,"As it relates to the competitive activity, now competitive activity had no impact at all on our margin"
82,"From s margin perspective, as Bruce indicated in the call, gross margin obviously decreased and that was a function of certainly higher shipping cost due to the growth that we had online, that's not new"
83,"But also various reserves required simply because of when the timing of sales came, we had a lot of sales late in October that I think were probably driven by pent up demand during the weak September sales period"
84,Merchandize margin actually improved in the quarter and that was not a surprise to us
85,We had expected that
86,"So in terms of just managing our business, managing the mix of our business, managing our inventory levels that's really, for the most part, all good news from our perspective"
87,"Looking into the fourth quarter, I think you can probably tell from how weâ€™re describing our business trends that weâ€™re very confident about what's in front of us"
88,Our inventories are very lien
89,They were really well positioned
90,We had an very strong trend in the third quarter
91,We had a great trend coming out of the third quarter
92,"Our home business, which as you know, penetrates more highly in the fourth quarter than the rest of the year, is extremely strong"
93,I think it was up mid single-digits low to mid single-digits again in the third quarter as it has been for the year
94,"And very importantly, from our standpoint, our digital business grew double-digits again and as you know that this is for entering the most important quarter for digital"
95,So I think we're super confident as we go into the fourth quarter
96,"I think the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, the only thing we've really done in this quarter is to raise the low end of the earnings guidance up in recognition of the strong performance we've had all year"
97,"And the components of the guidance, I donâ€™t think really have much changed"
98,I donâ€
99,™t know if you have anything to add there
100,"The impact of ship from store and by online pick-up in store during in the fourth quarter is, as you can imagine, very high"
101,"And in particular, the impact of buy online pick-up in the store as we get closer to the holiday season accelerates really dramatically"
102,"So said another way, I guess, the changes that we've made and initiative we have put in place to drive customers to consider picking up in store, I think will pay us big dividends in the fourth quarter"
103,We tested smart card and then roll smart card to our desktop platform in the third quarter
104,And the results of that are very encouraging
105,"It is definitely driving increased decision making of customers to choose pick up in store, because we give them a benefit to do that"
106,"Well, I mean overall for-- and jump in here Bruce if I get this not exactly right"
107,But the overall for the fourth quarter weâ€™ve increased our marketing
108,That was planned to increase our marketing
109,We think we have a big business opportunity
110,"Clearly, leveraging marketing this year has been successful"
111,"I think for the year, weâ€™ve done a really good job in terms of leveraging marketing"
112,So Iâ€™m hopeful
113,that platform we have in place for the fourth quarter from marketing spend will continue to drive that
114,Some of the initiatives that we launch new in the third quarter for instance the tactics and strategy around taking advantage of competitorsâ€™ closures look to have paid dividends and those stores definitely outpace the company
115,and we got a lift in those stores
116,So I donâ€™t know if that answers everything for you
117,"Bruce, I donâ€"
118,™t know if you have anything to add
119,Vera Wang business is great
120,Itâ€™s been running super-strong all year long
121,"I suspect the effort that weâ€™re putting around celebrating the anniversary of our partnership with her is going to probably accelerate that, Bob"
122,And Vera is the largest and most important exclusive brand we have
123,So Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s going to help lift our exclusive brand sales
124,"Youâ€™ll probably remember from the call, the biggest improvement we had in our overall brand portfolio was in our private brands where speed to market some resurgence in our Jumping Beans business and the re-launch of Apartment 9"
125,drove that
126,"Overall exclusive brands have definitely trailed the company but the brands that weâ€™re betting on, brands like Vera or brands Lauren Conrad, those are growing dramatically"
127,Itâ€™s more a case of us editing and pairing down and eliminating categories or other brands that arenâ€™t performing
128,"I can probably answer the first part and then Bruce can answer the other part, Paul"
129,"Back-to-school, which we characterize from 1st of August through the Labor Day date, the 1st week of September"
130,We were up about 3%
131,"And there was consistent performance the whole quarter and consistent performance across the most important categories, things like footwear, Activewear and children's"
132,September was very weak from that point on
133,"So second week of September through 1st week or so of October, we were down low single-digits"
134,"But frankly, I attribute that completely and totally to certainly the hurricane"
135,"Bruce, I think quantified that to the best extent we can"
136,and we've got pretty good handle on that part
137,But also unseasonably warm weather
138,We had warm weather in all of our regions
139,So that part of the quarter really suffered as a result of both of those things happening
140,"And then the end of October, we were up again"
141,"So for October, we were up, let's say, closer to 1% with the end of October being stronger than that to drive that 1% number"
142,And there wasnâ€™t anything unusual
143,"Though, we did, I think as you know Paul in these kinds of seasonal businesses when you have periods of low demand due to weather and hurricanes then youâ€™re going to get pent up demand"
144,and it's going to come back stronger towards the end
145,"And to some extent, you can almost see that even in our gross margin performance because one of the reasons why our gross margin was down certainly shipping cost impacted gross margin, merchandize margin up, gross margin down, shipping cost was a factor than a factor all year of course"
146,"But the other big factor would just these end of quarter reserves and accruals we had to put in place because the sales came really, really late and thatâ€™s just sometime how it happens"
147,"And in this case, thatâ€™s how it happens"
148,So there wasnâ€™t anything unusual from a promotional perspective that we did to drive that
149,"On the first part in terms of the traffic drivers, like everything, Oliver, itâ€™s a multiple of factors that are going to lift our traffic continuing going forward"
150,"Some of it is of course very straight forward, which is all these efforts that we have in place around personalization and particularly in our digital marketing, which is now our largest marketing spend where weâ€™re delivering more specific offers based on customers past preferences and reaching them more directly"
151,"So I think thatâ€™s a big, big role"
152,"Product of course where retailers of product plays a massive role and as we think about driving traffic, having more relevant product in our stores, is a big part of, I think, the resurgence in traffic"
153,People are finding what they want more regularly
154,"I would say the third piece is, as you know, weâ€™ve made very large investments to be best in class from an omnichannel standpoint"
155,"And therefore, what we present to customers digitally online giving them access to everything we offer is a big component of this"
156,"And then giving them the opportunity to make the decision where they are going to buy it whether we ship it them whether from our stores at EFC, or they visit one of our stores to pick-up in store, I think that's probably the third big factor"
157,"In terms of the two businesses that have been lagging, I wouldnâ€™t want to get ahead of myself too far"
158,But I think I would say that we're more optimistic on our women's apparel business turning positive
159,You just see it in the trends
160,It's consistently improved
161,The private brand penetration in women's apparel is extremely high
162,"And therefore, when we start seeing improvement in our private brand performance, we can anticipate more improved performance in the overall women's apparel business"
163,I would be less optimistic on accessories
164,I think that's a tougher business for us right now
165,You can see it in the numbers
166,We talked about that in this call
167,But women's is an important component
168,And if we can get the women's business to move positively that is going to pay big dividends for our overall business
169,Oliver Cheng And our last question is on the loyalty evolution
170,"This is a really nice catalyst and opportunity as you simplify and embrace, and I'm sure you can leverage it to drive enhanced personalization, even more than youâ€™re doing"
171,So how -- what are some of the parameters around the test and the evolution?
172,Because it looks like you will have to integrate a lot of pieces
173,"I'm just curious about the opportunities and risk, and what you think will happen when you step change and embrace that?"
174,Thanks
175,"I mean, as we look at it, there is no risk"
176,We have -- we're building from a massively successful program to begin with
177,And what thatâ€™s allowed us to get is great insights and great information to build it better
178,"Fundamentally, in the easiest way possible, we talk about it by saying, hey, we got to simplify it, there is multiple components and so making it easier for customers to understand would help engage more people"
179,"We have to broaden it, meaning we have to reach more people outside of our charge base, because a large percentage of our loyalty program realizing that charge base"
180,"And then without question at all, we want to engage more over the course of time"
181,So I think our sense is that this is going to be a positive for the business
182,"Beyond that, the details of it, I think I would want to wait till the February call and weâ€™ll"
183,give you a lot more specificity around what the program looks like
184,I donâ€
185,"™t know if you have anything to add there, Bruce"
186,"On the second part of the question, I can definitely give you a quick answer, which is the drag due to shipping fulfillment was very typical of what we see each and every quarter"
187,So there is no change there
188,There is no change in trend
189,And it is pretty much as expected
190,"In the fourth quarter youâ€™re right, the penetration is much higher, I think Bruce has got the number roughly"
191,And of course that's all built into our forecast and our thinking in terms of how we give you the guidance
192,"Well, I mean fundamentally at the end of the day, what we believe is that weâ€™re going to get an increase in our merchandize margin"
193,Weâ€™ve had an increase in our merchandize margin
194,We expect to continue to have an increase in our merchandize margin
195,"And the reason though we do is, are the components of the merchandize margins are working in our favor"
196,"Inventories are better managed, inventories are leaner, inventories are more relevant because receipts see are coming closer to sales"
197,"And as a result of all of that, we have improved merchandize margin"
198,"And then of course, working against this is the headwind of shipping and fulfillment"
199,"But weâ€™ve done a pretty good job of anticipating that impact, and itâ€™s been very consistent"
200,So I would expect it to be consistent in the fourth quarter as well
201,"I mean, generally, I donâ€™t want to get over my skis on this"
202,"But generally, the warm weather in those four weeks in September negatively impacted sales in total for the quarter"
203,"And you see it because the seasonal categories, which are significant percentage of our total business, ran down, letâ€™s say,"
204,mid single-digits
205,"And in spite of that, we had a positive overall comp"
206,So thatâ€™s the main indicator that you have that it has an impact that puts the hurricane to the side thatâ€™s just looks at the seasonal categories
207,And then weâ€™ve continued to see strength
208,So you combine those two things together and you got to say that is a good signal
209,"Well, non-credit is definitely running better"
210,Itâ€™s leading
211,You can see that from a share perspective Kohlâ€™s Charges as a percentage of our total business
212,That is not by accident or by chance
213,"As you know, Chuck, weâ€™ve had a strong initiative in place to broaden the reach of Kohlâ€™s to more customers"
214,"And by default, that means make some of our value more appealing"
215,So a lot of these technology implementations do that and make it easier for more casual customer to consider Kohlâ€™s and get the kinds of value that typically might have only been seen clearly by our charge customers
216,"So usually growth in non-Kohlâ€™s Charge business is a very good signal for us that weâ€™re on the right track to improve performance, looking forward"
217,And the other piece that I think is important that varied in there
218,"Chuck is that for the first time in quite a long time, we have begun to see new customer acquisitions grow"
219,And that has not been the case for us for quite a long time
220,"And so thatâ€™s another indicator that the offering, both product and marketing that weâ€™re delivering, is more appealing to people who haven't traditionally shopped at Kohl's"
221,"Well, I mean, we've staked out our space, Matt"
222,"I think, we've looked at our business and recognized that our long-term success hinges on our ability to deliver best-in-class omnichannel experience"
223,"So that means recognizing that on the digital side of the business, we have to compete with virtual retailers, like Amazon, as well as general merchandize retailers"
224,", let's say, in our private brands, like Target and Walmart, as well as general merchandize department stores who offer similar categories that we do"
225,But the biggest asset we think we have is our stores
226,"And the fact that weâ€™re non-mall based, 95% of our stores are in strip or freestanding locations, gives us a huge advantage to be an omnichannel retailer in the future"
227,And so everything we're working on is to fundamentally make that happen
228,"And our sense and we're probably sounding very optimistic, because we are, is that this is working"
229,and it's delivering
230,And youâ€™re seeing it in the results
231,And traffic is improving sequentially all year sales are improving sequentially all year
232,"Bruce just updated our guidance by raising the low end, which tells you that we're very confident going into the fourth quarter"
233,So I think our focus is how do we continue on this path to be the best we can from an omnichannel standpoint and so many of our investments are targeted there
234,I mean the store competitive closure strategy or the tactics that will continue in the fourth quarter
235,"And we're probably more optimistic on that just because we now have the third quarter results behind us,"
236,so we can see we actually got a lift
237,"From initiative perspective, I think we covered a lot of the things we're doing in the fourth quarter"
238,"But the trend of the business coming out of the third quarter and now into the fourth quarter, just indicates to us that the things weâ€™re doing are working"
239,"I mean, I can probably provide some of your answer and Bruce can give you any specifics he wants to add"
240,We did talk about national brand mix in call
241,"it grew 300 basis points as a percentage of the total, which means that it grew in the mid single-digits as an increase, which by default means that our proprietary brands were modestly down as a result of that"
242,But it was functionally all because of the edits and pairing down of the brands and categories we offer in the exclusive brand portfolio
243,So our actual private brands performed pretty well
244,It was a nice increase step up in trend
245,"On an active business, yes, Iâ€™d say"
246,mid-teens is a good number to use
247,We have aspiration of it going higher as customers continue to move into that lifestyle
248,"So I think weâ€™re well positioned to take advantage of that, for sure"
249,But third quarter continued the same trend
250,"On a sales basis, it accelerated but as a percentage of the total, yes, Iâ€™d use a mid-teens number"
251,"On Amazon, there is really not anymore color other than to reinforce what I said in the call"
252,We have a really very simple straight forward objective here
253,And that is driving traffic is a number one priority we have as a company
254,"And initiatives that might help us drive traffic and allow customers to consider Kohlâ€™s as a stop instead of somewhere else, weâ€™re going to consider"
255,And we think these are two companies that share a lot of common trades in terms of their pursuit of excellence
256,"And so, it just made a ton of sense for us given the objective we have"
257,"I mean, the two big things are"
258,"home over penetrates always has, you can imagine there were obvious reasons that that happens"
259,"And the second piece of course a little bit connected to the first is national brands over penetrate, as well"
260,"But those two things are tied together right, because home is more highly penetrated than national brands, as well"
261,So national brands more important online and home definitely important online
262,"Again, weâ€™re back to this discussion with the fourth quarter one of the reasons weâ€™re relatively bullish on the fourth quarter beyond the trend of the business coming into the quarter is just that online business has been very strong all year, home business has been very strong all year, national brands have been strong all year"
263,I can do the first part
264,Bruce will answer you on the SG&A
265,"And the speed the market initiative, we continue to make really good progress there"
266,"Without going into all of the details about the individual brands percentage of products receives, which is on speed to market versus not on speed to market, the way I would characterize it"
267,And I think you can watch the performance of two metrics as indicators as to whether or not we're making progress
268,"Number one if speed to market is working then inventory should go down, while sales should outpace inventory"
269,So I think third quarter is a great example of that
270,They came into the quarter with less inventory than last year we came out of the quarter with less inventory than last year
271,"And yes, we had a positive sales increase"
272,So what that says to me is weâ€™re delivering more relevant merchandize more closely to need and overall very-very positive
273,And the obvious metric watches our merchandize margins improve
274,"Though, particularly in our private brands, do we start to get improved performance"
275,and I think all three quarters this year we've stepped up performance with our private brands and
276,a lot of it is due to the speed to market initiative
277,"On the SG&A stuff, I think, Bruce would have that"
278,"Patrick on the competitive store closures, the way -- the only way I would characterize"
279,it is that obviously we have a relatively sophisticated tracking system for this looking at the sales of the stores and trend in and the sales of the stores in the trend out
280,"And there is no question that in the markets in which weâ€™ve targeted competitive store closures, we have lifted sales"
281,"I wouldnâ€™t want to quantify it for you and I wouldnâ€™t want to at all try to project that until like some future performance, because I think thatâ€™s dangerous to do"
282,But there is absolutely no question that sales have lifted in those markets
283,"For sure, when we have opened stores in markets, omni sales are positively affected and when we closed stores in markets"
284,omni sales are negatively impacted
285,I canâ€™t tell you
286,and I donâ€™t think we have the numbers on these specifics stores
287,So I wouldnâ€™t want to go there with you right now
288,But there probably be a point in time down the road where we could give you more information on that
289,But there is absolutely no question that omni sales are positively or negatively impacted based on the scale of the physical environments you have
290,"And so thatâ€™s why -- again, weâ€™re back to this why we feel so strongly about our store base"
291,"Continue to make progress, again without going into all the detail in the various areas inside the business, some are making more than others"
292,As you can imagine some regions or country are more positively impacted by localization than others
293,But I always -- the two metrics that I look at is if localization is working what weâ€™re seeing weâ€™re doing is effective then you should see inventories become more productive
294,I think we would say they have been and
295,you should see merchandize margins improve
