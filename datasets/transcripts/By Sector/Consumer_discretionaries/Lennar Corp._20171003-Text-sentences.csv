0,Good morning and thank you
1,"This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, who you just heard from; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto and others as well"
2,"As always, Iâ€™m going to start with a brief overview"
3,Bruce will deliver further detail
4,And then weâ€™ll go to our Q&A portion where we ask your indulgence that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour that weâ€™ve allotted
5,"So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce very healthy earnings for our third quarter, in spite of the active hurricane season thatâ€™s affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth"
6,And in fact let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity
7,"First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially of course Houston"
8,"And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continued to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath"
9,"Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago"
10,but it was really only just last month and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated
11,"Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida through Georgia and up the eastern seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas"
12,"Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company and this is greatly appreciated"
13,"Additionally with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico and our company through the Lennar foundation is meaningfully contributing there as well"
14,"And then of course just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market"
15,The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all but most impacts those closest to it
16,"And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need"
17,Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element and I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar and Iâ€™m very proud to be able to represent our efforts
18,"Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, weâ€™ve been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year"
19,"Overall, weâ€™ve continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations"
20,"Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher"
21,The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth
22,"And while much of the data collected by the government doesnâ€™t seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford todayâ€™s more expensive homes"
23,"Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving"
24,There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the governmentâ€™s pro business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax release as well
25,The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly while at sometimes even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal
26,We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we moved through the selling season and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases
27,"Additionally, the economic realities of a constraint supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market"
28,"Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market"
29,"And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve"
30,"Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments"
31,"To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before"
32,Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12% and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year
33,"In the third quarter, new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month"
34,"Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over five homes per community per month followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over four homes per community per month"
35,"We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities"
36,"In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase"
37,This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue
38,"Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool"
39,This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently
40,We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margins
41,"Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform which is our lowest sales incentives since 2006."
42,"As youâ€™ve heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model"
43,"Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter which is the lowest in history"
44,"As Iâ€™ve said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time"
45,As Iâ€™m sure you will recall we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year
46,The integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennarâ€™s operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well
47,"With any combination, the hard work begins at closing"
48,"After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved"
49,"The WCI combination and integration is now complete and the results are coming in exactly as expected, as Lennarâ€™s margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised"
50,We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute and Iâ€™d like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community
51,"In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter"
52,"For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss"
53,"Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak"
54,Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time
55,"After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operations is equally difficult"
56,"As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these two hurricanes quite well"
57,We have attended to our associates
58,We have accessed the damage to our communities
59,We have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations
60,"As we have said, our communities sustained only minor damage and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018."
61,"Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well and Bruce will give some additional detail"
62,"With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings"
63,"Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the affect of the two hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we have continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet"
64,We have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating costs down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow
65,"These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of the year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year"
66,"While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future"
67,Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment
68,"As youâ€™ve seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million"
69,"While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business"
70,Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program
71,"As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings"
72,"Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes"
73,"LMC, Lennarâ€™s Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment has also continued to grow and exceed expectations"
74,LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter driven by the sale of two of our merchant build apartment communities
75,"While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, weâ€™ve also significantly grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio"
76,"In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in three communities with the total development cost of $371 million"
77,"As of August 31st, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion"
78,"These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion"
79,Our multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations
80,"Turning to Rialto, Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago, as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance"
81,These direct investments should be winding down over the next two quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses
82,This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment
83,The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base
84,"As we have said before, our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles"
85,"Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity"
86,"On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators"
87,RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1% selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans
88,"Finally, just to mention FivePoint because I always have, as you all know, itâ€"
89,™s now an independent public company
90,"Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch"
91,"As Iâ€™ve said before from Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol FPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked"
92,"In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and weâ€™re feeling very optimistic about our future"
93,"Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery"
94,We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future
95,"In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen"
96,"People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018."
97,"With that, let me turn over to Bruce"
98,"Well, let me start and"
99,Iâ€™m sure that Jon whoâ€™s really been spearheading the dynamic pricing and Rick would also want to join in
100,But dynamic pricing â€
101,“ our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really it helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth
102,"It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine recognizing that as we near completion, itâ€™s time to sell"
103,That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally
104,"And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%"
105,And I feel that thatâ€™s very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing
106,Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels
107,Weâ€™ve seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory
108,Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives
109,And getting people tuned in to properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that
110,"So, Jon, do you want to add to that?"
111,Not just buy something
112,Some of them are under contract and were moving towards a closing and the storm now means theyâ€™ve got to fix something or get their home ready so that they can sell it and ultimately close on their home
113,And of course weâ€™re cutting them some slack in this area
114,"Let me just interrupt there and say what might be a little counterintuitive to the investor group is the power companies; it would seem that after the power is back on, everything normalizes"
115,But the power companies actually have a pretty comprehensive intercompany agreement to go to where the problems are
116,So even a problem like the power in Puerto Rico brings some of the manpower from the power companies locally to other areas and impairs their ability to get back up running here in south Florida
117,So youâ€™re going to continue to see some disruption until many of these storm affected areas are really up running and stabilized
118,"Yes, which we havenâ€™t commented on that yet"
119,but we will with our year-end conference call weâ€™ll give detailed 2018 guidance
120,See you later
121,"Look, first of all, Ivy, in the immediate past I think that weâ€™ve had an unusually large overhang on our stock as it relates to pending storm activity"
122,And I think thatâ€™s been the case now for some time
123,I canâ€™t even tell you how long
124,"But aside from that if you look at our strategy and you look at the way that our company is performing, weâ€™ve been very focused on a growth strategy that targets 7% to 10% rate"
125,But with WCI thatâ€™s been trending a little bit higher
126,We are very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback
127,But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms
128,Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock in cash transaction
129,It ended up being an all cash transaction which was in effect a large stock buyback
130,Itâ€™s fully integrated
131,Itâ€™s well executed
132,And weâ€™re becoming a real cash flow program and machine which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways
133,"And weâ€™re fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital perhaps more importantly in very positive and constructive ways"
134,Weâ€™ve mapped out our strategy for the Street to consider
135,The execution has been flowing in course
136,"And I think that over time remembering that we are less focused on quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month stock performance and more concerned and focused on adherence to a strategy that is designed to maximize return on equity, return on capital over a longer period of time, weâ€™re fully confident that our stock performance will continue to be excellent over the long term"
137,"Yes, so both â€“ as you mentioned, FivePoint weâ€™re there"
138,With regard to multifamily and Rialto we still have I believe a couple of years of maturity and execution to really prepare them for a spin
139,And I for one simply donâ€™t want to sell cheap
140,Iâ€™m about maximizing shareholder value over longer periods of time
141,"And I think both of these engines, both of these machines have the ability to be best-in-class executions and will afford our shareholders strong values as they mature"
142,"LMC is progressing exactly â€“ not exactly, even better than we ever anticipated"
143,"If you look at the composition of our apartment communities, the distribution between the merchant build and the build-to-core programs that we have in place, we just have an excellent program of execution ahead over the next couple of years that will define an extraordinary value for that compendium of assets"
144,"As it relates to Rialto, weâ€™ve had some bumps in the road which weâ€™ve articulated over time"
145,We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striving forward
146,and we have every confidence that weâ€™ll be able to do that also
147,"But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialtoâ€™s RMF execution, those two isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class"
148,They are blue chip and they will ultimately drive shareholder value
149,So I think weâ€™re
150,right on course
151,and I think that we have the management patience to execute well over a longer time horizon
152,The stock market might fluctuate a little bit more on a short-term basis and weâ€™re going to continue to execute our plan
153,"I think the most important thing to focus on is the bandwidth that we have in this company to migrate turbulent waters, to execute our business strategy and to execute across a rather broad platform"
154,and I think weâ€™re
155,right on course
156,We never comment on M&A but we leave all options open
157,And we think that the cash flow program that we have in place really enables us a broad range of opportunities to be able to access â€“ to be able to execute and to be able to perform and I think that youâ€™ll continue to see us balance between all kinds of possibilities and execute on opportunities
158,So weâ€™ll leave it at that
159,Good morning
160,"Bruce is going to jump in and talk a little bit more about the margin effect, but before he gets to that let me just jump in on this notion of fade"
161,I think itâ€™s going to take some time to actually ferret some of this out
162,"But overall long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, youâ€™re more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, thereâ€™s really very little fade in terms of value and pricing"
163,"As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that youâ€™re going to see a shorter term"
164,negative turn into a longer term positive and thatâ€™s traditionally what weâ€™ve seen in storm affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it
165,It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet
166,"And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to repaired and ultimately brought on line, those homes will get repaired"
167,They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade and I donâ€
168,"™t think that that will be the impact to margin, if anything"
169,It will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front
170,"But, Bruce, go ahead"
171,"So if youâ€™ve ever been to a baseball game, youâ€™re begging a baseball metaphor here"
172,Have you ever noticed that people warm up before the game actually starts?
173,Thatâ€™s
174,the inning that I think weâ€™re in
175,"I think this is just getting started and thereâ€™s a big, big range of opportunity in the technology field to refine the homebuilding business that has only started â€“ weâ€™ve only started to prick the surface of some of these areas and we are really invigorated by it both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this"
176,And I would encourage you at some point to â€
177,"“ when youâ€™re down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center which weâ€™ve done on our third floor here"
178,We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business and we think that thereâ€™s a long way to go
179,Your question of course is how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down?
180,And I canâ€™t quantify that right now
181,But I think weâ€™ve just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about
182,Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover advantage?
183,Iâ€™m not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board
184,But itâ€™s not about first-mover advantage
185,"Itâ€™s about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work"
186,Itâ€™s hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement and itâ€™s something that we work on every day
187,"So as youâ€™ve watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, letâ€™s just make a movement"
188,"but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome"
189,So itâ€™s not a first-mover advantage in a traditional sense
190,"Itâ€™s the sooner you start, the more time youâ€™ve put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs"
191,"So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, itâ€™s to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that weâ€™ve been articulating as weâ€™ve gone through the past years"
192,But I donâ€
193,"™t think somebody can come along and just pick up and copy what weâ€™ve done and say, okay,"
194,now weâ€
195,™ve got the answer so we can get the answers right on the test
196,The implementation is the hard part
197,"The infusion of capital into these markets, even those that donâ€™t seem to have been affected that much is a sharpening arm to people who are thinking about buying, moving up, trading"
198,and it just stimulates the economy in the long run
199,Iâ€™ll explain the 50 basis points again
200,The reason for the 50 basis points was both for the 950 deliveries being pushed which took into account the fact that they were higher margin Florida deliveries that were being pushed
201,So the remaining deliveries on an average basis would have a lower gross margin percentage as well as the impact to losing some leverage in field expense
202,So thatâ€™s already embedded in the 50 basis points that I described
203,"We did have a range for the year, Mike"
204,"So we still are ending up with the range that we had for the year, the lower end of that range of the guidance that we gave previously"
205,"No, that was for the fourth quarter"
206,Letâ€™s take one more question
207,I think that we donâ€™t want to give kneejerk guidance
208,"And the bottom line is in the middle of turmoil, it would be easy to try to give something"
209,and then not be able to live up to it
210,I think weâ€™re going to have to let these markets settle a little bit
211,ASP is going to be affected
212,Incentives are going to be affected
213,Construction costs on labor are going to be affected
214,And weâ€™re going to let the market settle a little bit before we give more guidance into 2018.
215,But we feel pretty good about the business overall
216,"When you have a lot of water and wind come through a certain area, you got delays"
217,Thereâ€™s no question about that
218,And what weâ€™re trying to do is manage our business as efficiently and effectively as we can
219,"Jon and I tell the guys all the time, we donâ€™t want a weather report; weâ€™re looking for execution"
220,"So Iâ€™m not here to give you a weather report at this point in time, but thereâ€™s no question we will encounter some delays"
221,Thatâ€™s going to be with regard to getting some materials
222,Pipe is pretty tight right now
223,In addition to that thereâ€™s just been a slowdown on the overall inspections as both the municipalities are focused on other infrastructure things that are more compelling to get up and running
224,Okay
225,"With that, thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to updating you with our fourth quarter conference call"
