Good morning and thank you
This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, who you just heard from; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto and others as well
As always, I’m going to start with a brief overview
Bruce will deliver further detail
And then we’ll go to our Q&A portion where we ask your indulgence that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour that we’ve allotted
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce very healthy earnings for our third quarter, in spite of the active hurricane season that’s affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth
And in fact let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity
First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially of course Houston
And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continued to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath
Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago but it was really only just last month and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated
Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida through Georgia and up the eastern seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas
Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company and this is greatly appreciated
Additionally with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico and our company through the Lennar foundation is meaningfully contributing there as well
And then of course just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market
The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all but most impacts those closest to it
And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need
Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element and I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar and I’m very proud to be able to represent our efforts
Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we’ve been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year
Overall, we’ve continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations
Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher
The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth
And while much of the data collected by the government doesn’t seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today’s more expensive homes
Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving
There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government’s pro business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax release as well
The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly while at sometimes even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal
We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we moved through the selling season and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases
Additionally, the economic realities of a constraint supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market
Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market
And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments
To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before
Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12% and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year
In the third quarter, new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month
Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over five homes per community per month followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over four homes per community per month
We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities
In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase
This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue
Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool
This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently
We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margins
Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform which is our lowest sales incentives since 2006. As you’ve heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model
Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter which is the lowest in history
As I’ve said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time
As I’m sure you will recall we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year
The integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar’s operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well
With any combination, the hard work begins at closing
After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved
The WCI combination and integration is now complete and the results are coming in exactly as expected, as Lennar’s margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised
We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute and I’d like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community
In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter
For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss
Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak
Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time
After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operations is equally difficult
As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these two hurricanes quite well
We have attended to our associates
We have accessed the damage to our communities
We have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations
As we have said, our communities sustained only minor damage and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well and Bruce will give some additional detail
With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings
Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the affect of the two hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we have continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet
We have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating costs down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow
These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of the year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year
While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future
Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment
As you’ve seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million
While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business
Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program
As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings
Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes
LMC, Lennar’s Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment has also continued to grow and exceed expectations
LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter driven by the sale of two of our merchant build apartment communities
While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we’ve also significantly grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio
In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in three communities with the total development cost of $371 million
As of August 31st, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion
These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion
Our multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations
Turning to Rialto, Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago, as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance
These direct investments should be winding down over the next two quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses
This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment
The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base
As we have said before, our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles
Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators
RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1% selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans
Finally, just to mention FivePoint because I always have, as you all know, it’s now an independent public company
Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch
As I’ve said before from Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol FPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked
In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we’re feeling very optimistic about our future
Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery
We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future
In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen
People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. With that, let me turn over to Bruce
Well, let me start and I’m sure that Jon who’s really been spearheading the dynamic pricing and Rick would also want to join in
But dynamic pricing – our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really it helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth
It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine recognizing that as we near completion, it’s time to sell
That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally
And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%
And I feel that that’s very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing
Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels
We’ve seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory
Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives
And getting people tuned in to properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that
So, Jon, do you want to add to that?
Not just buy something
Some of them are under contract and were moving towards a closing and the storm now means they’ve got to fix something or get their home ready so that they can sell it and ultimately close on their home
And of course we’re cutting them some slack in this area
Let me just interrupt there and say what might be a little counterintuitive to the investor group is the power companies; it would seem that after the power is back on, everything normalizes
But the power companies actually have a pretty comprehensive intercompany agreement to go to where the problems are
So even a problem like the power in Puerto Rico brings some of the manpower from the power companies locally to other areas and impairs their ability to get back up running here in south Florida
So you’re going to continue to see some disruption until many of these storm affected areas are really up running and stabilized
Yes, which we haven’t commented on that yet but we will with our year-end conference call we’ll give detailed 2018 guidance
See you later
Look, first of all, Ivy, in the immediate past I think that we’ve had an unusually large overhang on our stock as it relates to pending storm activity
And I think that’s been the case now for some time
I can’t even tell you how long
But aside from that if you look at our strategy and you look at the way that our company is performing, we’ve been very focused on a growth strategy that targets 7% to 10% rate
But with WCI that’s been trending a little bit higher
We are very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback
But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms
Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock in cash transaction
It ended up being an all cash transaction which was in effect a large stock buyback
It’s fully integrated
It’s well executed
And we’re becoming a real cash flow program and machine which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways
And we’re fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital perhaps more importantly in very positive and constructive ways
We’ve mapped out our strategy for the Street to consider
The execution has been flowing in course
And I think that over time remembering that we are less focused on quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month stock performance and more concerned and focused on adherence to a strategy that is designed to maximize return on equity, return on capital over a longer period of time, we’re fully confident that our stock performance will continue to be excellent over the long term
Yes, so both – as you mentioned, FivePoint we’re there
With regard to multifamily and Rialto we still have I believe a couple of years of maturity and execution to really prepare them for a spin
And I for one simply don’t want to sell cheap
I’m about maximizing shareholder value over longer periods of time
And I think both of these engines, both of these machines have the ability to be best-in-class executions and will afford our shareholders strong values as they mature
LMC is progressing exactly – not exactly, even better than we ever anticipated
If you look at the composition of our apartment communities, the distribution between the merchant build and the build-to-core programs that we have in place, we just have an excellent program of execution ahead over the next couple of years that will define an extraordinary value for that compendium of assets
As it relates to Rialto, we’ve had some bumps in the road which we’ve articulated over time
We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striving forward and we have every confidence that we’ll be able to do that also
But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialto’s RMF execution, those two isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class
They are blue chip and they will ultimately drive shareholder value
So I think we’re right on course and I think that we have the management patience to execute well over a longer time horizon
The stock market might fluctuate a little bit more on a short-term basis and we’re going to continue to execute our plan
I think the most important thing to focus on is the bandwidth that we have in this company to migrate turbulent waters, to execute our business strategy and to execute across a rather broad platform and I think we’re right on course
We never comment on M&A but we leave all options open
And we think that the cash flow program that we have in place really enables us a broad range of opportunities to be able to access – to be able to execute and to be able to perform and I think that you’ll continue to see us balance between all kinds of possibilities and execute on opportunities
So we’ll leave it at that
Good morning
Bruce is going to jump in and talk a little bit more about the margin effect, but before he gets to that let me just jump in on this notion of fade
I think it’s going to take some time to actually ferret some of this out
But overall long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you’re more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there’s really very little fade in terms of value and pricing
As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you’re going to see a shorter term negative turn into a longer term positive and that’s traditionally what we’ve seen in storm affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it
It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet
And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to repaired and ultimately brought on line, those homes will get repaired
They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade and I don’t think that that will be the impact to margin, if anything
It will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front
But, Bruce, go ahead
So if you’ve ever been to a baseball game, you’re begging a baseball metaphor here
Have you ever noticed that people warm up before the game actually starts? That’s the inning that I think we’re in
I think this is just getting started and there’s a big, big range of opportunity in the technology field to refine the homebuilding business that has only started – we’ve only started to prick the surface of some of these areas and we are really invigorated by it both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this
And I would encourage you at some point to – when you’re down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center which we’ve done on our third floor here
We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business and we think that there’s a long way to go
Your question of course is how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down? And I can’t quantify that right now
But I think we’ve just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about
Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover advantage? I’m not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board
But it’s not about first-mover advantage
It’s about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work
It’s hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement and it’s something that we work on every day
So as you’ve watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let’s just make a movement but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome
So it’s not a first-mover advantage in a traditional sense
It’s the sooner you start, the more time you’ve put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs
So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it’s to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we’ve been articulating as we’ve gone through the past years
But I don’t think somebody can come along and just pick up and copy what we’ve done and say, okay, now we’ve got the answer so we can get the answers right on the test
The implementation is the hard part
The infusion of capital into these markets, even those that don’t seem to have been affected that much is a sharpening arm to people who are thinking about buying, moving up, trading and it just stimulates the economy in the long run
I’ll explain the 50 basis points again
The reason for the 50 basis points was both for the 950 deliveries being pushed which took into account the fact that they were higher margin Florida deliveries that were being pushed
So the remaining deliveries on an average basis would have a lower gross margin percentage as well as the impact to losing some leverage in field expense
So that’s already embedded in the 50 basis points that I described
We did have a range for the year, Mike
So we still are ending up with the range that we had for the year, the lower end of that range of the guidance that we gave previously
No, that was for the fourth quarter
Let’s take one more question
I think that we don’t want to give kneejerk guidance
And the bottom line is in the middle of turmoil, it would be easy to try to give something and then not be able to live up to it
I think we’re going to have to let these markets settle a little bit
ASP is going to be affected
Incentives are going to be affected
Construction costs on labor are going to be affected
And we’re going to let the market settle a little bit before we give more guidance into 2018. But we feel pretty good about the business overall
When you have a lot of water and wind come through a certain area, you got delays
There’s no question about that
And what we’re trying to do is manage our business as efficiently and effectively as we can
Jon and I tell the guys all the time, we don’t want a weather report; we’re looking for execution
So I’m not here to give you a weather report at this point in time, but there’s no question we will encounter some delays
That’s going to be with regard to getting some materials
Pipe is pretty tight right now
In addition to that there’s just been a slowdown on the overall inspections as both the municipalities are focused on other infrastructure things that are more compelling to get up and running
Okay
With that, thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to updating you with our fourth quarter conference call
