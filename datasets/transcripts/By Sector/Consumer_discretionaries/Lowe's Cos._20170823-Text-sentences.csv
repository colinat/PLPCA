48,"First, as weâ€™ve discussed, we were pleased with the acceleration of our comp growth in the quarter, the result of our amplified marketing messages, compelling offers and integrated omni-channel experience; the incremental investments weâ€™ve made in these areas are paying off and weâ€™ll continue those investments into the second half of 2017."
49,"Second, as Robert and Rick shared, weâ€™ve also made the decision to reinvest in incremental customer-facing hours in the second half"
50,We believe this will allow us to more fully capitalize on our strong traffic trends and ensure weâ€™re delivering an excellent customer experience
51,"Finally, weâ€™re seeing incremental pressure from our private label credit card program due to increase in program costs driven by higher losses, as well as casualty claims due to increased workersâ€™ compensation costs"
52,"We still expect the total sales increase of approximately 5%, driven by a number of factors"
53,"First, weâ€™re forecasting comp sales increase of approximately 3.5%; second, the RONA acquisition drives about 2% growth; also, we plan to open 25 stores, which represent approximately 1% sales growth"
54,"Keep in mind, total sales growth will be reduced by roughly 1.5% related to the comparison of 52 weeks in 2017 versus 53 weeks in 2016."
55,"However, on a GAAP basis, we are anticipating an operating margin increase of 80 to 100 basis points as a result of the investments and incremental expense pressures that are just described"
56,"Remember, a full year of RONA results versus roughly seven months last year will pressure operating margin by an estimated 15 to 20 basis points for 2017."
57,Effective tax rate is expected to be 36.9% this year
58,"For the year, on a GAAP basis, we are now expecting earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.30."
59,"Please refer to Page 13 and our supplemental reference slide for summary of adjustments, as you compare 2017 to 2016."
60,"We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.9 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion"
61,This results in estimated free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion for 2017.
62,Our guidance does assume approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2017.
63,"Regina, weâ€™re now ready for questions"
64,Question-and-Answer Session
65,"Peter, this is Marshall"
66,We are maintaining our targets that we previously communicated back in December
67,"Obviously, this year, wonâ€™t hit those targets"
68,"But, productivity is still alive and well and is actually helping us offset the incremental investments we are making this year"
69,We know weâ€™ve got more runway to go as we move forward
70,"So, the investments we are making from staffing, again weâ€™re leaning into it to take advantage of the increased traffic, leaning into optimized promotions and knowing that weâ€™ve got opportunities to utilize price optimization tools, continuing value improvement efforts and continuing to evaluate promotional effectiveness"
71,Thatâ€™s a longer term
72,"Weâ€™ve got other productivity majors for optimizing labor, leveraging fixed costs, reducing indirect spend, lower depreciation and enhancing profitability in Canada"
73,Yes
74,"As we updated in our guidance, weâ€™re expecting about 10 more basis points of incremental gross margin pressure, driven by some of the actions that weâ€™re taking, leaning into the amplified marketing that weâ€™re doing thatâ€™s helping drive the traffic"
75,"So, thatâ€™s putting pressure on gross margin line for the year"
76,"So, it actually improved about 20 basis points of drag to about 30 basis points, to get above that from the year standpoint"
77,"While we leveraged retail operating hours, we did have the incremental advertising spend and a couple of other items I alluded to,"
78,"some of the pressure weâ€™ve seen in the back half with casualty claims, workersâ€™ claims and costs there"
79,We saw little bit of that in the second quarter
80,"And also, itâ€™s been competitive in marketplace from client standpoint, put pressure on delivering fleet"
81,"But, the bigger drivers are back half or leaning into the marketing message, reinvest in that and to try to capture more of the sales that weâ€™re seeing coming through to offset some of those back half pressures"
82,"So, we came in with a plan, I think roughly 35 stores"
83,"We since have gone through and scrubbed and evaluated certain locations, and some of them we decided not to open at this time or will defer until later point in time"
84,"Matt, this is Marshall"
85,"At this point in time, weâ€™re comfortable with reconfirming the guidance, as we lean into the back half of some of these incremental investments"
86,"Again, we have better line of sight to not only productivity efforts that we are driving this year, but in 2018 and 2019 above and beyond that and also looking at what weâ€™re leveraging from 2017 into 2018 and 2019 from the capability builds, how we are leveraging pro, continuing to take a look at our office staffing complement, trying to match labor to track traffic that weâ€™re seeing and fixed costs, indirect spend as mentioned earlier"
87,"So, again, at this time, weâ€™re comfortable with these longer term targets and productivity at this point in time"
88,"If we have better line of sight to revise, weâ€™ll provide that in upcoming call"
89,"Basically for the year, we spoke to 15 to 20 basis points impact on operating margin advantage for Canada"
90,Itâ€™s roughly about 20 basis points for the quarter
91,"And then, share repurchase, again, weâ€™ll target $3.5 billion this year, in 2017."
