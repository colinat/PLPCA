62,"Christie, we're now ready for questions"
63,Question-and-Answer Session
64,I'll take the first part
65,We were actually pleased with what we're seeing from in-store and online traffic in August
66,"And as Rick mentioned, we were working on investing in increasing our associate hours for customer-facing in areas where we need it the most to ultimately help us drive better conversion"
67,"So as that played out in the quarter, we began to see that pickup in September, but a little bit soft in August"
68,We think that our guidance for the quarter for the year is appropriate and balanced as we look to invest in running the business and continue to invest in our ongoing capabilities
69,We are confident in our ability to drive traffic in Q4.
70,We do expect some benefit from the hurricanes as we move into Q4 and into 2018.
71,"But one of the things again, we've been optimizing our selling hours in the stores"
72,[Indiscernible]
73,We like where we are today
74,"But again, recognize Q4, we have tough comparisons to last year"
75,"So, as we mentioned, weather can be kind of wildcard in the fourth quarter"
76,So just keep those in mind as we head into Q4.
77,"As far as where we are quarter-to-date, we're just slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter"
78,"So ultimately, the gross impact obviously hurt our mix because it is below average company rate on gross margin"
79,So that certain had an impact
80,"We did have incremental SG&A expenses, but all told, net-net, while it was slightly positive, it wasn't a driver to our earnings for the quarter"
81,"Eric, this is Marshall"
82,"Actually, yes and yes, we want both, sales productivity and SG&A productivity cost out"
83,So those will continue to be focus area
84,"so you think about some of the investments we're making from the omni-channel capabilities, we want those to be sales drivers and think about processes within the stores from this customer experience to services, again, trying to eliminate employee customer pain points"
85,But we've got good line of sight into actions one that we took this year
86,"Rick highlighted a couple of those with indirect spend, moving the needle on how much we centralized indirect spend, along with some of the changes we've made to the payroll staff model"
87,", the leadership changes that we made earlier in the year, along with things that we're doing from supply chain efforts to drive better productivity, reduce burden for the distribution center and stores"
88,"So, all of that wrapped up into amount of investments we've made in 2017 to be able to drive flat operating margin on an adjusted basis for 2017 and knowing that we've got future opportunity to keep getting after from a productivity standpoint and moving to 2018 and 2019 and beyond"
