0,"Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone"
1,"We're quite proud of the results we've reported this morning, and I think it's a tribute to what we've discussed many times before in terms of our focus on margin, profitability and the very hard work of the men and women that have brought incredible operational efficiencies to this organization"
2,"As you know, our cash flows rose in the quarter, and on a hold-adjusted basis, EBITDA would have been up 10%"
3,"We've guided you, when we talked about the second quarter, to lower gaming revenue, higher non-gaming revenue, and margins that would be up slightly"
4,"We met that guidance and in fact, did better than we expected in terms of profitability and margin as a result of our initiatives"
5,Our margins grew 82 basis points to just over 31% and that was despite the fact that we were down almost 5 percentage points year-over-year in table games hold
6,"On a hold-adjusted basis, as I said cash flows would have been up about 10%, and our margins would have been up over 200 basis points on The Strip alone"
7,CityCenter had another outstanding quarter
8,"Its revenues and cash flows grew 10% and 36% respectively, and our focus on margin has driven our operational efficiencies in every single department in which this company operates"
9,We have achieved this despite the fact that we're investing in the future
10,"As you know, we're dramatically transforming MGM's Monte Carlo property into Park MGM, that's been disruptive and will remain so throughout this year, and despite that, we're very comfortable where we see the Street in terms of earnings for the year"
11,"Regionally, our properties continued to do dramatically outperform their competitors"
12,MGM Detroit had an all-time record in terms of revenue and EBITDA
13,"National Harbor is already the market leader in Maryland and of course Borgata continues to perform at an outstanding rate, and that is a tribute to Tom Ballance, retiring today from Borgata and moving into corporate, and the rest of the great team at Borgata"
14,"Obviously, the results in Macau as a market have been impressive, we are anxiously awaiting the opening of Cotai that will help us dramatically"
15,That resort opens in a couple of months
16,Grant will talk more about it
17,"But suffice to say that it would help not only drive more business to our MGM property on the Peninsula, but we believe it will be very dynamic and it's very successful in Cotai"
18,"We've had a very strong year this year in Las Vegas, both in the first and in the second quarter"
19,"We just had another record at McCarran Airport in June, and the company has focused on maximizing the opportunities that are in front of us"
20,And that means maximizing the revenue per occupied room in all of our resorts
21,That is the reason why our margins were up more than we expected
22,"It's also the reason why RevPAR was below what our guidance was, as we consciously moved some occupancy away from higher ADR, but lower revenue per total occupied room into different channels, which resulted as you can see in higher profitability and higher margin, we expect that going forward"
23,We see a very good third quarter underway
24,"We have many challenges in the quarter because of a huge citywide convention quarter last year, and we held very well as we indicated in the third quarter of 2016, but despite that because we have an epic fight coming up in a couple of weeks and because we have good business on the books, we expect to see profitability increase again and margins also increase again"
25,"We believe that going forward, that the second half of the year will remain strong and that we will continue to be able to improve our profitability and margins, and in fact we are raising our margin guidance from what we have said earlier because we see more opportunities to increase margin going forward, already the industry-leading margin and certainly here in Las Vegas"
26,"This could be the second biggest fight of all time and it will certainly drive millions of people to watch Las Vegas, watch T-Mobile, and watch Mayweather and McGregor"
27,We intend to maximize every $0.01 of profitability opportunity there
28,and we're working very hard to accomplish that
29,I think we will be very successful
30,"We've a lot to look forward to in the second half of the year, not only the opening of Cotai in the fourth quarter but the improvements that we're taking to all of our operations, which we see as accelerating our margin"
31,"We're running this company for cash flow and if that has not been clear in the past, certainly was in this quarter and we will continue to do so going forward because we believe that's the best way to drive value to our shareholders"
32,and we intend to continue to be competitive in the marketplace when we find opportunities on the horizon
33,and I think the opportunity currently on the horizon is Japan where I would say that we are one of the leaders in terms of contenders in that marketplace
34,I have to say that I'm proud of what we've done
35,But I believe that our best days are ahead of us and what we see today is more confidence in our business than we've seen in the last ten years
36,"So with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator, so we get to your questions"
37,Question-and-Answer Session
38,"Sure Joe, it's almost exclusively business decisions that we're making here"
39,It does not reflect at all the health of the market and certainly does not reflect our perspective of the market in the second half of the year
40,"When we started PGP, we were focused on many of the non-hotel areas where we could drive margin profitability, not only in terms of table games margins and overall casino margins, but in our non-gaming areas in terms of driving margin there"
41,The hotel divisions of many of these resorts including ours have been run more independently and have been focused on driving RevPAR
42,We know that that's not the right approach in a casino hotel environment
43,That's not how you drive profitability
44,No one here in this room that I'm aware of is bonused on RevPAR
45,We're bonused on profits
46,We made a decision when we moved from PGP to continuous improvement to dig in more on our hotel yielding and do it more holistically
47,We actually started that in the beginning of the year
48,"It had a minimal impact on the first quarter, because we had such a strong convention calendar in the first quarter"
49,"It had more of an impact in terms of RevPAR in the second quarter, but we drove more profitability throughout the resorts in the second quarter"
50,That's why revenue per occupied room in the second quarter was actually up over 5%
51,That's the important metric
52,"In terms of looking forward, we feel very strongly, and we know this business pretty well, the way to drive increased margin and increased profitability is the yield total resort from a standpoint of driving revenue into the resort, and that will have a dampening impact on RevPAR, and that's okay because we're trying to drive more profits"
53,"The only macro point I would say in the quarter was a little bit of a weakness, a little bit of softness in the early part of June"
54,"It was literally like a two-week period of time, and it bounced back right at the end of the month"
55,"But really that had minimal impact, and also we probably underestimated the impact of the disruption at Monte Carlo a little bit, but these are just fringe things, it's not the overall point"
56,"I think the overall point is, on RevPAR as we're talking about it, a 1% difference in RevPAR"
57,"So in other words, instead of if we did 2.2% instead of 1.2% for our portfolio"
58,A 1% delta is only $2 million of profit
59,A 1% increase in our margin just on The Strip is $14 million
60,"We made a decision which we'll continue to make to focus on profitability and margin, and that really was the total story in terms of RevPAR in the second quarter, and the reason why we want people to be more focused on this in the third and fourth quarters"
61,"We're going to have a good third quarter, very strong despite the big city-wides that we saw last year and a 10% increase in RevPAR that we had last year"
62,"And we're going to have that because of a Mayweather-McGregor fight, a GGG-Canelo fight and some good convention business"
63,"But more importantly, I think we're going to be able to drive margins in the third quarter more than we had predicted when we began the year"
64,"Grant, could you tackle that?"
65,"So just adjust just for Monte Carlo, RevPAR would have been 1.8%"
66,No
67,"No, we had predicted what we have in terms of resort fees in that number and in our prior guidance"
68,Really the difference is Monte Carlo being a little tougher than we thought and a very short period of time in June
69,But I really want to emphasize the fact that we're moving away in Micah's team and our hotel yield team away from focusing on maximizing RevPAR
70,"We've all known about this, both the sell-side, the buy-side, us at management, that that's not really the best way of running our business"
71,"But we didn't have the tools frankly, Felicia, earlier in our process until this year in terms of analytics, in terms of intelligence to yield these resorts in a more holistic way"
72,And that's a manifestation of continuous improvement
73,"We have people doing this now that we didn't have before, hired from other companies"
74,"And it will have a impact on total revenue per occupied room in a very positive way, we think"
75,"On the business side, Felicia, we see convention partners changing somewhat their convention practices"
76,"For example, some of the larger companies are consolidating some conventions"
77,They might have five in a given year of a certain size and they're consolidating them down to three or four
78,"That has some kind of volatility around some of the convention markets around the United States, and I think, a little bit to a lesser extent here in Las Vegas, but we've seen that trend occurring"
79,"The reality to that is they're actually driving a lot more delegates per convention obviously, as they consolidate the number of conventions"
80,"So, we see bigger spikes in convention attendance rather than what we had seen before"
81,"As an example, we literally last week just finished Microsoft"
82,"They were in here, it was amazing for better part of a week"
83,"That's a convention as you know, we didn't have last July, and it was highly successful for us"
84,"So, I think the only â€“"
85,"and I'll turn it over to others if they see anything differently, but the only thing we see a little bit differently is how companies are handling their convention business"
86,Every other segment â€“
87,"and by the way, we're still going to be up in conventions, and we're still doing extremely well"
88,"And Las Vegas, I think is the beneficiary of this, because we're a better value destination"
89,"Every other segment is up: leisure for us, will drive you more people for our own channels, which is more profitable to us, our FIT business, the casino was very strong, and that's why total revenue per occupied room was up nicely in the quarter"
90,I'll turn it over to Corey for that
91,"Yeah, I'd just add to that part, Corey"
92,"Obviously, we are well aware of the CRM softwares that are out there, salesforce"
93,"com being one that Caesars is using, and other companies have different techniques"
94,We have our own CRM
95,It's going to evolve and one of the things that has been a benefit of the Borgata acquisition has been â€
96,“ they've had a very strong CRM process in place at Borgata
97,"And we're taking that learning, and Tom Ballance, who is now in corporate with us, is leading the team with Anton Nikodemus and a variety of our best leaders here, including Marcus Glover, who is going to be running Borgata to make it a company-wide decision on improving analytics, and artificial intelligences and CRM"
98,"But that's exactly what Corey is referring to by changing the channels on the non-gaming side this year, and being able to do more process, marketing on the gaming side"
99,"We've been able to increase our revenue per occupied room, which is why you see a really good slot handle, and you see good table volume, it would have been more evident if we had just held normally, but even with lower hold, it benefited us"
100,So thank you
101,It's a good way to kind of step back and look at what we're trying to accomplish here
102,One is obviously to drive free cash flow and I will get into that more
103,"But certainly, we're accelerating our free cash flow generation in our operations this year versus last"
104,and we think next year significantly more
105,But adding to free cash flow comes the other levers that we have
106,One of the major levers that we have is MGP
107,We were really clear when we brought MGP public
108,"a couple Aprils ago that National Harbor which has a ROFO, it would be an asset that we would like to transact with, with MGP"
109,We also said that we'd like to have a few quarters under National Harbor's belt before we entered into those negotiations
110,"Well, we have a few quarters under our belt right now, so I would think that it would be logical to assume that a transaction would be more in the near term than the long term between MGM and MGP"
111,"That, if done properly, and we expect it would if we do it, would have a profoundly positive impact on MGM Resorts in terms of its liquidity and its cash and squarely fits with the overall arching belief that we need to return cash to our shareholders"
112,"MGP is out on the prowl on a variety of other transactions, some of which will not involve MGM, but others very likely could"
113,"And recall that we're opening up Springfield, Massachusetts,"
114,"next year, I think in September or August and that obviously is a candidate for MGP as well"
115,The other lever that we have is clearly through asset sales
116,There has been a significant level of interest on The Strip right now
117,There is really strong chatter around the Fontainebleau being sold with a hotel flag that will be put on it
118,"We're not involved, to be clear"
119,"But that would be a good sign for the market, if people are willing to invest a lot of money to try to bring that property to life"
120,And we own assets as well
121,We own Circus Circus
122,We own the Mandarin at CityCenter and several other assets that we always look to find out what we should do in terms of our best interests
123,"In terms of other levers that we have, clearly CityCenter itself with another record quarter is generating a significant amount of cash"
124,"We will continue to return that cash to its shareholders, Infinity World and MGM"
125,"And of course, once we open up in Cotai, MGM China should turn into a significant free cash flow generator beginning next year"
126,"So, the levers that we have in front of us that we're constantly trying to maximize are number one, free cash because our CapEx is going to roll over and be very minimal going forward; two, asset sales or other ways of monetizing assets; three, dividends from our ventures"
127,That's a good question that hasn't been asked of us before
128,"But yes, I feel like if there is â€"
129,“ I got to talk to our board about this â€
130,"“ but if there is a significant one-time event that would generate a tremendous amount of cash to MGM Resorts, that would impact our decision making versus free cash flow that is steadily and rapidly growing"
131,"And yes, we've been very clear on capital allocation and shareholder"
132,returns
133,"We started with dividends, quarterly dividends"
134,We expect that we'll be able to increase our quarterly dividend over time
135,But that share repurchase also will be part of our discussion at the board level
136,"And if we have a significant windfall, which I think we will, one or two of them, over the next couple years, we'd be more immediate in our transferring that windfall to shareholders than rapidly growing free cash flow"
137,Thank you
138,"Yeah, and I think maybe, I don't want to cut you off, Dan, but I think that that's exactly right"
139,"Because our convention mix is growing and becoming more profitable to us and because we see a strong convention calendar in 2018 and 2019, and because we're expanding our convention facilities right now at Aria and at MGM, and you weave that together with the expansion already at Mandalay that sets up a much stronger foundation for us to look at the rest of our rooms"
140,"From the rest of our rooms' perspective, we're becoming more intelligent about how we can shift leisure into transient"
141,And that requires software that we're deploying
142,"It requires a different philosophy which we're also deploying, but it also is as a result of the fact that we're more confident in our overall occupancies than before"
143,And that's
144,"I guess the point that should be always made is that all of us out here, our competitors and ourselves, run these resorts at mid 90s occupancy"
145,That's why RevPARs is so misleading
146,It's not about occupying the buildings
147,"It's about occupying the buildings in a way that will generate the most profit to the resorts, not just to the hotel department of the resorts"
148,The combination of this and the loyalty CRM marketing that's going to have an impact
149,â€“ increasing impact on the casino side is going to provide a revenue and profit growth that we did not anticipate when we started this about a year ago
150,"I guess three years, 2.5 half years is the earliest, but I would say three years"
151,And I guess the point I'd make
152,I love this town
153,"We don't have as many rumors in Las Vegas as Macau, but we do hold our own that it would be more hotel centric than anything else"
154,"And obviously, up near a expanding and upgraded convention center, that would be very positive for the town and positive for Northern properties like Mirage and Circus Circus, of course"
155,"And I think that knowing what we know about our own portfolio, the level of interest we're getting on assets that are not already owned by MGP is very high"
156,"And we're a transactional company, and so I do expect that there will be opportunities, like we did with Crystals opportunistically to sell that asset at very attractive cap rate"
157,", I think there'll be other opportunities to monetize without changing the overall trajectory of what we're trying to accomplish here"
158,"Yeah, I mean that's obviously"
159,yes
160,"One, I think we should start talking about Aria as part of our family more"
161,I mean people look at Aria
162,is like a separate than the rest of our portfolio
163,But we run Aria as we run any other property in terms of moving a business around and having customers make their decision
164,So that I think Cathy's point is a good one
165,But we anticipated a tough comp
166,That's why we had said in the second quarter that our gaming revenue is like going to down
167,We didn't anticipate 500 basis-point decrease in hold year-over-year
168,"But we're going to have a tremendous amount of gaming volume coming in, in August"
169,"If people don't understand the impact on fights and this is not just a fight but a spectacle, just kind of watch TV"
170,We've had a lot of people that said we're coming in August that did not come in June or July
171,They're coming in August and that will help
172,"So I think that our feeling about gaming volumes here in town in terms of our own and our competitors is quite solid, particularly on the Far East side"
173,"And the standpoint of looking at what drivers that are events, and to have two fights in one quarter is something we've never had before"
174,So we're hopeful that that has a gaming impact that we could be proud of
175,I'll start and then anyone can jump in
176,"One is our convention business looks like it will be at least as good, if it not better, in '18 versus '17."
177,"That's the base that I was referring to, and it's the manifestation of some conventions that I was alluding to before that have shifted from '17 into '18 as some of the big companies have consolidated some of their convention business"
178,That's going to actually help us in '18.
179,That's the first point
180,Second point is we'll have the benefit of the expansions of our conference facilities at Aria and emerging at MGM
181,That certainly helps captures much of the incremental business as we can
182,"Thirdly, we're converting Monte Carlo, which has been at our lower end of our RevPAR, our ADR spectrum into Park MGM and NoMad, which will be at the upper end of our ADR spectrum in our portfolio"
183,"That will have a very, I think, nice impact not only on that resort but the neighborhood"
184,and we own the neighborhood
185,"And so driving higher ADRs in New York, New York, driving better mix throughout that campus will be effective"
186,"The third, I would not ignore the fact that we're having our first professional sports team start in a couple months"
187,"The Golden Knights will be playing later this year throughout early '18, which sets up for very strong sports calendars that we expect to have in '18 and beyond, increasing sporting events to Las Vegas, whether it's more college, and/or more pros will have a big impact on the market"
188,And we should do better than most on that
189,The airlines are â€
190,"“ they're talking positively about '18 in terms of coming into McCarran, and the convention center itself, the Las Vegas Convention Center is also talking about a better year"
191,So those are some of the macros that I know
192,I don't if you have any others?
193,"That was a good point, Corey"
194,"Anything else, Dan, on that?"
195,50 basis points to 100 basis points
196,"And I think we always will, Dan"
197,"I mean I think the point that we've made to folks is that when you own 42,000 hotel rooms here and you're driving this business for cash flow and to try to increase revenues going forward, you're going to,"
198,"within the CapEx contours that we've stated, which we would reaffirm, we're able to reposition properties within a couple year period of time as we straddle years in terms of CapEx to dramatically increase profitability"
199,"It does have an impact in the near term at the property itself, like it is at Monte Carlo, but we have the benefit of having 10 resorts out here"
200,"And so we feel like we can drive revenue, margin growth, profitability even when one property is undergoing this type of transformation"
201,And it won't be the last one we do
202,"If we are successful in converting Monte Carlo to Park MGM as we expect and get the kind of returns on investment that are going to be outsized relative to other investments that we can make, we'll look at another property to tackle in the out years"
203,"And so I think that's part of portfolio management in terms of trying to drive revenue, profitability, and long-term growth while you are focusing on free cash"
204,There are a bunch in there
205,We can all jump in in different ones
206,"One is, we usually don't borrow conventions, we steal and keep them"
207,And I think it unlikely that we'll lose anything back to the Moscone Center
208,"In fact, we haven't so far"
209,"So, we'll see"
210,"But once people get here and they see the value proposition, and they see the delegation attendance up 20%, 30% versus the other host city, they tend to only, generally do not leave, but we'll see"
211,"The 19% reflects the fact CON/AGG is not here next year, so actually that we would say would be a very good outcome for our company"
212,and it's not the ceiling to it
213,", it's just what our projection is at this point in time because of what we see on the books and the fact, we're expanding our convention facilities"
214,You want to take the RevPAR one Corey or Dan?
215,"And so the ADR, I mean, the RevPAR connection between RevPAR, what Robin was asking and profitability, you want to explain that?"
216,"I mean, it's the margin on the incremental non-gaming room"
217,is higher because of our channel shift
218,"And also these customers, not only gaming, but these customers spend a lot more money in entertainment, whether it's in our nightlife or food and beverage, our shows in general"
219,"They're becoming more sports oriented which is a focus of ours, event driven, park theater, so it's not only improving the gaming side without having â€"
220,"“ our comp levels haven't changed by the way, Robin, on that point, but it's improving our non-gaming non-hotel revenue"
221,It depends on who won
222,"I'll start, maybe Grant, if in case Grant is asleep"
223,We have not made our
224,Okay
225,We've not made our submission yet in terms of tables
226,That is something you do towards the end of the process
227,"We have focused a lot and you can see it on in our investor deck on the nongaming components to COTAI, which we believe are transformational in that market"
228,"It's very unique, particularly on the entertainment side, which we are noted for"
229,All that plays into the government's decision around table allocations
230,and we're going to do the best we can on that and based on what we get
231,", Grant will decide how to move tables around"
232,"Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
233,"Thanks very much, Jim"
234,You're welcome
235,So I just like to wrap up and say thank you for joining us
236,I'm proud of the effort in the second quarter in terms of executing on our plan
237,"We're excited about the current quarter, having the second biggest fight of all time, it's a kind of fun"
238,"I'm excited about how in shape Mayweather is, I saw him in his gym"
239,"a couple of nights ago, and I'm excited about what we have happening in the second half of the year"
240,"We're very clear on our direction here at the company in terms of maximizing our free cash flow, our capital expenditures are defined and declining and are unchanged from what we discussed with our community several times"
241,We believe that results in significant growth in free cash and we intend to return that free cash to our shareholders
242,We have multiple levers ahead of us and some of them are imminent and that will enhance the overall return on capital to our shareholders as it relates to transactions that we talked about today
243,National Harbor couldn't be doing better from our perspective and is perfectly positioned to ultimately be owned by MGP
244,"CityCenter is performing at an outstanding level, and also, is well-positioned to return more capital to its owners and perhaps provide more asset opportunities in terms of disposition"
245,"Macau is right around the corner in terms of the opening of COTAI and the impact of having such a beautiful property that we think will be very successful, the impact that will have to the MGM China shareholders"
246,"We will continue to build the company for the long-term but continue to reward our shareholders throughout this journey, and we will do so in the ways that have articulated"
247,And I think that that will increase the value of the enterprise significantly over time
248,"And with that, I'd like say thank you very much for joining us today"
249,We're excited about the back half of the year and into 2018 and beyond
250,"And as always, we're ready to take any of your questions"
251,"So, please give us a call"
