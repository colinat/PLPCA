0,"Thank you, Steve"
1,I appreciate the opportunity to join the call today and update everyone on the state of our U.S
2,business
3,"continues to demonstrate solid growth, and I'm proud of our system and the progress we're making"
4,"As I look ahead to 2018, I'm excited about our pipeline of ideas and the growth potential they offer"
5,"For us, the key will be to execute at a really high level across a number of initiatives"
6,and we're investing a lot of time and effort right now to get that right
7,Let me provide more insight into our Q3 performance and then I'll talk about how we're preparing for 2018.
8,"During Q3, we grew comp sales 4.1%, resulting in a comp sales gap of 440 basis points versus the QSR sandwich competitors"
9,"Importantly, our comp sales growth was supported by positive guest count growth"
10,This is our third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth and second consecutive quarter of positive comp guest count growth
11,"For the past three quarters, we have posted a favorable comp gap versus QSR"
12,We're particularly pleased with this performance because we had to overcome the headwinds of a sluggish overall IEO market that currently offers limited traffic growth
13,Our success can be attributed to several factors
14,"First, we offered compelling consistent value programs across a number of tactics that clearly resonated with our customers"
15,We continued our $1 any size soft drinks program and supplemented it with the return of McPick 2 for $5 that offered some exciting food deals
16,We're also starting to get real traction with the targeted mobile offers via our app that are tailored to customers' unique buying preferences
17,"Second, we've been able to capitalize on this increased traffic into our restaurants with menu news that drove customers to trade up to premium higher-margin products"
18,"In Q2, we launched our Signature Crafted sandwich line available either in beef or chicken, with three flavor combinations, pico guacamole, sweet barbecue bacon and maple bacon Dijon"
19,"In August, we rotated in a new Sriracha flavor that gave the sandwich Crafted line an extra kick"
20,"In September, we also reintroduced McCafÃ© to the U.S"
21,"This meant a new, more modern look for the McCafÃ© brand and new choices, including the reintroduction of our McCafÃ© Espresso line after a significant equipment upgrade across our system"
22,The McCafÃ©
23,"Espresso products perform very well, reaffirming our systems confidence that McCafÃ© can be a significant growth platform for us in the future"
24,As we've seen with both Signature Crafted and
25,"McCafÃ©, when we improve the taste and quality of our products to meet customers' rising expectations, they reward us with more business"
26,"Finally, we're seeing encouraging customer response to our velocity accelerators including delivery, digital and Experience of the Future"
27,"Through our partnership with UberEATS, we now offer delivery in 3,700 restaurants and we're on track to reach 5,000 restaurants by year-end"
28,"We're learning a lot about delivery and seeing particular success in dense urban metros with high penetration of younger customers, like New York, Boston, Miami and Los Angeles"
29,I truly believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on this opportunity
30,We're also continuing to roll out mobile order and pay with a new curbside check-in option
31,I'm really excited about the potential of curbside to evaluate the convenience of McDonald's to a whole new level for our customers
32,"We now have mobile order and pay in over 6,000 restaurants"
33,"And we expect to reach all 14,000 restaurants by the end of the year"
34,"And last, we're making good progress with our Experience of the Future projects and we're seeing comp sales lifts consistent with our targets"
35,We currently have Experience of the Future deployed in 13% of restaurants and that number will increase significantly over the next couple of years
36,As the pace of activity in the U.S
37,"accelerates, it's critical that our restaurants are properly staffed and trained to execute at a high level"
38,"Our McOpCo and operator organizations are investing in labor right now to train for initiatives like hot off the grill, hospitality, curbside, delivery"
39,This will have a temporary impact on margins for the next six to 12 months as we work through our deployment calendar
40,"We've seen this before in other markets like Canada, Australia and the UK when they've launched similarly aggressive plans and we feel quite confident about our ability to manage through this short-term situation"
41,"At the same time, we're also ramping up our internal project management capabilities to prepare, deploy and maximize each initiative"
42,We've created dedicated Project Management Offices at both the national and regional levels to ensure we anticipate resource bottlenecks and flex organizational capacity as needed
43,We aim to prove that size and speed do not need to be antithetical to one another
44,"Two years ago, Steve declared that McDonald's needed to run better restaurants and nowhere"
45,was that more evident than in the U.S
46,market
47,"As Steve mentioned, we recently visited a number of U.S"
48,"cities, including East St"
49,"Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Salt Lake, Houston and it was really a proud moment for our owner operators to showcase their progress"
50,"On almost every dimension, the U.S"
51,is running better restaurants and that's showing up in the business results
52,"At the same time, that pride and confidence in our performance is helping to energize the system to pursue an even more aggressive growth agenda"
53,Almost 100% of U.S
54,"operators have now signed commitment letters in support of a holistic multi-year growth strategy that will update the entire system to EOTF, make important equipment upgrades to deliver better food and ensure we remain competitive on value"
55,We're excited about what's to come in the U.S
56,", and I look forward to updating you periodically on our progress"
57,"Now, back to you, Mike"
58,Question-and-Answer Session
59,"Yeah, hi, Karen"
60,"So certainly, what you're seeing in the trading results that we just posted, you're seeing primarily labor related to the training that I was talking about"
61,"There is some commodity inflation, but the biggest drag that we're facing right now is related to the labor investments that are being made"
62,"In terms of going forward, I think one of the pieces that remains to be seen for us is just what does the long-term labor inflation look like in the U.S"
63,"And so, we have seen with roughly 5% unemployment that labor inflation has been ticking up nationally"
64,"In addition, there's local legislation that's going on as well, where minimum wage laws are increasing"
65,"So that long-term could be a headwind, which just would require a faster growth rate than what we've historically seen"
66,"But I think right now, it's unclear where that goes"
67,"I think for us, certainly the investments that we're make right now on training"
68,", those are one-time investments that would abate in the next six to 12 months"
69,"And I think the longer term, is we just need to keep our eye on labor inflation across the U.S"
70,Sure
71,"Well, one of the things that we have said to our franchisees in the U.S"
72,"is we don't have to win on value, but we can't lose on value"
73,And that means we have to be competitive with our investments against a value program
74,"And I think also it's no surprise that over the last, call it, three or four years since we rolled off Dollar Menu"
75,", we weren't as competitive as we needed to be on value"
76,And so what you're going to see from us next year
77,is us being really fully competitive with our near-in competitors with a value program there
78,"It's been written about and I don't think it's any surprise that certainly our value program is going to be focused on $1, $2 and $3 price points for an everyday-value piece of it"
79,And then there will also be deals that will pulse in and out throughout the year as a result of that
80,"When you talk about the investment that is being asked of Owner/Operators, one of the things that we talked about is that this plan has to be looked at holistically"
81,And so while there is an investment that's being made on the value side
82,", there are also some significant efficiencies that are being captured on the other side, around particularly marketing and efficiencies that we're getting there, efficiencies that we're getting at the restaurant level"
83,"And so when you look at all of it on a blended basis, we think that this is a balanced plan"
84,"And I think, most importantly, the fact that our Owner/Operators were at almost 100% signing up for is probably the best testament that they felt comfortable with the value investments being offset by some of the other things in the P&L"
85,"Well, I think we're excited about coffee, in part, because it's a huge category"
86,It's a $30 billion business in the U.S
87,and it's growing mid-to-high-single digits as a category
88,So we're excited about the category
89,It's high margin and we're under-penetrated there
90,"So as we built the plan, it was rally about us getting after an opportunity where we think our McCafÃ© brand has a lot of relevance"
91,We're not going get into the specifics of by product line item
92,", how did those compare versus the average comp, but"
93,"I would just say that, certainly, we saw the benefit in Q3 of really nice growth on our McCafÃ© business"
94,"And as we look out over the next few years, we're expecting to use McCafÃ"
95,© as really a platform for us to get additional growth
96,So we're excited about that
97,We think we have a good opportunity to get after it
98,It's really been a question of focus for us
99,We haven't consistently focused on this in the past
100,"And going forward, it's going be a key area for us"
101,"Yes, well, so I'd say what we typically see is as we're deploying, whether it's EOTF, some of the menu news, et cetera, we typically do see a slight uptick in service times, call it, on the order of five seconds or so"
102,"And then, certainly as the crew in restaurants get more experience in whatever the initiative is, we expect to claw most, if not all, of that back over time"
103,"I think it's, for us, when you look at the Experience of the Future, one of the things that makes it difficult to really do the from-to on that is because as we bring in Experience of the Future with curbside, you start introducing all sorts of new ways for the customer to interact with the brand"
104,"And so maybe in the past, they would just go through the drive-thru because, frankly, they didn't see going into the restaurant as a great experience"
105,"Now, they want to go into the restaurants because it's an updated modernized experience where you can get table service there"
106,"And so it's really, I think, what we're seeing with Experience of the Future is that customers are choosing new ways to interact with the brand that makes it difficult for us to compare"
107,"I think the more relevant metric really, for us, is we look at customer satisfaction"
108,We look at customer satisfaction prior to EOTF and after EOTF
109,And what we're seeing there are significant improvements on the order of three to five points improvements in overall customer satisfaction
110,"So for us, that gives us reassurance that they are enjoying the initiatives that we're deploying with EOTF"
111,and they're having a better experience
112,Yes
113,"I think, as you know, with McPick, certainly this year, there was a heavy local element to it"
114,"So we had different regions pursuing different McPick strategies, both the price points that they would hit, but, frankly, also the items that they would be selling for"
115,"And so it's difficult to do the comparison that you're talking about because it's not just what item at what price point, but it's also"
116,where was the starting price point for that
117,"In general, I think the point that you're making, though, is an accurate one, which is we think that we still had an opportunity to get more competitive on value"
118,"Again, we're not trying to win on value, but we can't lose on value"
119,And so I think what you're going be seeing from us going forward is really for us consistently to stay competitive on value
120,"And I think the other thing, as I mentioned earlier in the call, is more of that investment now going forward is going be done and driven at the national level than at the local level, which I think plays to our strength from a marketing communications standpoint where we can really drive that message"
121,"Well, so one, I think being relatively new to McDonald's, I'd say one of the things that has really been a highlight for me is getting to know our U.S"
122,Owner/Operators
123,And I'd tell you they're â€
124,“ it's a very impressive group in terms of what they're able to drive
125,And so you're seeing that in the results here
126,"Our point of view, and certainly all my discussions with the Owner/Operators in the U.S"
127,has been I would love for every single one of them who's currently in the system today to remain in the system
128,"And so there is no, from our vantage point, concerted effort to try to change the franchisee base or have it look different"
129,"But that said, we do have expectations around performance"
130,"And, as you said, as we said earlier, running better restaurants is the foundation"
131,And we were not consistently running the type of restaurants in the U.S
132,that we were expecting to
133,And so step one has been we have really level set what the standard is for performance in the U.S
134,"At the same time, we've outlined a pretty, what we think is exciting and ambitious growth plan, but it is one that's going to require investment"
135,"And so as you put those two together, as you put together a performance expectation along with an investment expectation, we are seeing some Owner/Operators are deciding now is a good time to exit the system"
136,"And I think for us, while we certainly are sorry to see folks go, we would rather have that conversation where we're all operating from just a very transparent set of expectations"
137,"So I think over the next couple of years, we're probably going to continue to see some evolution of this, but by and large"
138,I think the U.S
139,franchise system as you see it today is going be the same one that we're going to be talking about in a few years
140,"And I think just to maybe give a concrete example, I mean, as we laid out 2018, we have a number of initiatives that are going to be hitting the market in 2018."
141,"One of the biggest ones, the first one that's going to be coming out is, we call it, hot off the grill"
142,It's sometimes referred to as fresh beef
143,"But right now, we're actually bringing on a number of regions onto this platform as we convert over our supply chain"
144,"When we bring on hot off the grill or fresh beef into a market, we actually have a six week training curriculum that the entire restaurant goes through"
145,"And it's a very intensive training curriculum that they have to go to, actually starting with the operator"
146,"The operator first goes through training, and then we literally take every single one of those crew members with both an offsite and then an in-store training experience"
147,"All the time that's spent on training for hot off the grill implementation, all of that counts against your labor and none of it is revenue-producing"
148,But it's the sort of thing that we think is required to really make sure that when we do rollout hot off the grill that we execute it at a really high standard
149,"So that's just one example, but we have a number of other initiatives that have the similar type of training and preparation curriculum that's going with it that obviously puts a short-term burden on what needs to be done at the restaurant"
150,Yes
151,"And so, I think just to build on that, it is a relatively flat market, but I think what we're seeing is that when you're really sharp with your proposition that you're offering the customer, the food that you're offering, the value that you're doing with the experience, when you've really got a compelling proposition to put forth, you can gain significant share"
152,"And so, certainly, the comp gap that we've been seeing, our comp gap has been widening over the last three quarters"
153,And I'm very excited about what we've got in the pipeline going forward
154,"I think as I said at the opening of my comments, the absolute key for us is going to be to execute"
155,"But I think if we execute and, again, we stay really sharp with the proposition that we're offering customers, I don't see any reason why we couldn't sustain that performance, but it's on us to demonstrate it"
156,"Well, so I'd say we are still in the early innings, in honor of the World Series, in the early innings of digital, but we're seeing, I think, a really nice start to it"
157,So we've had almost 30 million downloads
158,"I would say we're roughly 9 million active users, meaning who are in it on a monthly basis that we're seeing there"
159,"And we're seeing strong offer momentum, which is really currently the primary benefit that we're delivering through the app"
160,"As we're rolling out now mobile order and pay, the power is going"
161,be that to then bring together the offer with the ability to do mobile order and pay
162,"Right now, what we're doing mostly in our restaurants with the roll out of mobile order and pay is"
163,we're really at this point focused on getting the operations right
164,"So getting, for example, the crew to understand when a curbside order comes up, how do they take that order, how do they go out and bring the food to the customer"
165,"So, right now, I'd say we're spending a lot of time on mobile order and pay"
166,"Yes, as we're deploying it, but really make sure we've got the operational muscle there, because what will happen then in 2018 is we're going to flip the marketing switch on it and start to drive really much more increased usage"
167,"But, certainly, we've learned from some of the other activity out there"
168,"We want to make sure that we're ready when we do flip on the marketing switch that we're ready to handle the business with it, but still early innings"
169,We do think that it's a significant opportunity for us and we would expect in the future it becomes a more significant part of the comp
