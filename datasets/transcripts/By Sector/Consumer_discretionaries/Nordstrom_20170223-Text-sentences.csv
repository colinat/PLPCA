1,Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model
2,"Throughout the year, we took aggressive actions to prioritize our resources and optimize inventory turns"
3,These efforts have translated into stabilized retail operating margins over the past three quarters combined
4,"We also generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the year, well surpassing our five-year historical average of $1.2 billion when excluding the sale of our credit card portfolio"
5,This reflected working capital improvements largely driven by a 2.5% reduction in inventory
6,"We also delivered free cash flow of $550 million for the year, which also benefited from a 20% reduction in CapEx from last year"
7,"Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, reflecting continued momentum in our inventory and expense execution"
8,"As Blake mentioned, our gross profit expansion of over 100 basis points had a meaningful positive impact on earnings"
9,"This reflects our strategies around product differentiation, which includes our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands and private label"
10,"We believe that over the long run, these strategies support a sustainable regular-price selling business which mitigates the impact of promotional activity in the marketplace"
11,"We are encouraged that even through this current environment, we achieved record sales of $14.5 billion for the year"
12,"As we evolve with customers' changing expectations, we've made investments to fuel multiple growth areas"
13,"Starting with our expansion into Canada, our five full-line stores, including two which opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 million in 2016."
14,"As we previously shared, we believe this market represents a $1 billion opportunity consisting of six full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores"
15,"Second, our total online business reached over $3 billion, growing roughly 30% on an annualized basis since 2010."
16,"Third, our off-price business reached $4.5 billion, and continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining around 6 million in 2016."
17,"And finally, we had a strong customer response to our expanded loyalty program with 3.7 million customers joining through our non-tender offer"
18,"We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of over 55% from last year"
19,"Looking forward, I'd like to spend some time discussing the evolution of our business model"
20,"As we evolve with changing customer expectations, our business has shifted from a four-wall model to one that supports multiple channels"
21,This reflected significant investments to fuel growth over the past five years in both e-commerce and new markets
22,E-commerce now represents nearly one-quarter of our business compared to 8% in 2010.
23,"While we improved profitability in our core business during this time, this accelerated shift to e-commerce has impacted our overall profitability"
24,This dynamic requires us to make fundamental changes in the way we operate
25,"In 2016, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around technology, supply chain, and marketing capabilities"
26,"Over the past five years, spending in these areas grew by 20% on average"
27,"In 2016, we were able to bend that trajectory, cutting the growth in half"
28,This is just the beginning of our progress
29,"As we head into 2017 and beyond, we will continue our efforts to reshape our business model to support long-term profitable growth"
30,The other element impacting our near-term profitability is our investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack
31,"com and HauteLook, Canada, and Trunk Club"
32,We are beginning to realize benefits from these investments
33,"In 2016, they collectively contributed $1.2 billion to our top-line"
34,"Going forward, we expect improved operating performance as they begin to scale"
35,"In addition, 2017 includes pre-opening costs of roughly $30 million related to our Manhattan flagship store"
36,Now I'd like to discuss our outlook
37,"Starting with the capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next five years"
38,"This is approximately 4% of sales, lower than the five-year historical average of 5%, due to moderating store investments"
39,"With technology and supply chain as a key enabler of delivering customer experiences, roughly 40% of our plan is allocated towards modernizing our tech platform, delivering digital and mobile enhancements, and expanding our fulfillment network"
40,"Also, as we shift to a cloud-based platform, the nature of our tech spending is transitioning from a build to a rent model"
41,"To get a holistic perspective on technology, we plan to incur in total a cash spend of roughly $540 million in 2017, or 3.5% of sales"
42,"While this is generally consistent with our run-rate over the past couple of years, our goal is to continually increase our productivity to support accelerated delivery of customer-facing features"
43,"In 2016, we were able to roll-out features three to four times faster versus a couple years ago with further opportunity for improvement"
44,"Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 financial outlook"
45,"We expect earnings per diluted share of $2.75 to $3.00, which incorporates total sales growth of 3% to 4% and flat comp sales"
46,This assumes a continuation of negative trends in our full-line stores offset by outsized online growth
47,Our outlook incorporates relatively stable gross margins while taking into account the negative mix impact from Rack's growth
48,"As we head into 2017, we are in a clean inventory position with plans to maintain inventory growth in-line with sales trends"
49,"Additionally, our focus on product differentiation, which includes limited distribution brands and our private label, supports our ongoing efforts to strengthen our regular-price selling business"
50,"From an SG&A rate perspective, our outlook includes continued technology and fulfillment investments supporting multi-channel growth in addition to incremental costs related to Manhattan"
51,Please also refer to our slides for further assumptions regarding our outlook
52,"We're pleased with our progress in prioritizing resources, improving our productivity, and increasing our speed of execution"
53,"As we position our organization for future success, we still have work to do as we realign our resources and capabilities to better serve new and existing customers, consistent with their evolving expectation of the Nordstrom brand"
54,"One more thing; as this is my last quarterly earnings call with Nordstrom, I'd like to thank both the research and investment community for their support and curiosity for our business"
55,"We have always strived to provide a differentiated experience for our customers, which also means evolving our business"
56,The underlying value to both customers and shareholders is the brand that has been built by our customers and supported by company leadership
57,"As customers' expectations continue to evolve, I'm very confident that the leadership and strategy will continue to elevate the Nordstrom brand"
58,Thank you
59,"Now, I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A"
60,"Thanks, Matt"
61,"Well, Matt, let me take the first part of your question"
62,and that's the pace of sales over the year
63,"While we don't give quarterly guidance, clearly, last year in the first quarter was pretty disappointing and that was a period of time when a lot of us change expectations for the year"
64,So I would expect going up against softer numbers at the beginning of the year might be a little bit helpful
65,"But generally speaking, there's no other material change other than that the Anniversary Sale will go back to its normal cadence between Q2 and Q3."
66,"As far as the retail EBIT being down, I think that's a reflection of the soft business we continue to see in our full-line stores that's causing contraction there"
67,"Interestingly enough, in 2017, we're starting to see the profitability of the online business cross over to a higher margin than the store base business, and as that continues to scale, we expect to see improvement"
68,"In addition to that, there's the investments that continue to keep a little pressure on that"
69,"In terms of the impact of any other reduced sales, most of that comp sales reduction has been coming from the full-line stores, and clearly with the commission-based model, we tend to see some positive leverage that comes from that, and I think in addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to look for ways to readjust our operating model to make it more efficient"
70,"Sure, Bob"
71,Sure
72,"Sure, Kimberly"
73,The first part of your question on where we are with the margins
74,", I mentioned a few minutes ago that we're definitely seeing those two lines crossing"
75,"The margins in the e-commerce business are starting to surpass the margins in the store business, and that, to your point, has been about scale"
76,"The challenge with the whole model has been having an accelerating business that has a high variable growth component and a decelerating business that has a high fixed cost component, which both work against you"
77,"I think we've made great progress in figuring out how to be more efficient on the e-commerce side, and we're starting to see that"
78,"And as Jamie mentioned, we're making some good progress on the store side, which leads us to the second part of your question, and that is when you see stabilization?"
79,"And it's tough to answer that until you reach equilibrium, and I don't think we've reached equilibrium in terms of where store sales and e-commerce sales start to level out"
80,"And so until we reach that, I think you're going to be experiencing some of this"
81,"Now fortunately, that's just a portion of our model"
82,"We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth"
83,"So as we continue to make those adjustments going forward and the investments we've made, we continue to believe that all those collectively will put us in a position that we can grow earnings"
84,"Sure, Kim"
85,"Thanks, Omar"
86,"You're welcome, Ed"
87,"Tracy, I would just add one thing to Blake's comments"
88,"is that, keep in mind, we've grown the online portion of that business to almost 20%"
89,It's roughly 20% of our off-price business now
90,We don't believe there's anybody else out there in that space that has that kind of penetration
91,online and off-price
92,"So I think when you look at the combined businesses, which has been averaging 4% to 5% growth, I think we're right up there in terms of taking market share"
93,Yeah
94,"Well, this is Mike"
95,"In terms of what's driving that, I mean clearly â€"
96,“ I'll start with the HauteLook and Nordstromrack
97,com â€“ that business over the last several years
98,we've seen some great growth that was really accelerated when we started to integrate it with the Rack stores and we started taking returns in the stores
99,and we started to bring those two brands together
100,"That business has moved from being an operating loss, and it's moving into 2017 slightly beyond break-"
101,even where we're starting to make some operating profit there
102,So we're making very good progress in that area
103,"In terms of Trunk Club, we're a little bit disappointed in our sales pace there"
104,Our earnings were better than planned for 2016 as we've made some adjustments there
105,"So I would say, in general, those businesses are roughly operating as expected"
106,Canada â€
107,"“ I think, generally speaking, sales â€“"
108,"or there's plus or minuses by stores, but it's generally operating as expected"
109,So what you're seeing in the improvement is not so much that we're being surprised or things are outperforming what we thought but that they're starting to scale up to where they need to be and will continue to improve over time
110,You're welcome
111,"Thanks, Paul"
112,"Well, Paul, I'll take those"
113,"First as far as the credit EBIT, there's two components that are driving that growth"
114,"One was that in 2016, there were some non-cash amortization due to the sale of those credit receivables"
115,"And without getting into the complexity of accounting, there are certain assets we needed to recognize when we sold, and those got amortized over a relatively short period of time"
116,We don't have that level of amortization in 2017.
117,So that's one piece
118,"The second piece is now that we're less capital constrained and we have a great partner in TD Bank, we're able to do more things to grow that portfolio, and so what you're starting to see is some benefit of us changing that operating model and having more capital available to grow that business"
119,"And so we would expect not only in 2017, but going forward, to see continued growth there"
120,"In terms of the loyalty program, you may recall we launched that non-tender program back in May"
121,It's been really successful
122,"It definitely taught us that there's a lot of folks out there that would like to have a relationship with us, but don't want another credit card in their wallet, and I think that was really important to extend our relationship with our customers"
123,"Generally speaking, loyalty customers spend three to four times more than non-loyalty customers"
124,That is definitely true on the tender side
125,"I think in the non-tender, we still need to learn more about that, but I think as we go forward some of the more significant things that we're going to be able to do is we need to integrate those two models on one platform"
126,That will allow us to continue to offer more seamless experience and also continue to see some of those customers who are on the non-tender gain greater benefit moving to tender
127,So we're excited about that
128,"We're less than a year into it, and I think our plan is to continue to try new things to test to see how customers respond and to certainly further improve the experience for those customers"
129,"Erinn, this is Mike"
130,I take the first part
131,"In terms of the Neiman event, no, I don't think there was anything that was measurable from that"
132,"As far as the Geevy's role, I'll ask Erik to comment on that"
