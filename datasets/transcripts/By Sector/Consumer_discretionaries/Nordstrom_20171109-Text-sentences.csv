0,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our call"
1,"In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, Iâ€™ll share some key initiatives that weâ€™re focusing on for the remainder of the year"
2,"For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67."
3,"We estimate these earnings were reduced by roughly $0.04 from hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey which affected our stores in Puerto Rico, South East Florida and Huston"
4,The damage in Puerto Rico was particularly extensive requiring us to close the store as we continue our repair efforts
5,Weâ€™re grateful to our teams in each of these communities who have extended themselves to help our employees and customers
6,We reported total sales growth of 2% and a comp decrease of 0.9%
7,Lost sales from the hurricanes accounted for approximately $20 million or 60 basis points
8,"When adjusting for this impact, our overall sales performance was generally in line with our expectations"

10,"In our Nordstrom brand, total sales decreased 1.2% and comps decreased 1.9%"
11,Sales in our full-line stores remained consistent with current trends
12,"As we expected, Nordstrom"

14,"When we combine July and August to adjust for this timing impact, Nordstrom"
15,com grew at a mid-teens rate
16,"In our Nordstrom Rack brand, total sales increased 5.5% and comps increased 0.8%, which reflected a step down from recent trends"
17,"In hindsight, our sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive"
18,"As a result, we found ourselves over-inventoried without the fluidity necessary to chase the business"
19,"This impacted our ability to provide newness, which led to softer results in the third quarter"
20,"We have made significant adjustments to our receipt plans to bring our inventories in line, and believe weâ€™re well- positioned for the fourth quarter in this regard"
21,"We recognize the opportunity to improve our top-line results, and are committed to providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise, and the best value possible"
22,Our Nordstrom Rack business remains a highly productive model and is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year
23,Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is as important as ever
24,"Weâ€™re continually testing and learning from new concepts to deliver experiences that improve speed, convenience, and personalization for Nordstrom customers"
25,"This is core to our strategy of providing a differentiated selection of the best products, coupled with a high level of service and experience"
26,"Our most recent example is Nordstrom Local, a test retail concept thatâ€™s focused on services"
27,"Centrally located in West Hollywood, Nordstrom Local gives customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders, and more"
28,"In the first four weeks since opening, weâ€™ve had thousands of customer interactions and are applying the learnings to innovate further"
29,"Ultimately, our goal is to drive increased customer engagement and market share"
30,"Another way weâ€™re engaging with customers on their terms is our Reserve Online and Try In-Store service, which we recently expanded to more than 50 stores across the country"
31,Our customers appreciate its speed and convenience
32,"It frees up their time, and if they choose to do additional shopping in our store, this results in a material lift in their spend"
33,Weâ€™re also connecting the digital and in-store experience with our Style Boards
34,This digital selling tool leverages the expertise of our salespeople and enables customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones
35,"Providing newness is an important aspect of our approach with the customer, and weâ€™re encouraged by our recent collaborations with emerging brands"
36,Our Pop-In Shops give customers access to highly sought-after brands like Warby Parker and Goop
37,Our recent partnership with Everlane has been our most successful Pop-
38,In concept to date
39,Our partnerships with fashion influencers are another way weâ€™re creating inspiration and discovery for customers
40,"We collaborated with the popular fashion blog, Something Navy, to launch an exclusive capsule collection with our in-house Treasure & Bond brand"
41,"It was our largest brand launch ever, generating $2 million in demand for the first day"
42,We made additional progress in growing limited distribution products and our private label brands continue to outperform the Company average
43,We view our stores as a competitive asset and have invested in the markets in which we serve customers
44,Weâ€™ve strengthened our presence in Southern California with the relocation of two full-line stores to Century City and University Towne Center
45,Both openings well exceeded our plans
46,"Also this fall, we had 11 new Rack openings and one relocation in markets that include Los Angeles, Manhattan, and Seattle"
47,"In Canada, we opened the sixth and final of our announced full-line stores with our new store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto"
48,We look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack to our Canadian customers starting next spring in Calgary and Toronto
49,"As we head into the fourth quarter, weâ€™re focused on making Nordstrom a convenient place for customers to do their holiday shopping"
50,We have a number of initiatives in place
51,Weâ€™ve invested in key categories and brands that resonate most with our customers
52,This includes expanding our online selection and fulfillment capacity to support the peak volumes that we expect during the holidays
53,"To make shopping faster and easier, we offer in our full-line stores"
54,Buy Online Pick up In-store with an option for curbside services
55,"Also, in several markets, we have available Reserve Online and Try In-Store and same-day delivery services"
56,"Next month, weâ€™ll offer 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets, including Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, and San Diego"
57,"During this holiday period, we believe the strength of our digital capabilities along with our local market assets, our people, product, and place represent a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers"
58,"Iâ€™ll now turn it over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our third quarter performance and outlook for the year"
59,"Hi, Ed, this is Blake"
60,I suppose itâ€™s very appropriate to look it like -- in that manner holistically
61,"Internally, we look at the opportunities we have to improve the execution, and thatâ€™s in my comments I talked about the inventory opportunities we have"
62,"Itâ€™s just in any retail business, itâ€™s critical obviously to have the best merchandise and good values"
63,Itâ€™s particularly true in an off-price
64,And having plans that were now in hindsight too aggressive caused our teams to have to pull back a little bit
65,"And so, we werenâ€™t in the market as aggressively as we would like to have been to ensure that we have the right freshness and flow and again corresponding values"
66,We think that culminated a little bit in that downward trend that we saw in the third quarter
67,We are very pleased as we start the fourth quarter that we are in line
68,We think we are well-positioned to serve the customer through this holiday time period
69,"But to answer your question, we think itâ€™s those execution opportunities reside primarily with us and we are anxious to try to turn that around here in the fourth quarter"
70,"Bob, this is Blake"
71,I think itâ€™s important to note that we did not change our standards on how we view Credit with our customers
72,"Our team is really executing well, both within the Credit division and obviously in those areas that touch the customers, we execute and service the customer"
73,"Weâ€™re now two years into a partnership with TD, and that partnership is exceeding our expectations, and I think thatâ€™s reflected in our those results as well"
74,"So, overall, itâ€™s not a change in the standards"
75,Itâ€™s
76,"the customer and our folks really getting behind this program, the loyalty program and what it has to offer in terms of value for our customer and itâ€™s a meaningful part of our results"
77,"Jamie, I think the question was more"
78,"if malls maybe had some opportunities, were there some opportunities partnering with some mall owners for some changes in our rentsâ€¦ [Multiple Speakers]"
79,I donâ€™t know if Pete want to take that merchandise?
80,Itâ€™s Blake
81,"I think weâ€™ve talked about this over time longer, from a full-price point of view"
82,"But, we are newer in terms of our digital business ramping up and an off-price point of view"
83,"But, we look at it as a total off-price business"
84,"And so, separating bricks and mortar, stores and digital, those numbers are getting more and more blurred"
85,"And so, we just want to make sure that we are offering the experience in a manner where the customer wants to shop"
86,And the Nordstromrack
87,com and HauteLook business last year did $700 million
88,I mentioned a while back that itâ€™s the fastest growing business we have in the history of our Company going to a $1 billion
89,"So, itâ€™s a meaningful part of the business"
90,"Overall, our total off-price business is $5 billion"
91,"And so, where that ends up going, thatâ€™s up to the customer"
92,"And so, we look at combined and at this point, itâ€™s"
93,a healthy business
94,and we see lots of opportunities
95,and we are encouraged by it
96,It really gets down to do you have the best stuff
97,and do you have the best price
98,"And the fact that we saw a downturn a little bit, indicates obviously the customer wasnâ€™t as enamored with some of our choices and our execution"
99,We are not saying that there was a lack of merchandise opportunities out there
100,"What weâ€™re saying is that we got overcommitted to the sales plans, or to the sales results that we had that it didnâ€™t enable us to be as fluid in the market as we would like to be to chase the business a little bit"
101,"So, itâ€™s a very fragile balance of having the right flow, having the right balance, a couple of great values"
102,"And so, we really view that as our opportunity in the marketplace, some of our competitors are showing consistent results and the vendor partnership work with merchandise, but we just couldnâ€™t get aggressive with some of those opportunities because we had fully committed earlier in the year"
103,And so we made some pretty aggressive changes with that planning to place in a position today where we are in line
104,and we think we have a good plan for the fourth quarter
105,"And I think it will be very important, we come back next quarter, how are those results and where the various initiatives we had to improve execution, did it resonate with the customer"
106,"I am sorry, I forgot that"
107,"So, our average unit retail has been very consistent over time"
108,We did see units come down slightly and thatâ€™s reflected in the sales numbers
109,Let me start with trends at Nordstrom
110,Our trends are actually consistent and have been in the mid double digits all year
111,and we are very encouraged with our trends there
112,"Month-to-month, the timing between shipped sales and returns that come from that can drive the timing of those sales"
113,"So, as you know, we had a very, very successful Anniversary sale online"
114,And the returns we get from those sales show up the next month and the month after that
115,"So, we removing those timing issues, our trends at Nordstrom"
116,con are very consistent and we are encouraged about that
117,"Shipping options, that is a place that we think we can absolutely win with the customer"
118,"Again, itâ€™s leveraging our assets"
119,We have a lot of different ways for the customer to engage with us and a lot of different ways of connecting the merchandise the customer wants with how they want to receive it
120,"So, be it in a store, be at their home, be at the discovery portion being digital or in a physical environment"
121,"So, you will continue to see us offer more options for the customers"
122,"Because we think thatâ€™s part -- itâ€™s not just getting merchandise to the customer faster, itâ€™s giving the customer control of how they want it while also offering as much selection as possible for the timeframe that they want to get the merchandise"
123,"Then, about metrics, do you want to take that Anne?"
124,"Okay, Kimberley"
125,Yes
126,We started the year with the inventory and sales plan that was a couple of hundred basis points higher than actual
127,And we should be striving for the opposite of that
128,We should always maintain a couple of 100 basis points to allow us to have the flexibility to be able to respond to the business in a more timely manner
129,"And so, I think that was probably the biggest driver of opportunity"
130,but there is a lots of things that we think there are opportunities in our execution
131,"From afar, itâ€™s relatively simple business"
132,"To execute though at this level of $5 billion and as productive as it is, there is a lot of nuances to it"
133,"And so our team has been working hard this last year, none of us our satisfied with these results"
134,"But, there is a sense of optimism, encouragement about the things"
135,theyâ€™ve been working on and how that positions us better to be able to respond going forward to the customer
136,"And so, we believe we can get back on the fourth quarter hopefully to the first half trend; thatâ€™s what weâ€™re focused on"
137,"But, we need to show improvement and the last quarter"
138,certainly was a reflection of the customers indicating that we had some opportunities
