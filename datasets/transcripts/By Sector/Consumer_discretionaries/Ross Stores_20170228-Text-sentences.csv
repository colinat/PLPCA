0,Let's start with our fourth quarter results
1,Our 4% comparable stores sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket
2,"As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13.6%"
3,"Cost of goods sold improved by 110 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by 65 basis points of lower distribution expenses mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter"
4,"Merchandise margin improved by 15 basis points while buying and occupancy costs were lower by 40 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively"
5,These improvements were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in freight costs
6,"Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased approximately 20 basis points due mainly to higher wages"
7,Turning to our stock buyback program
8,"During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $170 million, which completed our previous two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program"
9,"For the year, we repurchased a total of 11.6 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million"
10,Let's turn now to our guidance for 2017.
11,"Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are forecast to be $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016."
12,Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week in 2017.
13,And $0.03 in a lower tax rate related to our adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard
14,The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2017 include the following
15,"Total sales for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 are forecast to grow 6% to 7%"
16,"Comparable store sales on a 52-week basis ending January 27, 2018 are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in 2016."
17,We plan to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations
18,"As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores"
19,"If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2017 to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.1%"
20,This EBIT margin range assumes merchandise margin for 2017 will be relatively flat on top of strong growth over the past several years
21,Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 15 basis points from the 53rd week
22,Net interest expense is estimated to be $13 million
23,Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%
24,We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 386 million
25,Capital expenditures in 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million
26,"And depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $400 million, up from $377 million in 2016."
27,Let's move now to our first quarter guidance
28,"For the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2017, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%"
29,Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $0.76 to $0.79.
30,Included in this guidance is an estimated $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate related to the aforementioned adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard
31,Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following
32,Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%
33,We expect to open 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter
34,First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4%
35,The forecasted decline in EBIT is mainly due to higher wage and freight costs
36,"In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3.5 million"
37,"Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 36% to 37%, resulting from the previously mentioned accounting change"
38,"And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 390 million"
39,"Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments"
40,"Sure, Kimberly"
41,"On inventory, I think at the end of the year, it's timing"
42,"As you know, we've reduced inventory by over 40% over the last number of years"
43,I think our perspective is at this point that we'd expect stable inventories going forward
44,"There's not additional room for improvement in that strategy or process, though"
45,"I think as we look forward to 2017, we'd expect our in-store inventory levels to be relatively flat year-over-year"
46,"In terms of tax refunds, it's been our practice not to comment on inter-quarter trends"
47,"Sure, Omar"
48,"As we said in our comments, the planning assumption going into the year that they'd be relatively flat, and that's very simply based on anniversarying many years of strong merchandise margin gains as well as what we believe to be an ongoing challenging and promotional retail environment"
49,"Sure, Laura"
50,"Obviously, for us, direct imports comprise a very small portion of our overall business"
51,I'd say it's still too early to speculate on what specific tax policies will actually get enacted
52,But we'll continue to watch it closely
53,"For us, volatility has historically been a good thing for our price"
54,Sure
55,So we said in the commentary that EBIT is planned down to 50 basis points to 70 basis points
56,"For us, if sales perform in line with the 1% to 2% comp, we would lose some leverage on fixed cost"
57,"In addition, we expect wages to be greater headwind in the first half of the year than the back half as we raised wages in the middle of 2016."
58,And then further we expect freight cost to be a headwind in 2017 as we've seen higher carrier rates
59,"In terms of the full year guidance, stripping out the 53rd week and the impact of the accounting change, we're guiding up 3% to 7% on a 1% to 2% comp"
60,And that's very consistent with how we've guided previous years
61,"With the 53rd week included, it shows EBIT margin relatively flat, and then without the 53rd week, it's down slightly"
62,"Sure, Matthew"
63,"So for SG&A in 2016, the costs were up about 15 basis points"
64,Obviously that was slightly above our 3% leverage point
65,"That said, we were obviously pleased with our overall operating margin expansion"
66,"Our guidance for 2017 projects SG&A leverage at about the 3% leverage point, which is consistent with our historical levels"
67,"Yeah, I mean, I would answer generally to say we have a long history of delivering excess cash to shareholders"
68,"And we've done that in a planned and deliberate fashion, so anytime we look at the deployment of cash, we're looking at it over kind of a longer period"
69,But that process is at the same time of maintaining a very strong balance sheet
70,So I would not expect that to change going forward
71,And the significant increases in our dividend and share buyback programs announced today reflect that commitment
72,Thank you
73,On â€“ go ahead
74,"I'll start with the regional performance, Paul"
75,"As we mentioned, the Midwest and the Southeast were strongest"
76,The Midwest obviously has been very strong region for us as the best performing category the last three years or so
77,Southeast likely benefited from favorable weather
78,"I'd call out other major markets, California was in line"
79,Texas performed below the chain average in Q4.
80,"For us, beyond the possible impact of the oil industry, we believe there were other factors that impacted the region including the stronger dollar as well as negative weather during the quarter"
81,"In general, in packaway, we see it as a sales driver, not a margin driver"
82,So that's the way I think about it
83,"On CapEx, so we're guiding it about $400 million"
84,That's higher than 2016 which was the lowest level since 2011.
85,So that was lower than normal
86,"In terms of the breakout of the $400 million, about 30% is new stores, 30% is for store refreshes and maintenance capital, 15% for supply chain investments, and 25% for, call it, technology and other G&A capital"
87,"In terms of the components of sales, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 4% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket"
88,The higher basket was driven by higher units per transaction with AUR down slightly compared to last year
89,We can hear you
90,"Mike, I think historically weather has had a more meaningful impact on performance during the first quarter than the timing of Easter, which is what we've seen in the past"
91,"So, Lindsay, last year, we took our wages across the board in the company up to $10 an hour based on tenure"
92,Obviously it includes mandated minimum wages and our upcoming guidance takes into consideration the mandates that we're aware of today
93,Not at this point
