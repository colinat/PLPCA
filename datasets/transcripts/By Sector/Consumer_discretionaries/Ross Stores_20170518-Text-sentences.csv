1,Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic as well as an increase in the size of the average basket
2,"While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last yearâ€™s 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations"
3,Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter
4,Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points respectively
5,These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses
6,"Selling, general, and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages"
7,Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters
8,"During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million"
9,"We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year, under the new two-year $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year"
10,Letâ€™s turn now to our second quarter guidance
11,"For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017 we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year"
12,Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions: total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%
13,"We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations"
14,"Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4% reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs"
15,"In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million"
16,Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million
17,"Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year"
18,"As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53rd week"
19,Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments
20,"Sure, Lindsay"
21,"In terms of trends during the quarter certainly like you saw I think across the retail landscape, sales strengthened as we moved through the quarter"
22,"Sure, Kimberly, itâ€™s Michael Hartshorn"
23,"The delay in tax refunds, it certainly wasn't a positive for the quarter, the volatility made it a little bit more challenging to plan and operate the business"
24,"It's hard to say, though, if there was a negative impact to the overall quarter from the refunds"
25,"I'll give you some stats also on regional performance for us, Southeast, Florida and the Midwest"
26,"were the top performing regions, the Midwest continues to be very strong region for us as it's been a top performing region for over three years"
27,Iâ€™d call out other major markets; California was slightly below the chain average given the unfavorable weather with the storms during the quarter
28,Texas performed in line with the chain and that's an improvement from the second half of 2016 when it was below the chain average
29,"Sure, Paul"
30,We expect wages to abate in the second half of the year as we anniversary the most recent wage increases that took place in last year's second quarter for us
31,"So our guidance, though, still for the year assumes an SG&A leverage point at about 3% which is in line with historical averages"
32,"No, we haven't changed our outlook, Paul, even though we exceeded merch margins by 15 basis points during the quarter, though that was primarily driven by above plan sales which allowed us to leverage markdowns and drive the business with close-outs"
33,Just after one quarter we wouldnâ€™t change our outlook for the year
34,"So we didn't say specifically on the basis point impact though, beginning in Q4 we did -- have seen a tightening of carrier rates as well as fuel costs that are up against some very low levels last year"
35,Right now we expect freight cost to be a headwind for the remainder of the year
36,and that's reflected in our guidance
37,"Sure, David"
38,So in the first quarter DC is levered by about 15 basis points and that was all due to both efficiencies in the DCs and also fixed cost leverage
39,So we would certainly over the next couple years expect to see â€“ add some ability to lever the fixed costs there as we don't expect additional significant investments for the next couple of years
40,"In terms of California, we continue to see comps there certainly over the last couple years, I mean we've obviously been in the market for thirty years and we continue to comp"
41,So we continue to believe we have the opportunity to comp stores there
42,"Sure, Brian"
43,"The closures were fairly recent and late in the quarter, so the impact would have been barely minor to the quarter"
44,"Over the long term, though, fewer stores, fewer competitors certainly create more market share opportunities for us which should be a positive factor for the business"
45,"No, I wouldn't change anything that we said in our initial call, Ike, earlier in the year that we expect going into the year that we expected merchandise margins to be relatively flat"
46,And to call out at this point that we think freight will be a headwind to the remainder of the year
47,"No, we will give â€"
48,“ we will update the back half comp when we give our release in August
49,"Iâ€™ll just you to, when we started the year we expected one to two, so it would be pretty similar across the rest of the year"
