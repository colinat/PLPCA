33,Question-and-Answer Session
34,"In terms of a product this year versus last year, what I would say is that our business is performing â€"
35,“ our performance is pretty broad-based right now
36,So we feel good as we enter into the fourth quarter that both our apparel and non-apparel businesses are working well
37,"In terms of difference on the floor, what I would say is you'll see an expansion of gifts"
38,"And I think in terms of values on the floor, there's been a lot of availability in the market, and we've had solid execution by the merchants all year"
39,And that translates to good values in fashions on the floor for the fourth quarter
40,Sure
41,"I would say that there aren't any really strong, strong fashion trends out there"
42,"I mean, there's some smaller trends, but something that would be â€“ would change the course of what you were doing going from a skinny jeans, to a wide-legged pants"
43,There's no major fashion trend
44,"So I think that's part of the issue as you go through, particularly in ladies' apparel, that there are any real drivers out there"
45,"The trends that are out there, however, we have in our assortment and because we've been able to execute at such a high level and have liquidity, we've been able to take availability and get in season goods"
46,"And so we feel pretty good about our assortments as we enter into the fourth quarter, but I actually think a big part of the fashion quotient in the ladies' business is the lack of fashion to be honest"
47,Thanks
48,"In terms of performance, the ladies' business performed slightly behind the chain average, and home performed slightly ahead of the chain average"
49,"And in ladies', as you would expect, that's a difficult business in the outside world, so we were pleased with that performance and continue to work on that business"
50,In terms of Q4 merchandise margin
51,Sure
52,"And in terms of non-apparel and the product mix as it relates to the store, first, we decide what businesses we want to drive and what trends we want to drive"
53,"In terms of utilizing square footage, since we've cut our inventory 40% over the last six years or so, that space is an issue in terms of maximizing that space"
54,We drive that base off of really what products we want to drive and put in front of the customer
55,We don't necessarily just say we want to build the space we say what is that she really wants and can we deliver compelling bargains and then that's how we decide how we're going to expand the business
56,"And in terms of businesses, you're asking me what businesses we like to expand go forward?"
57,I mean we really wouldn't
58,discuss it on the call so
59,"We're always trying to diversify the mix in the store but giving specifics on the call, we wouldn't talk to"
60,"And in terms of the Kid's business, the performance was broad-based so it was every segment, infants, boys, girls"
61,And we've had really solid execution in there
62,And so we were able to chase a lot of that business and offer compelling bargains to the customer
63,"So the way we think about packaway is, there's no definitive number we go out there thinking about it with"
64,We really do it based off of what the merchandise that's offered out there is for us
65,"So if it's a great deal, we buy it"
66,And so that oftentimes builds to the number that you get to
67,You're trying to get to â€
68,“ if we're chasing business by pack it away because sometimes there are compelling bargains of seasonal goods
69,So if it's sweaters or outerwear or things like that you want to pack that away because you can use those to open the season and to drive sales until you get more availability in the marketplace
70,"So we feel good about packaway, and we feel very good about the contents of the packaway that we have right now"
71,"Well, it's been promotional all year"
72,What I really think is that it will be more promotional
73,It's already started to be promotional
74,"We are starting earlier, and then that last-minute push up at the very end, our expectation is that it will be more promotional than it was last year as part of that is to believe, but I do believe that"
75,"And so we're trying to posture ourselves understanding that, that's what that looks like"
76,Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores
