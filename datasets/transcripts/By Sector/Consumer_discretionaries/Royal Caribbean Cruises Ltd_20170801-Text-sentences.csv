0,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone"
1,I'm really very pleased to be able to speak with you all this morning and to give you some color on where we are
2,"At the beginning of the year, I commented that we sensed an intangible tone in the market that was as good as or better than any time I could recall"
3,"This tone was hard to pinpoint or to define, but it gave us a very tangible sense that 2017 could be a particularly positive year"
4,"Since then, the outlook has only gotten better"
5,Our earnings forecast now exceed even the high end of our original range of expectations
6,"In a normal year, we have a lot of pluses and minuses and they usually balance each other out"
7,"But this year, we are experiencing many more positive forces than negative ones"
8,Part of this appears to be industry-wide
9,"People have bought all the stuff that they need, and they're now looking towards gaining more experiences"
10,"Instead of buying TVs and cars, they seem to be buying memories as never before"
11,Since we're in an industry that specializes in providing great memories that trend plays to our sweet spot
12,"Even better, the trend shows no respect for borders and seems to be occurring all around the world"
13,Our sailings in the U.S
14,", Europe, Alaska, Baltic, Asia, all demonstrate this marvelous phenomenon"
15,"Now, looking to next year, we're conscious of the fact that a particularly strong 2017 also provides particularly difficult comparables for 2018."
16,"This is definitely a very nice problem to have, but it is nevertheless a very real issue"
17,"On top of this marvelous industry-wide growth in demand, we're also seeing powerful drivers coming from the unique positioning of our special brands"
18,All of our brands are performing at a level we've simply never seen
19,"Our guest satisfaction ratings are at the highest point in our history, and they keep rising"
20,"Our onboard revenue figures are doing well, both in terms of sales and satisfaction"
21,"Some of this is driven by our wonderful new ships, such as Harmony of the Seas, Mein Schiff 6, Symphony of the Seas or Celebrity Edge, but much of it also comes from greater engagement by our officers and our crew"
22,"This is very much of a people business, and it is all about the people"
23,"In addition, there are a few specific programs at Royal Caribbean that have proven very attractive in driving change"
24,"The first, of course, is our DOUBLE-DOUBLE"
25,This program has been extremely successful in galvanizing our entire workforce to a common set of goals
26,"You all heard me say before that if we give our people focus and a clear vision, nothing stops them from achieving extraordinary results"
27,The success of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE provides very tangible proof of that fact
28,"For that, I extend to all of them my sincerest thanks"
29,"Remember, however, that the DOUBLE-DOUBLE was never just about 2017."
30,It's always been about positioning Royal Caribbean to the future
31,"I believe that's the real success of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE, not just the 2017 results"
32,"As we approach the end of DOUBLE-DOUBLE, we are putting thought into providing direction again for a multi-year period"
33,"As you know, our mantra is continuous improvement, so I wouldn't expect our next announcement to be simply a clone of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE"
34,"First of all, that would be boring"
35,But also we need to focus on the drivers of success
36,So I would expect that that's the kind of picture that we would be painting
37,"I know that the some of you have suggestions for the structure of this program, and you are absolutely free to share them with us"
38,Be aware that any good idea you come up with will be shamelessly stolen without any credit to the author
39,"Now, as part of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE, we've adopted a number of specific initiatives that support our overall objectives"
40,"One of these is our price integrity program, which some of you have asked about"
41,"Fortunately, we've only good news on that front"
42,"As we had predicted, the early stages of the program cost us revenue in both 2015 and 2016."
43,"That hurt, but once we established our consistency and credibility with the travel agents, with the public and with our own revenue managers, the benefits started flowing in"
44,"Today, it's clear that the program is accomplishing our goal of rewarding those who book early, while disincentivizing those who push for last-minute discounts"
45,The key to this success has been consistency
46,We don't do it only when it's painless or convenient
47,"We maintain the program even when it hurts, and sometimes we have to let cabins sail empty"
48,"That goes against every one of our instincts, but the focus and the discipline have proven their value"
49,"Ironically, the program has been so successful that we're now expecting to achieve a record load factor this year"
50,"That, in turn, causes slightly higher operating costs per lower berth, but obviously the bottom line impact is very positive"
51,"Now, since we last spoke, there have been several other developments, which I'd like to touch on today"
52,"First, we announced the deployment of the first Quantum Ultra sailing in China in 2019."
53,"With the Quantum class of ships, we're giving the most technologically-advanced hardware to a market that is very digitally focused"
54,This move is a continuation of our strategy to have premium hardware in China
55,"And that strategy is what has enabled us to gain and to hold a leadership position in the eyes of the Chinese consumers, such that today, Quantum is essentially synonymous with cruising in China"
56,"It's hard to believe, but we've now been operating there for almost 10 years"
57,"There's been a tremendous growth during this period of time, and we're finding that China is starting to behave more like a typical market"
58,"Most markets have ups and downs, and we've seen both in China"
59,"Most recently, the restrictions on travel to Korea have been painful"
60,"Nevertheless, throughout these variations, our outlook for the future in China has not changed"
61,"Our team on the ground is motivated, focused and making strides in driving the evolution of cruise distribution and destinations"
62,"Speaking of evolution, one of the most important and most quickly changing is the use of digital tools for marketing, for product development and for delivering and enhancing the consumer experience"
63,"We are proud to have focused on this for several years, and that gives us a leg-up on expanding our capabilities"
64,"We're currently working on what some might call version 2.0 of our capabilities, but, as I previously reported, we've dubbed it Project Excalibur"
65,One advantage with Excalibur is that we already have years of experience in the area that allows us to build on
66,"In addition, because we spent so much effort during these developmental years, we have an infrastructure in place today that allows us to scale our innovations quickly"
67,"For example, we expect to have Excalibur functioning on 15% of our fleet within five months of today, and over half of our fleet by the end of next year"
68,I said before that our efforts in this arena are not nice to have
69,They are vital to keeping cruises relevant as a great vacation experience
70,We are also aware that several of our competitors have announced plans to expand their digital capabilities as well
71,"We welcome those plans, too, because it will make cruising even more powerful as a relevant vacation option"
72,Another aspect of the business that's sometimes underappreciated is the work to ensure the ocean and the communities surrounding it are healthy and protected
73,"We're very proud that the World Wildlife Fund is our long-term partner in this journey, and they are the gold standard in environmental stewardship"
74,"With their help, we have established specific and measurable targets related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship"
75,We remain committed to this effort
76,And we look forward to following a path to achieve our long-term targets in this endeavor as well as on the financial front
77,"As you can see, we've got lots of reasons to feel optimistic about the future"
78,Demand is good
79,We're attracting new guests
80,We're developing young markets
81,Our employees are happy
82,All of this positions us beautifully for long-term success
83,"With that, it's a pleasure to hand the call back over to Jason"
84,Jason?
85,Yes
86,"I think, Jason, the answer, it wasn't intended to be particularly conservative"
87,I think it really was just tended to say this is really proving to be an exceptionally good year
88,"And sometimes, there's a tendency to extrapolate whatever happens this year, next year will be another good year where again everything seems to be going in the right direction"
89,And this was just more a cautionary tone that next year does look very good
90,And everything we said about it is very positive of bookings
91,"Bookings continue to be at, in fact, a higher rate and a higher amount than we've experienced in this wonderful year"
92,But it's rare that we just see everything going as well as it has this year
93,Yeah
94,"And, Felicia, another thing as part of what you've just commented on, our new ships are really doing very well"
95,"The Symphony of the Seas, which is delivering next spring, is another home run for us, much as Harmony has been"
96,"Edge is also doing extraordinarily well, but Edge doesn't deliver till very much at the end of the year"
97,So we won't actually have that benefit really until 2019.
98,"But, yeah, 2018, it's looking to be a good year"
99,"But, again, I guess I always have to say there always seem to be some headwinds that you run into"
100,Foreign exchange has gone both ways for us
101,"This year compared to last year, it's about neutral"
102,But it's improved in the last few months
103,"So overall, I think we're feeling very strong, but always worried that there are these uncertainties that always seem to come up and temper that enthusiasm"
104,"Robin, again, this is a nice problem to have, but sometimes we do feel that we shouldn't get too booked because we give up opportunities at higher prices"
105,And so that is a dialogue that goes on here everyday
106,We still are at record levels
107,And simply the question is do we want to continue to expand that
108,"or do we want to raise our prices a little bit and, in fact, slow down the booking velocity"
109,"That's exactly what's happening, and it's a debate that we had here every day"
110,"So, Tim, as you said, you can but don't necessarily want to just keep expanding that"
111,"And it's a trade-off between the way you think the demand is and you don't want to so fill up, that you don't have space available to accept demand at a higher price later"
112,"I think earlier this year, I actually made the comment, going back to something Robin said, that we were at a record level and probably wouldn't go higher than the load factors we had when we crossed the year at the end of last year"
113,But we've continued to actually inch up a little bit from those levels and that's because our operating people and our revenue management people feel that there is a benefit to doing that
114,"And, again, it's exactly the things that Felicia talked about"
115,"You, therefore, have less to sell"
116,"so you can raise your prices on that additional amount to sell, et cetera"
117,And that's a trade-off
118,"As I said, earlier this year, I actually predicted that last year was not only a record, but was the record and that we wouldn't want it to go higher"
119,"And since then, we've actually let it go a little bit higher"
120,"But, as you say, we're probably reaching the peak of that, which is a good thing"
121,"And it simply means that we are spending our time focusing on how do we ratchet up the price, as opposed to ratcheting out the booking curve"
122,Yeah
123,"I'm not sure, unfortunately, that there are that many fewer incidents"
124,"I do think people have a little bit, your latter point, acclimated to them and see them as perhaps less relevant to them"
125,"I'm not sure that's a good sign for society, but that's a positive sign for the cruise business"
126,I also think there is a perception that this is a good vacation to be doing
127,"And so I think overall, at least the kind of pattern that we are experiencing today, it seems to be less of an issue"
128,I'm not sure that we'd be willing to extrapolate that to all kinds of issues or all levels of intensity or frequency
129,"Hi, Assia"
130,", I tried to say it was purely caution"
131,We're having an extraordinarily good year in an extraordinarily strong market
132,"And I think it behooves us to say that not everything goes your way every time, but the objective facts are very positive"
133,"The weak dollar, first of all, I have trouble calling it a weak dollar, because when we look at, for example, our DOUBLE-DOUBLE, the strong dollar has been an enormous headwind"
134,"And I think one of the reasons that we're feeling so good about 2017 is to have reached our DOUBLE-DOUBLE goals or about to reach our DOUBLE-DOUBLE goals in the face of the very strong headwinds of the strong dollar, really makes us feel quite good"
135,"The slightly less strong dollar, I'm going to use it, I'm going to describe it that way"
136,Yeah
137,Is the glass half full or half empty?
138,The slightly less strong dollar is actually helpful to us in every which way
139,and so this is a positive for us after so long of facing these headwinds
140,And I remind you that the dollar strength for 2017 is ending up about where it was in 2016 on our trade-weighted basis
141,The difference is it's gotten better
142,It rose up
143,The dollar got stronger by the end of April of this year
144,and then it got weaker again
145,"But we're basically back to where we were last year, no stronger, no weaker"
146,So I would feel very happy if we simply can carry on with another year without more headwinds
147,"But again, I do want to make it clear, we view the weaker dollar as positive for us overall, balancing those things that are helpful and those things that are harmful"
148,"But do remember, we're nearing the end of the season there"
149,So I think at this stage
150,Yeah
151,"Yes, exactly"
152,"Thanks, Assia"
153,"Dan, you did cheat to go over, but I'll cheat to add to Jason's comment"
154,"Remember, I know everybody's focus tends to be on the guest-facing activities and those are the ones that are easier to monetize"
155,But we view this whole process as multi-dimensional
156,"And so a lot of it is relating to data analytics, data science"
157,It's the marketing program
158,"But a lot of it's also to make us better in delivering, so these are tools that are available to our crew members"
159,"These are things that reduce the friction for them in coming to the ship and being employed and all the work that they have to do, tools that make them better at producing the service"
160,"We also use it for safety features, better supply logistics"
161,"So it's a really multi-dimensional tool that I just would emphasize, the more visible part will be the kind of guest-facing things that we talked about"
162,"But I would not underestimate the importance, long-run, in terms of our position in the market, in terms of our ability to produce these kinds of revenues of the other aspects of the tools"
