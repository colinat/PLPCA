Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone
I'm really very pleased to be able to speak with you all this morning and to give you some color on where we are
At the beginning of the year, I commented that we sensed an intangible tone in the market that was as good as or better than any time I could recall
This tone was hard to pinpoint or to define, but it gave us a very tangible sense that 2017 could be a particularly positive year
Since then, the outlook has only gotten better
Our earnings forecast now exceed even the high end of our original range of expectations
In a normal year, we have a lot of pluses and minuses and they usually balance each other out
But this year, we are experiencing many more positive forces than negative ones
Part of this appears to be industry-wide
People have bought all the stuff that they need, and they're now looking towards gaining more experiences
Instead of buying TVs and cars, they seem to be buying memories as never before
Since we're in an industry that specializes in providing great memories that trend plays to our sweet spot
Even better, the trend shows no respect for borders and seems to be occurring all around the world
Our sailings in the U.S
, Europe, Alaska, Baltic, Asia, all demonstrate this marvelous phenomenon
Now, looking to next year, we're conscious of the fact that a particularly strong 2017 also provides particularly difficult comparables for 2018. This is definitely a very nice problem to have, but it is nevertheless a very real issue
On top of this marvelous industry-wide growth in demand, we're also seeing powerful drivers coming from the unique positioning of our special brands
All of our brands are performing at a level we've simply never seen
Our guest satisfaction ratings are at the highest point in our history, and they keep rising
Our onboard revenue figures are doing well, both in terms of sales and satisfaction
Some of this is driven by our wonderful new ships, such as Harmony of the Seas, Mein Schiff 6, Symphony of the Seas or Celebrity Edge, but much of it also comes from greater engagement by our officers and our crew
This is very much of a people business, and it is all about the people
In addition, there are a few specific programs at Royal Caribbean that have proven very attractive in driving change
The first, of course, is our DOUBLE-DOUBLE
This program has been extremely successful in galvanizing our entire workforce to a common set of goals
You all heard me say before that if we give our people focus and a clear vision, nothing stops them from achieving extraordinary results
The success of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE provides very tangible proof of that fact
For that, I extend to all of them my sincerest thanks
Remember, however, that the DOUBLE-DOUBLE was never just about 2017. It's always been about positioning Royal Caribbean to the future
I believe that's the real success of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE, not just the 2017 results
As we approach the end of DOUBLE-DOUBLE, we are putting thought into providing direction again for a multi-year period
As you know, our mantra is continuous improvement, so I wouldn't expect our next announcement to be simply a clone of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE
First of all, that would be boring
But also we need to focus on the drivers of success
So I would expect that that's the kind of picture that we would be painting
I know that the some of you have suggestions for the structure of this program, and you are absolutely free to share them with us
Be aware that any good idea you come up with will be shamelessly stolen without any credit to the author
Now, as part of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE, we've adopted a number of specific initiatives that support our overall objectives
One of these is our price integrity program, which some of you have asked about
Fortunately, we've only good news on that front
As we had predicted, the early stages of the program cost us revenue in both 2015 and 2016. That hurt, but once we established our consistency and credibility with the travel agents, with the public and with our own revenue managers, the benefits started flowing in
Today, it's clear that the program is accomplishing our goal of rewarding those who book early, while disincentivizing those who push for last-minute discounts
The key to this success has been consistency
We don't do it only when it's painless or convenient
We maintain the program even when it hurts, and sometimes we have to let cabins sail empty
That goes against every one of our instincts, but the focus and the discipline have proven their value
Ironically, the program has been so successful that we're now expecting to achieve a record load factor this year
That, in turn, causes slightly higher operating costs per lower berth, but obviously the bottom line impact is very positive
Now, since we last spoke, there have been several other developments, which I'd like to touch on today
First, we announced the deployment of the first Quantum Ultra sailing in China in 2019. With the Quantum class of ships, we're giving the most technologically-advanced hardware to a market that is very digitally focused
This move is a continuation of our strategy to have premium hardware in China
And that strategy is what has enabled us to gain and to hold a leadership position in the eyes of the Chinese consumers, such that today, Quantum is essentially synonymous with cruising in China
It's hard to believe, but we've now been operating there for almost 10 years
There's been a tremendous growth during this period of time, and we're finding that China is starting to behave more like a typical market
Most markets have ups and downs, and we've seen both in China
Most recently, the restrictions on travel to Korea have been painful
Nevertheless, throughout these variations, our outlook for the future in China has not changed
Our team on the ground is motivated, focused and making strides in driving the evolution of cruise distribution and destinations
Speaking of evolution, one of the most important and most quickly changing is the use of digital tools for marketing, for product development and for delivering and enhancing the consumer experience
We are proud to have focused on this for several years, and that gives us a leg-up on expanding our capabilities
We're currently working on what some might call version 2.0 of our capabilities, but, as I previously reported, we've dubbed it Project Excalibur
One advantage with Excalibur is that we already have years of experience in the area that allows us to build on
In addition, because we spent so much effort during these developmental years, we have an infrastructure in place today that allows us to scale our innovations quickly
For example, we expect to have Excalibur functioning on 15% of our fleet within five months of today, and over half of our fleet by the end of next year
I said before that our efforts in this arena are not nice to have
They are vital to keeping cruises relevant as a great vacation experience
We are also aware that several of our competitors have announced plans to expand their digital capabilities as well
We welcome those plans, too, because it will make cruising even more powerful as a relevant vacation option
Another aspect of the business that's sometimes underappreciated is the work to ensure the ocean and the communities surrounding it are healthy and protected
We're very proud that the World Wildlife Fund is our long-term partner in this journey, and they are the gold standard in environmental stewardship
With their help, we have established specific and measurable targets related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship
We remain committed to this effort
And we look forward to following a path to achieve our long-term targets in this endeavor as well as on the financial front
As you can see, we've got lots of reasons to feel optimistic about the future
Demand is good
We're attracting new guests
We're developing young markets
Our employees are happy
All of this positions us beautifully for long-term success
With that, it's a pleasure to hand the call back over to Jason
Jason?
Yes
I think, Jason, the answer, it wasn't intended to be particularly conservative
I think it really was just tended to say this is really proving to be an exceptionally good year
And sometimes, there's a tendency to extrapolate whatever happens this year, next year will be another good year where again everything seems to be going in the right direction
And this was just more a cautionary tone that next year does look very good
And everything we said about it is very positive of bookings
Bookings continue to be at, in fact, a higher rate and a higher amount than we've experienced in this wonderful year
But it's rare that we just see everything going as well as it has this year
Yeah
And, Felicia, another thing as part of what you've just commented on, our new ships are really doing very well
The Symphony of the Seas, which is delivering next spring, is another home run for us, much as Harmony has been
Edge is also doing extraordinarily well, but Edge doesn't deliver till very much at the end of the year
So we won't actually have that benefit really until 2019. But, yeah, 2018, it's looking to be a good year
But, again, I guess I always have to say there always seem to be some headwinds that you run into
Foreign exchange has gone both ways for us
This year compared to last year, it's about neutral
But it's improved in the last few months
So overall, I think we're feeling very strong, but always worried that there are these uncertainties that always seem to come up and temper that enthusiasm
Robin, again, this is a nice problem to have, but sometimes we do feel that we shouldn't get too booked because we give up opportunities at higher prices
And so that is a dialogue that goes on here everyday
We still are at record levels
And simply the question is do we want to continue to expand that or do we want to raise our prices a little bit and, in fact, slow down the booking velocity
That's exactly what's happening, and it's a debate that we had here every day
So, Tim, as you said, you can but don't necessarily want to just keep expanding that
And it's a trade-off between the way you think the demand is and you don't want to so fill up, that you don't have space available to accept demand at a higher price later
I think earlier this year, I actually made the comment, going back to something Robin said, that we were at a record level and probably wouldn't go higher than the load factors we had when we crossed the year at the end of last year
But we've continued to actually inch up a little bit from those levels and that's because our operating people and our revenue management people feel that there is a benefit to doing that
And, again, it's exactly the things that Felicia talked about
You, therefore, have less to sell so you can raise your prices on that additional amount to sell, et cetera
And that's a trade-off
As I said, earlier this year, I actually predicted that last year was not only a record, but was the record and that we wouldn't want it to go higher
And since then, we've actually let it go a little bit higher
But, as you say, we're probably reaching the peak of that, which is a good thing
And it simply means that we are spending our time focusing on how do we ratchet up the price, as opposed to ratcheting out the booking curve
Yeah
I'm not sure, unfortunately, that there are that many fewer incidents
I do think people have a little bit, your latter point, acclimated to them and see them as perhaps less relevant to them
I'm not sure that's a good sign for society, but that's a positive sign for the cruise business
I also think there is a perception that this is a good vacation to be doing
And so I think overall, at least the kind of pattern that we are experiencing today, it seems to be less of an issue
I'm not sure that we'd be willing to extrapolate that to all kinds of issues or all levels of intensity or frequency
Hi, Assia, I tried to say it was purely caution
We're having an extraordinarily good year in an extraordinarily strong market
And I think it behooves us to say that not everything goes your way every time, but the objective facts are very positive
The weak dollar, first of all, I have trouble calling it a weak dollar, because when we look at, for example, our DOUBLE-DOUBLE, the strong dollar has been an enormous headwind
And I think one of the reasons that we're feeling so good about 2017 is to have reached our DOUBLE-DOUBLE goals or about to reach our DOUBLE-DOUBLE goals in the face of the very strong headwinds of the strong dollar, really makes us feel quite good
The slightly less strong dollar, I'm going to use it, I'm going to describe it that way
Yeah
Is the glass half full or half empty? The slightly less strong dollar is actually helpful to us in every which way and so this is a positive for us after so long of facing these headwinds
And I remind you that the dollar strength for 2017 is ending up about where it was in 2016 on our trade-weighted basis
The difference is it's gotten better
It rose up
The dollar got stronger by the end of April of this year and then it got weaker again
But we're basically back to where we were last year, no stronger, no weaker
So I would feel very happy if we simply can carry on with another year without more headwinds
But again, I do want to make it clear, we view the weaker dollar as positive for us overall, balancing those things that are helpful and those things that are harmful
But do remember, we're nearing the end of the season there
So I think at this stage
Yeah
Yes, exactly
Thanks, Assia
Dan, you did cheat to go over, but I'll cheat to add to Jason's comment
Remember, I know everybody's focus tends to be on the guest-facing activities and those are the ones that are easier to monetize
But we view this whole process as multi-dimensional
And so a lot of it is relating to data analytics, data science
It's the marketing program
But a lot of it's also to make us better in delivering, so these are tools that are available to our crew members
These are things that reduce the friction for them in coming to the ship and being employed and all the work that they have to do, tools that make them better at producing the service
We also use it for safety features, better supply logistics
So it's a really multi-dimensional tool that I just would emphasize, the more visible part will be the kind of guest-facing things that we talked about
But I would not underestimate the importance, long-run, in terms of our position in the market, in terms of our ability to produce these kinds of revenues of the other aspects of the tools
