Thanks, John
As you have been hearing from many of the industry peers, this continues to be a challenging competitive and consumer environment
That’s why we are particularly pleased by the ongoing progress we saw in the second quarter when we gained further momentum in the areas that we are already performing well and so improvement in the areas where performance needed more focus and our aggressive has come from both stores and digital channels, wherever our guests wants to shop us
From market share perspective, we saw broad-based market share gains across all ad discretionary categories
In hardlines, comparable sales grew between 3% and 4% in the second quarter, the strongest performance we have seen in 10 years
Growth in this area was broad-based including double-digit growth in both videogames driven by Nintendo switch and Apple within electronics
Toys grew more than 3% with board games continuing to be a strong highlight
This is an area where we already enjoy a leading market share position, but continue to grow and take further share due to our focus on innovation and differentiation within our assortment
Our apparel and home categories both grew sales and market share in these tough markets
In apparel, growth was widespread across subcategories as guests responded to fashion and newness all underpinned by value through great price right daily items
We were particularly pleased with the ongoing positive performance in kids, which continues to benefit from last year’s launch of Cat & Jack and is now achieving strong year-on-year sales growth and in our strong swim business
Like a performance in board games, we came to the year with the number one market share in swim and have extended that lead to become the clear destination for swim in the U.S
In home, digital was an important growth driver and we saw particularly strong performance from our threshold brand
We are also very pleased with the performance of our seasonal businesses from greeting cards to outdoor furniture
Within the seasonal event moments, our 4th of July holiday was strong as we quickly leverage guest and business insights from Memorial Day
In essentials, comp sales were up almost 1% benefiting from the launch of our Target Run and Done campaign that began in the first quarter
We are pleased with the response from our guests specifically with awareness and return on ad spend for this campaign, where results are higher than average
The top two messages guests recall from the campaign are that Target is convenient and I can fulfill all of my need to Target, which were our cool campaign goals
Essentials are also seeing the early benefit from our work to improve our value perception
Specifically, when we are price right daily on key audit and essentials, we are seeing increased traffic and unit sales trends
As Brian mentioned earlier, comp sales in the food and beverage category have stabilized and were flat in the second quarter
We are seeing improvement based on our work to improve freshness and reliability as well as the work on value perception
In produce, we saw high single-digit comp increases in the second quarter driven by even stronger growth in organics
And in adult beverage, we saw ongoing double-digit comp growth driven by assortment and display enhancements we have been rolling out across the country
Importantly, we continue to build food and beverage expertise on our team
Following the hiring of Jeff Burt to lead food and beverage in merchandising at the end of the first quarter, we announced that we have hired two new members of his team earlier this week
Looking ahead, Japanese total team, are focused on building on recent momentum
We know we need to enhance our assortment of convenient options for our guests through this ready to eat, ready to heat or ready to cook and save families time and money
In addition, we are focused on enhancing our exclusive brand assortment in food and beverage, while ensuring we are priced-right daily on key opening price point items
While overall we have much more to accomplish in the third quarter, our work to improve value perception across all of our assortment is already beginning to have an impact
Specifically, surveys are showing that consumers are noticing Target’s investment in price and value and we saw a much stronger mix of regular price selling in the second quarter as we sort to simplify our promotions, clarify our voice and bring great price right daily items into focus
And it’s working
In fact, our second quarter balance of regular and promotional sales was consistent with levels we haven’t seen since 2012, well before our credit card data breach that changed our promotional cadence and stance
Also encouraging was the fact that our unit share in key categories grew more quickly in dollar share, which is a key leading indicator of the impact of this work
At a high level, our second quarter average ticket also reflects the impact of this work
At first glance, reporting a slight decline in average ticket might not sound like good news, but when it’s more than offset by an increase in traffic, the picture is more positive
As we dig into the drivers, the change in basket reflected two key factors
The first was a reduction in general incentive offers, which were replaced with better daily value pricing and more category focused discounts
The second was a meaningful increase in the number of quick trips and fill-in trips we saw from our guests
As we mentioned last year, we saw an opportunity to more appropriately balance between stock-up trips and these quicker, smaller trips
So, we are pleased to see our strategy taking hold and generating both trips and conversion
This work on value perception is about ensuring we are price-right daily on key items while delivering more thoughtful and effective promotions throughout our assortments
In many categories, this means we are reducing our everyday pricing and communicating with much more clarity building confidence among our guests
We will expand the scope of this work in the third quarter and we will continue to measure and iterate based on the response
Another aspect of our business where we are pleased with our progress is in our inventory position
We reduced out total inventory to last year by more than 4%, while improving the quality of our inventory by bringing unproductive inventory levels down to historical lows
The savings in markdowns through better sell through rates and lower inventory levels has created the capacity for us to invest in what’s new and what’s working which will position us well in the back half of the year
And we do have a lot of newness planned for the rest of the year, perhaps most notable of the new brands that either just launched or will rollout in the next few months
In addition to Cloud Island which launched in May and it’s already comping double digits, we launched Isabel Maternity in July
This new brand features the 120 key pieces designed to make every stage of maternity easy, comfortable, stylish and affordable with a focus on fit, function and fashion
And this new brand is already posting strong growth
And as we move into September, we are rolling out two new exclusive apparel brands
In women’s we are launching A New Day, an apparel and accessories brand featuring a strong feminine aesthetic through modern prints and patterns with a focus on building confidence through stylish seasonal and basic items and stories that provide the ultimate wardrobe versatility
And in men’s we are launching Goodfellow & Company, which brings the new modern interpretation of classic books, focus on the strong foundation of core items based on insights our guests tell us they want, great quality, fit and fabric, but there is more in-store
In September we will also launch Project 62, a new home brand based on modern design that is thoughtful and approachable
We also built this brand from guest insights to capture their growing demand for modern design with a focus on solving the challenges of urban living including the need for easy mobility based on potential frequent moves
Items incorporate efficiency, simplicity and great design that make urban environments both highly beautiful and functional
Shortly after in October, we are excited to launch Joy Lab, a new women’s athletic fashion apparel brand
Items were designed based on emerging street style that inspires fitness through fashion and building a community based on style and wellness taking you from crunches to brunches
Given the investment in developing this portfolio of new brands, we plan to support these launches with meaningful 360 degree investments in the way only Target can in marketing and digital on social media, in-store experiences with fixturing, mannequins and signage and in training for our store and digital teams
It will be hard to miss the amount of newness you will see during the third quarter and we expect our guests will be excited to discover that there is indeed more in the store
Our product design and development, manufacturing, merchandising and marketing teams have been incredibly agile
Having begun their work on these new brands less than 10 months ago, it’s amazing what they been able to accomplish together in this time by keeping truly aligned to our strategic choices
It adds up to a vast body of work and we can’t wait to see all of these new items in our stores and online
Our success last year in Pillowfort and Cat & Jack provided the proof of concept and gave us the confidence to begin work on these new brands
Both of those new kids brands were double digit comps in the year following their launch and they are both still growing in the second year while building trips category growth and store basket
And as Brian shared Cat & Jack is now a $2 billion brand based on sales volume in the last 12 months through July of this year, exceeding our initial expectations
Of course we haven’t forgotten the back-to-school and back-to-college key seasons which play a huge role in our third quarter results
In back-to-school comps and market share have grown for 10 years straight
And we are focused on extending that record
We continue to invest in digital to support back-to-school including our school list assist site to provide guests a convenient way to access their child supply list and easily order any or all those items to be delivered to their home
More than a million lists are already available on the site, well ahead of last year and sell through the list site have been running 4x higher than a year ago
When students go back to college mom plays a huge role in making everything happen
So we have made sure this year’s marketing speaks to moms as well as students
Hence those campuses that aren’t lucky enough to have one of the use small format stores with pondering with Barnes & Noble College which operates nearly 800 college schools around the country to offer the Target assortment more than 5 million students
And finally, given up our success, our team is really excited about the upcoming release in the Star Wars series
To get things started, we are launching our latest Star Wars assortments on September 1, which is being dubbed Force Friday
And to celebrate, we will be opening at midnight in 500 stores across the country
So okay, that’s a lot of newness
I hope you see why we are so excited at Target about all of our strategies and plans coming to life
All of that work supports our long-term vision which is to build on the strengths that have made us such unique retailer for decades
As Brian shared, we have build a brand from ends, a brand that offers the best of both mass and specialty
And we have the unique multi-category offering that allows us to drive traffic by leaning into core items and trends
And our brand is known for featuring new exclusive and truly differentiated items comprised own brands like Cat & Jack and national brands like Apple and Casper, because we are so unique, how to put in a box and we like that
We are at our best when we connect with our DNA, unleash the potential of our brand promise to expect more and to pay less, leverage our team and let Target be [indiscernible]
With that I will turn it over to Kathy who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year
Cathy?
I think firstly just on the Apple comments, they weren’t just driven by tablet, they are driven across the board in categories
And we had really strong showing in Q2 on the iWatch which we worked with Apple on clearly
And we have a lot in our plans for Q3 and Q4 with potential new launches as I have outlined
So we think there is still room for growth and continuing the trend
In terms of Nintendo Switch, we worked really closely with those guys as well to develop not only a product but a marketing campaign that the guests really responded to
And so we have been able to secure inventory and a plan all through the fourth quarter, so feeling positive about sustaining a trend there
I think that we outlined in our Q1 comments around the emergence of our strategy that we are going to be on the journey of implementation as Jeff joined us in the business
And Jeff has already come in and begun start testing and iterating new ideas and concepts on top of our strategies that are creating growth vehicles
So, we are excited about that, the new people entering our business and just creating new strength against the strategic intent
So, firstly, Liz Nordlie will add value to own brand growth potential there and strengthen our efforts there as well as Mark Kenny, really with his expertise in general grocery but specifically in the convenient meal area and in bakery etcetera
I mean, that is part of our ongoing strategic intent to strengthen and focus there
So, these are key investments in our strategy and in our team balancing them against existing talent
In regards to your query around Prime, we were really happy to see ongoing trends maintain during Prime and we had positive comps and a really strong growth in regular price business continuing through those days but on in-store and online
Yes, thanks Peter
So, let me just start with pet
I mean, we announced this month the addition of Blue Buffalo to our assortment, which is the number one brand in the U.S
and a really core assortment to get
So excited to add that into our mix and we already have a lot of data from our guests is just that they wanted to see that at Target
We also embarked on an agreement with BarkBox
So, really refocusing our accessory and our total assortment of doing business inside pet, so an exciting uptick there, because that brings further guests trips and conversion
Around the food and beverage area in terms of general assortment, we are still working on there and more to follow
I think that we have talked openly about a roster of more than 12 brands that we will be bringing to life over a period of time
We have begun that journey
That continues into 2018. It highlights definitely the signature areas, but the strength at providing differentiation exclusivity and therefore preference for Target through these is applicable to many different areas
So, we are looking at all areas and opportunities and we have some plans in place
Hi Kate, I will take that one
So our promotional efforts are really rolled through the quarter even
And we began them in first quarter in April and a second round of taking key items that comprise our guest basket and focusing on priced right daily items really took hold and then second wave in – by the end of July
The next round of that is through October and that’s when we will be coming together to have a more concise in-store marketing campaign and regular cadence of new ways [ph] to the guest to communicate value
So we think at that point that we have a strong base to maintain and this is why in half two we have been prudent in how we forecasted our sales and margin based on also unit growth initially
We see trip growth initially and we need to see that dollar growth balanced out over time
But we know that we have been patient with that, hence some of that earlier discussions at the start of the year about investing ahead of
