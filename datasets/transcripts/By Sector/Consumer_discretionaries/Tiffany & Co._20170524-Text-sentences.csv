1,"Good day, everyone"
2,"On today's conference call, Mark Erceg and I will comment on the first quarter financial results, our growth strategies and the full year outlook"
3,"Of course, before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements"
4,"Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements"
5,"Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K"
6,The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except as required by applicable law or regulation
7,Now let's proceed
8,"As an overview, Tiffany's first quarter results showed a slight increase in worldwide net sales and higher growth in net earnings and our balance sheet remains strong"
9,"We believe that those results keep us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance in light of an expectation for continued challenges from macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and a strong U.S"
10,dollar
11,"In terms of the first quarter, starting with the top line, regional results included a total sales increase in Asia-Pacific, contrasting with modest declines in the Americas, Japan and Europe, although sales in Europe actually increased on a constant exchange rate basis"
12,"In our largest region, the Americas, total and comparable store sales declined in the first quarter primarily due to lower jewelry unit volume"
13,experienced geographically mixed but generally soft performance across the country which we attributed to varying degrees of weakness in both local and foreign tourist demand
14,"Elsewhere, our business in Canada was soft while we were pleased to experience solid growth in our stores in Latin America"
15,"During the first quarter, we completed the major renovation of our store on Union Square in San Francisco and earlier this month, we relaunched our renovated and expanded store on Burrard Street in Vancouver"
16,Both stores have extraordinary new presentations to serve customers in those important markets
17,"Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific, where an increase in total sales was due to higher wholesale sales and the effect of new store openings over the past year while comps declined slightly"
18,"The regional sales growth was entirely driven by increased jewelry unit volume, with the decline in the average price per unit sold"
19,We attributed the continuation of strong sales growth in Mainland China to local customer spending
20,"Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline which we attribute to lower Chinese tourist spending, but the sales decline was only modest due to our increased focus on local clientele in that market"
21,And we continued to experience varying degrees of softness elsewhere in the region
22,"During the quarter, we closed 1 store in China that had temporarily overlapped with a new store opened last year and we relocated a store in Korea"
23,Turning to Japan
24,Total sales and comparable store sales declined slightly in the first quarter with minimal changes in jewelry unit volume and average price
25,Total sales also declined in part due to lower wholesale sales
26,We were pleased to see higher spending attributed to local customers who we believe represent about 90% of our sales in Japan
27,"As part of our efforts to further strengthen local customer sales in the important bridal category, we've recently expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to that category"
28,We've been pleased with customer's reaction to this heightened experience
29,"On the other hand, we continued to see a decline in sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan"
30,"However, as you may recall, we benefited in the first quarter of 2016 from higher sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan which then tapered off in the second quarter"
31,"During the first quarter, we closed 1 store in Japan"
32,Our business continues to gradually improve in Europe
33,Total and comp store sales in the quarter declined modestly as reported
34,"As we saw in 2016, there were varying degrees of softness across Continental Europe, but we were pleased to see a resumption of sales growth in France in the first quarter"
35,Total and comp store sales rose modestly on a constant exchange rate basis as we have been seeing healthy local currency sales growth in the U.K
36,that we attribute partly to increased demand by local customers and partly to multinational foreign tourist spending in London tied to the weak British pound
37,There were modest changes in the average price per jewelry unit sold and unit volume
38,Sales in the other segments had a big increase in the quarter but that was mostly due to an increase in our wholesale sales of diamonds with comp store sales roughly unchanged
39,"Given our focus on improving top line growth going forward, it's worth reiterating four important global strategies to do so, first, continuing to pursue clienteling and CRM strategies to more effectively engage with customers and enhance their Tiffany experience; second, adding newness to the product assortment at a faster pace; third, optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and, in limited cases, some closings; and fourth, enhancing brand awareness through effective marketing communication"
40,We believe these are the key ingredients to achieve better sales growth in the future by increasing the frequency of customer store visit and improving the conversion rate
41,"Rounding out the sales review, global e-commerce sales were roughly unchanged in the first quarter, but as we've said before, our website served an important dual function of generating online sales while also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic"
42,"From a product perspective in the first quarter, we were pleased with fashion jewelry sales which, once again, performed relatively better than our other categories"
43,"Fashion jewelry which represented 33% of worldwide sales in 2016, primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry"
44,"In the first quarter, while gold jewelry sales led the category's growth, highlighted by the Tiffany T collection, we were pleased that fashion silver jewelry sales were modestly above last year led by the Return to Tiffany collection"
45,Sales of the 1837 collection were also up nicely
46,"And a few weeks ago, we launched the new hardware collection which spanned gold and silver in a range of styles and price points and customer feedback has been positive"
47,"Looking forward, additional designs in the T and hardware collections are planned for this fall"
48,"Designer jewelry sales which represented 12% of worldwide sales in 2016, posted healthy growth in the quarter"
49,"The category consists of the designs of Elsa Peretti, highlighted by her Diamonds by the Yard and open heart designs; and the designs of Paloma Picasso which include her new Paloma's Melody collection"
50,"The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category which represented 28% of worldwide sales in 2016, continued to underperform relative to our expectation and to the prior year"
51,"And performance in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category which represented approximately 20% of worldwide sales in 2016, was mixed"
52,"Our Victoria collection continued to perform well, though this performance was offset by softness in other collections in this category"
53,"And regarding high jewelry, we were pleased with our annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April"
54,The event serves to highlight our extraordinary designs and craftsmanship and to strengthen our relationships with our top clients from around the world
55,We were pleased with the response to the event
56,"I should add that our sales growth in the watch category is encouraging, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, as we continue to expand brand awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs that are planned for later this year"
57,"Rounding out the product overview, I'll just add that we're looking forward to this fall when we plan to launch our luxury accessories collection and a new signature fragrance for women"
58,And now Mark Erceg will comment on additional financial highlights as well as our outlook
59,That concludes this conference call
60,"Operator, please provide our audience with the replay information and I look forward to catching up with some of you soon"
