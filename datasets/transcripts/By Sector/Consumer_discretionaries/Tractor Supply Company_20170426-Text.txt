Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone
For the quarter ended April 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $1.56 billion, resulting in net income of $60.3 million and earnings per share of $0.46 per diluted share
Comparable store sales decreased 2.2% versus a reported increase of 4.9% last year
As a reminder, our Q1 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's comparable store sales increase would have been 2.6%
As we indicated in our last earnings call, we anticipated Q1 to be a challenging sales quarter
If you recall the first quarter last year benefited from very cold weather in January, which drove the sale of winter related items
Q1 of last year also benefited from both warm March temperatures and an early Easter, which drove sales of early spring merchandise
Unfortunately, we experienced a complete opposite situation in first quarter 2017. In this year's first quarter, January and February weather was very warm, and we then had cooler temperatures and snow in March
January and February's warmer than normal conditions of this year impacted demand for winter seasonal products
Additionally, the March winter storms, which primarily hit the Midwest and Northeast, but also reached down into parts of the Southern regions quickly silenced any early demand for spring seasonal products
The impact on comp sales from softness in seasonal products was relatively equal between winter and spring seasonal goods
Sales were weakest in the Northern regions of the country where the impact of weather was most pronounced, both in winter and spring seasonal products
The Southern regions were less impacted by the weather conditions, but we're cycling a tough compare from last year's strong performance
The difference in comp sales performance between the Northern and Southern regions, excluding the Western region was approximately 600 basis points
The Western region which experienced less weather volatility had a solid mid single-digit comp sales growth
We continue to see strength in the Western region as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share
We continue to experience increased demand for many of our basic everyday items, such as our livestock and pet category, which generated low single-digit comparable chain-wide sales
Excluding the impact of certain weather influenced categories, such as bird feeding, animal health and fencing, we continue to be pleased with the overall performance of this category
While there is a seasonal component to the livestock and pet category, we were pleased with the continued increase in comp units and sales dollars in the pet food and animal feed categories
And we see no evidence that we are losing market share in this core area of the business
Comp transaction count decreased 1.4% compared to a reported 4.2% increase last year or 2.6% in the prior year adjusted for the week shift
The growth in many of our C
items such as pet and animal food was more than offset by the lack of demand in winter seasonal products such as heating units and insulated outerwear and spring seasonal products such as lawn and garden, animal health and ag chemicals
The average ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points
Big ticket sales declined and deflation were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease
Comparable sales of big ticket items were down high single-digits year-over-year
The comparable sales decline of big ticket items was primarily driven by a slower start to spring seasonal products such as riding lawn mowers, 3-point equipment and trailers, as well as continued softness in the safe business
Deflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 50 basis points, driven principally by heating fuel, bird feed, livestock feed and lubricant categories
As Greg stated, the weather shifted to more typical spring conditions in early April
And as a result, we have seen consumer demand increase
Also as a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those will fall into the store base, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 60 basis points to 33.1%, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the prior year
In certain cold weather seasonal products where there was limited demand, we increased markdowns to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position
Additionally, we were slightly more promotional in our efforts to drive sales by creating value for our customer
Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight intensive categories, growth in our e-commerce business and to a lesser extent, higher average fuel costs
The mix of merchandise had a slightly negative impact on gross margin
This was driven by the strength of sales in C
product, specifically animal and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories
Petsense provided a benefit to gross margin as they produced a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores
Also, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter margin benefited approximately 15 basis points from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% of sales in the prior year's quarter
The primary driver of the deleverage was the decline in comparable store sales
A few other factors impacting SG&A ratio were Petsense, which operates at a higher SG&A rate and a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience
And then as a partial offset to the deleverage, we estimate that incentive compensation provided approximately 35 basis points of year-over-year leverage
Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 36.8% last year
The reduction in rate is principally due to the favorable impact of the adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises
The impact is typically strongest in the first quarter due to the timing of equity vesting and a smaller income base in Q1. And thus, we do not expect similar benefit in future quarters
We continue to estimate our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%
Turning to the balance sheet
At the end of the first quarter, we had a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $75 million and $250 million outstanding debt last year
During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.6 million shares for $115 million
The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 3.4% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average
Exclusive of Petsense average inventory levels per store increased 4.2%, principally due to the timing of our spring seasonal build and to some extent, the timing of seasonal sales
With respect to our outlook, we are not updating our guidance at this time, as we have said for many years, we know that weather can impact the timing of sales this time of the year and we believe it's best to evaluate our performance based on the halves rather than the quarters
While our Q1 performance was disappointing, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring summer season, therefore we believe, it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter
That concludes our prepared remarks
Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
No, I will just say I agree, because Steve hit that important point, Seth in that, it's the input costs that are a key part to that
So, our deflation calculation is not quoting situations where there maybe retail declines without a cost change
Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
Simeon, Kurt
A couple things on that
So we continue to evaluate our long-term targets, and as just a reminder, our long-term targets that we've set is high single-digit total sales growth, which include some solid comp store sales in that picture
To Greg's point, one quarter of tough weather conditions or a couple of quarters there are not going to change our long-term targets
We still see the strength in the business, and our sales growth driving initiative ability to drive the high single-digit sales growth
One reminder is, when it comes to Q2, I think as was mentioned, in Q2, we do have one less comp sales day, that we know is part of the headwind that we're facing as part of Q2.
Yeah, Michael
First as we said, given the seasonality of the business and the weather conditions in first quarter, we're not updating guidance at this time
Reminding that first quarter is the lowest volume sales and earnings quarter for that, that's the primary reason, it's about 15% of sales and earnings for the year
So at this point with being so early in the year and we recognize those factors that you brought up, at this point, it's just too early to give any guidance on the year
Yeah, Stephen, Kurt, I'll address the second part of it
And it might be helpful as a data point to refer back to our pull forward discussion from last year
At the end our Q1, we estimated that number at about $18 million
And then, as we reported Q2 and saw the results in April more information settled we estimated at about $25 million
To have it more of a comparable number for this year, with the week shift in moving that week into Q1, but April shifting to Q2, our estimate is for this quarter, it was about a $15 million deferral into the second quarter
How that plays out in the second quarter, weather as well as Easter timing plays into it, so some of that there in the first part of April, but the rest of it really can play into just as the weather hits in various spots, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast
So I wouldn't say it's something that was immediate all in the first few weeks of April, it really plays more into the weather conditions in areas such as the North
I would say that we are seeing a little bit more of deflation than our original expectations
And we still believe that we're seeing signs that it would moderate in the back half of the year
So, as we saw 50 basis points in Q1, I would say our expectation on deflation is more like a 20 basis points to 30 basis point impact for the year, with that being closer to the high end of that range in Q2 and moderating in the back half
Sure, Alan I'll take those
First in regards to the e-commerce and the gross margin, we called out the growth in e-commerce and its impact on freight
So, with our e-commerce business growing, it does have a higher freight rate and we've always had some level of burden, but e-commerce as small as it is, it's not had much of an impact, we are excited about the growth we have in the e-commerce business and we have seen a few basis points increase in the burden on the freight line within gross margin
So, we called it out
I believe that we'll see that continue in the future quarters
And as our e-commerce business grows, it could have a 1 basis points or 2 basis points impact throughout the year on the gross margin rate
And then – yeah, go ahead
In regards to the oil patch, I'd first say that the Texas region like much of the South had less of an impact on weather
So, we did not see as much volatility in sales in the Texas area, but specific to the oil patch, as Greg mentioned, we see it moderating and in the quarter we had a close to 30 basis point headwind against the – 30 basis points headwind on the comps due to the oil patch stores
