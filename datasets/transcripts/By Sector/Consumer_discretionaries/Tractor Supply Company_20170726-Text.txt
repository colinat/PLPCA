Thanks, Greg and good afternoon, everyone
For the quarter ended July 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $2.02 billion, resulting in net income of $160.6 million and EPS of $1.25 per diluted share
Comparable store sales increased 2.2% versus a reported decrease of 0.5% last year
As a reminder, our Q2 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last quarter's second quarter comparable store sales increase would have been a positive 1.0%
Also, this year's second quarter had one less sales day compared to the second quarter of 2016. We estimate the one less sales day impacted comparable store sales by approximately 60 basis points, and the comp store sales increase would have been approximately 2.8% on an equivalent quarter basis
Comp store sales performance rebounded nicely from the 2.2% decline in the first quarter
Comp stores were positive across all geographic regions and the sales by month was generally consistent throughout the quarter
From a merchandise standpoint, the sales growth was broad-based, with most of our major product categories experiencing positive comp store sales
Once again, the livestock and pet category led our comp performance and we continued to experience solid demand for many of our basic everyday items
Comparable store transaction count increased 2.2% or approximately 2.8%, adjusting for the one less sales day
This compares to prior year's reported 1.5% increase, or 2.7% adjusted for the week shift
Comparable store transaction count increased across all regions of the country and was driven by strength in our C
items
Both average comp ticket and big ticket sales were flat to prior year
Product resets and new assortment offerings helped sales of certain big ticket products such as chicken coops, generators and grills, but these sales were offset by softness in other seasonal categories
Outdoor power equipment sales were soft in the back half of the quarter, but cooler temperatures and greater moisture has extended the spring selling season, and we've seen an improvement in the outdoor power equipment category in the early part of third quarter
Deflation impacted average ticket by approximately 30 basis points
As a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those stores will be included in the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now, turning to gross margin, which decreased 10 basis points to 34.9% compared to a 30-basis-point decrease in the prior year
Product margin was essentially flat to prior year with no significant impact from mix or rate
We were pleased with the merchandising team's ability to maintain gross margin rate with a balanced pricing approach that incorporates both market share and margin-driving strategies
Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories, higher average fuel costs, and to a lesser extent, growth in our online business
Petsense provided a slight benefit to gross margin, as these stores operate at a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores
For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 50 basis points to 22.1% of sales, compared to 21.6% of sales in the prior quarter
The SG&A growth principally reflects our investment in a few key strategic areas, a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience, also, our investments in technology to grow our digital capabilities, and then, Petsense which operates at a higher SG&A rate
Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% compared to 36.8% last year
The increase in the rate principally reflects lower state tax incentive credits compared to the prior year
Now, turning to the balance sheet
At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $68 million and $454 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $151 million and $196 million in outstanding debt last year
During the second quarter, we acquired 2.2 million shares for $134 million through our stock repurchase program
Year-to-date, we have acquired a total of 3.8 million shares for $248 million
The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 6.5% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average
Exclusive of Petsense, average inventory levels per store increased 1.1% compared to a 1.2% decrease in last year's second quarter
We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter, as well as the management of our working capital
Given the seasonal nature of some of our product categories, we evaluate our business based on the performance of the halves and not just the quarters
With this in mind, let me make a few brief comments on our first half performance
Consolidated net sales grew 7.9%, and we had positive comp sales of 0.2% for the first half versus an adjusted increase of 1.7% last year
Comparable store transaction count increased 0.5% for the first half compared to an adjusted 2.7% in the prior year
While sales and gross margin trends improved in the second quarter, our first half results were below our expectations, with the majority of the shortfall from the first quarter
Now, with respect to our outlook
Based on the trends and results of the first half of the year, we've revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2017. We expect full year sales to range from $7.13 billion to $7.19 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1.1% and 1.7% and net income to range from $413 million to $419 million and earnings per diluted share to be $3.22 to $3.27. Assumed in this guidance is an operating margin decline of 80 to 100 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% to 36.9%, average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 128.2 million to 128.8 million and capital expenditures of $250 million to $270 million
We estimate deflation will impact full year same-store sales by approximately 30 basis points, which includes the second half forecast of approximately 20 basis points impact
Our revised comparable store sales outlook assumes a comp estimate of 2.0% to 3.0% in the second half of the year
Based on our Q2 trends and early third quarter momentum, we are keeping our comp store sales assumptions for the back half generally consistent with our original plan
As a reminder, the third quarter is cycling an adjusted negative 1.1% comparable store sales from the third quarter of last year and the fourth quarter is cycling a prior year positive 3.8% comparable store sales result
While our timing of new store openings is slightly behind our original forecast, we expect to hit our 100-store target and continue to be pleased with the new store productivity
For the year, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly down due to the decline it experienced in the first half
Thus, we are estimating a slight improvement in gross margin during the back half
With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points this year
Factors to consider are: first, higher payroll expense to drive strong customer service levels in our stores along with cycling favorable medical and workers' compensation related costs in the prior year are key contributors to the deleveraging of expenses in the back half of the year
Additionally, depreciation expense is expected to grow 16% to 17% over the prior year, resulting from our key strategic investments in technology, our LED lighting retrofit program and supply chain enhancements
Additionally, Petsense will have an unfavorable impact on SG&A leverage for the full year
Also, let remind you that the prior year's second half SG&A benefited from strong expense control, a reduction in incentive compensation, and favorable medical and workers' compensation expenses
Additionally, the 53rd week benefited last year's second half and full year expense leverage, and also added approximately $0.055 per diluted share
Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 36.7% to 36.9%, as we do not expect to see tax benefit in the current year from the new accounting rules related to the recognition of the tax benefit on stock options exercised
That concludes our prepared remarks
Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Sure, Seth (sic) [Simeon], this is Kurt
Couple of things in there as I mentioned on the gross margin side, there's a slightly less benefit in the back half than our original forecast was on the gross margin side
And then, on the expense side of it, there's the additional spend, as Greg mentioned, on the store payroll
We see a lot of strong feedback and benefit from great customer service in stores
So there's additional store investment on the back half as well
And then, you mentioned the third thing
The back half of the year has some strong compares in the 53rd week, as well as some of the cost savings and favorable benefit we got from certain insurance reserves, such as medical and workers' comp in the back half last year
Sure
A couple of things on there, Seth (sic) [Simeon]
I'd say that the biggest factor on the gross margin side is that we do see freight headwinds persisting in the second half as we do in the first half
And then, the difference that we see on the gross margin side is that we do see some momentum from the gross margin improvement that we saw in second quarter and we anticipate that those trends will continue in the second half
And we see that those will be some of the tailwinds that we've got on it
The expense side are the things I just mentioned in the first part of your question
Sure, Peter
A couple of things
What we saw in the second quarter that was different is we did see a momentum change in the first part of the second quarter all the way to the backend strength in some of our pricing initiatives as well as the exclusive brands
Our assumptions for the back half, we see opportunity and growth on the gross margin with additional exclusive brand products and growth there, as well as continuing on the pricing side the momentum that we saw in the second quarter
Peter, first on the CapEx, the most significant difference is the Northeast distribution center capital spend that was in the original plan
There was a decrease and that's the most significant factor on the CapEx and it's a timing issue
The timing of the spend has shifted out of 2017 into 2018. Most of the other parts of the spend are relatively consistent, maybe a slight reduction on new stores and slight reduction on IT
As far as the capital spend side, we look at the back half as operating cash flow fairly consistent with last year and I would anticipate our debt to be in the $500 million to $550 million range by the end of the year, and that's pretty consistent in line with our targets of a 2.0 leverage ratio
Christopher, this is Kurt, I'll start and I'll just say that our assumptions baked into our revised guidance for the back half assumes more normalized weather there
I'll just start with that, in that, last year, we had a slow start to the fall winter season and sluggish September as well as October, November, we're soft, and then, as you referred to the December
We see a more normalized year between Q3 and Q4 as the main factor that we baked into our guidance
Christopher, it's Kurt
First, on the new stores, as I mentioned, we're excited about new store productivity
Our new stores are continuing to be part of our growth strategy, in that, they're driving the comp sales as well as the bottom line profit
Our new stores typically are profitable in year one
So yes, we see in 2018 and beyond where our targets of approximately 100 stores, it's a good fit for our internal resource structure
We can grow those 100 stores with a lot of the existing support and good opportunity for Tractor Supply out there
Other investments, we anticipate our capital spend would be somewhat consistent in the near future years to what you're seeing in 2017. And I would say yes, the investments on the technology side, logistic supply chain to drive and support our key initiatives, we're expecting those in the near term as well
But we'll be cycling that type of level as that investment is baked into the operating margin today
But yes, we've got years where we're going to continue to drive support on the digital and the logistics side
Michael (sic) [Brian], this is Kurt
I mean a couple of things and we've talked about these, but we've not seen the return of the tailwinds on the inflation
So at this point, as I mentioned, the back half of 2017 we anticipate continued deflation
Those years where you saw the benefit of the inflation, we don't have those yet and we don't have signs that those return in 2018 at this point
The oil markets have stabilized, moderated a bit, and so that's a positive in regards to how Texas, Oklahoma, are performing
But we're not at a point where those type of conditions are tailwinds for us
So those would be some things that we certainly would be looking for to get to a higher comp rate
Sure, Scott, this is Kurt
I would start with saying that we don't get too far into beyond the current year, maybe a little bit the near term
I would tell you that for the near term that we would expect the investments that we referred to as on the expense side, to have some of those continue to exist
On the gross margin side of the product, we continue to balance the different levers that we've got on rate, mix and driving market share
So I'd say the short-term, there's pretty much consistency between 2017 and, say, 2018. Beyond that, I think it's too far out reaching to try to give additional guidance at this point
Dan, this is Kurt
I would tell you that some of the investments that we talked about in 2017 that will exist in 2018. Near term, operating margin may be more flat and you're close on, if we're reaching out and looking ahead, it would be at least 2019 perhaps to start to see some operating margin growth
But even that far out, it's hard to – and don't want to try to give any sort of guidance beyond that
Dan, this is Kurt
So I think I understand the question
Just maybe clarify the reference to 1% versus 2.2%
Is the 1% you're referring to last year?
Right, right, right
Yes, so
We use the 1.1% last year as the base up against that 2.2% reported number
Sure, Adam, this is Kurt
First, let me – I'll address the depreciation question
Depreciation grew in the first half about 19%
And as we look ahead, I think the key thing is there's a distinct difference in regards to cycling or not cycling yet Petsense
So you've got growth in that number in Petsense included this year and not
And when you factor that out, the gap is a little bit different
We're estimating about a 16%, 17% growth rate in depreciation for the year, and we'll start to cycle Petsense in the fourth quarter
And so, the second half of the year will have a little bit more investment that half last year than the first half
So the compares are a little bit closer
So you'll probably be at about a 15% to 16% depreciation growth rate in the second half of the year
Biggest difference in the comparables is really the Petsense with, yes, some additional investment in our strategic initiatives
But the size of that, the gap, is not an indicator of the impact of the initiatives that we're talking about
They're driving 200 or 300 basis points maybe in growth rate of depreciation in the year
And we'll see the growth rate next year probably in the high single-digit range, a little bit ahead of the sales growth rate, but we'll continue to manage the levers that we've got to address the spend in there and keep the growth rate as close in line to the sales growth as possible
Stephen, this is Kurt
I just want to reiterate, we did not emphasize a seasonal shift from first quarter to second quarter
We indicated at the end of first quarter that we certainly saw softness in demand in the seasonal product, and there was about $15 million of variance perhaps in March year-over-year
We did not see enough indication in regards to timing that we were indicating in anything that there was a seasonal shift
I would say the only shift might be the timing of Easter, and what we expected from pre-Easter in prior year first quarter to second quarter shifted pretty consistently, but that was in our plan
No
At this moment, it wouldn't be accurate for me to get into that
I mean, until we get through the entire season, we won't really have a good read on it
Good afternoon
Sure
When we baked in assumptions and looked at the first half and created the guidance for the year adjustments on our guidance, as we mentioned, top-line comp sales fairly consistent
There is some reduced new store sales due to the timing of the opening of new stores
But when you see on the expense side, a couple key things in regards to the back half
We certainly benefit from expense reduction and some favorable items last year
Do factor in the 53rd week as I mentioned
And we have more cautiousness in the revised guidance on gross margin rate versus the 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point improvement in the original guidance
There are – additionally on the tax rate, I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that the tax rate has increased 50 basis points
I do want to point that out that we do not expect to get the 50-basis-point benefit that we had in the original plan, due to the lack of stock option activity
So when you factor those results in as well as the trends on SG&A in the first half, I think you can get more to the 80-basis-point to 100-basis-point deleverage on SG&A in the back half for the year
Eric, if I could ask you to repeat that
It was fading out and I did not get much of the question
Okay
Sure, this is Kurt
I would just tell you without a lot of specifics, while the first half missed on both the top-line and bottom line, most of that was in the first quarter, but I would also say that second quarter, the top-line sales results while good, there was also both top and bottom line slight miss on the second quarter as well
And then, I do want to remind you with the – there are non-comp new store selling weeks that were baked into our original guidance that we had to adjust based on timing of new stores
Sure, Joe, this is Kurt
First, we can walk you through the adjustments from our original plan
I would tell you that the key factors, again, are the gross margin rate is softer than the original plan while a slight benefit
On the expense side, yes, we are going to invest on the second half additional payroll
The incentive comp is a strong headwind to go up against
We called it out last year that incentive comp was a benefit, and then, after that, it's just some of the other expense management that we had
Those are the items that differ between the original 60 basis points to 80 basis points deleverage on SG&A to more of an 80 basis points to 100 basis points
