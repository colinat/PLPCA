46,accelerated this quarter with strength in mass continuing interest in Korean beauty trends and the recent addition of three major new brands Proactiv and Shiseido and Origins contributing strong growth as they ramp up in the assortment
47,The power of social media influencers are driving particular strength in prestige skincare brands like Mario Badescu and Peter Thomas Roth
48,"Our own Ulta Beauty collection performed very well in the quarter, benefiting from upgrades to in-store presentation, formulations and packaging all rolled out earlier in the year and from new product positions in popular holiday kit"
49,Looking ahead we are excited to announce today a new partnership with the Estee Lauder Companies
50,We'll be launching their MAC brand online in early May and will begin to rollout MAC to stores starting in June and continuing throughout the year
51,We plan to reach more than 100 stores in 2017 including the majority of new stores opening in the second half of the year
52,MAC is the number one prestige makeup brand in the U.S
53,and one of the strongest brands in America
54,"MAC has along their one of our guest more reflected brands in its addition to our assortment helped us reach and better serve audiences that are important to us including Teams, Millennial and diverse customers"
55,The highlight is strong positioning as a makeup artistry brand we plan to offer MAC makeup services at all stores in which we rollout the brand
56,The service components of the MAC offering is yet another example of how we're able to enhance and differentiate the shopping experience and drive traffic to our stores
57,"Turning to the services business, salon sales increased 15.2% and comps 8.8% with strength in hair color and makeup services"
58,Color services got a boost from the launch of Redken pH-Bonder a color additive that better protects the integrity of the hair during color services

63,Our Benefit Brow boutiques continue their strong performance with brow services now available in about 850 stores
64,"Benefit Brow bars complemented their services business with product newness, including exciting product launches in the lip and eye shadow categories"
65,"Now turning to store growth, our growth and development team wrapped up a very busy year opening 25 stores in the fourth quarter to end the year with 974 stores"
66,New store productivity remains very strong
67,We've recruited all the real estate sites for our 2017 store program including a handful of stores that are not in our typical suburban locations in which we'll require more capital and higher rents
68,"These include our new store in Michigan Avenue in Chicago opened this summer, our first store in Manhattan planned for the fall and the store in the Mall of America in Minnesota"
69,Moving to our e-commerce business
70,"com sales grew 63.4% on top of 44.2% growth last year, contributing 380 basis points to our total company comps"
71,This revenue growth was driven almost entirely by increased transactions
72,"While total traffic growth was up almost 63% mobile traffic rose more than 90%, driven by growth in digital marketing paid channels including search, affiliates, display and Facebook"
73,"com's product mix continues to mirror that of our stores with strong interest in newness and trials demonstrated by the ongoing success of our online only Beauty Break and Beauty Fads, that give our guests compelling sampling opportunities"
74,"So this was the first year that our hand supply chain capabilities allowed us to confidently go through the holiday season without travelling demand on this site, enabling sales growth well above planned"
75,The profitability of our e-commerce business improved as a result of our more efficient fulfillment capabilities as well as the more effective promotional strategy
76,"Finally, Iâ€™d like to update you on our supply chain operations and investments"
77,Our supply chain team performed very well during the quarter and the team did a great job keeping up with the higher than expected demand both in-stores and online to keep in-stock levels high throughout the quarter and in particular during the holiday selling period

81,We expect to ramp the Greenwood DC to serve both the 300 stores and the Dallas DC to serve a little over 200 stores by the end of 2017.
82,"We recently signed a lease for our West Coast distribution center in Fresno California, which we plan to open in the summer of 2018."
83,This sixth DC will be a copy of the Dallas facility and is designed to substantially improve delivery times to the West Coast
84,"From a systems perspective, our new forecasting replenishment system SWIFT performed as plan during the holiday period, as a result we saw higher in-stock and increased productivity of our inventory in the fourth quarter"
85,We also successfully implemented our new floor planning and assortment optimization tool allowing for a more analytical rigor around our assortment decision
86,"And finally we continue to invest in foundational capabilities like our product information management system, newly deployed to all of our suppliers"
87,This capability streamlines the catcher of our active product information directly from our brand partners
88,We are making good progress and we will continue to leverage these investments to improve operational performance and the guest experience
89,This wraps up my review of the quarter
90,In sum our excellent fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to our best year yet
91,Our performance puts us in a unique position in the beauty industry and within the broader retail landscape to take advantage of the many opportunities before us to invest to drive the business for the long-term
92,"And now Iâ€™ll turn it over to Scott, to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter result and our outlook for the first quarter and all of 2017."
93,"Thank you, Omar"
94,We tried to be prudent I guess and really reasonable with the guidance that we give on every dimension
95,We see obviously the core that weâ€™re in; weâ€™ve guided the 9%-11% for the quarter
96,We feel confident about the strength and whatâ€™s happening in the business our ability to understand the dynamics and the levers that we have to continue to drive the results in a healthy long-term way
97,So I would just say that really there is no change to the long-term guidance
98,we always said that it would be stronger in the beginning and sort of moderate a bit out in the out years
99,So the 7% to 9% is the longer term and as we guided 8% to 10% for this year we feel just itâ€™s very much in our line of side and feel very confident about being able to deliver that
100,Thank you
101,Yeah I will talk about these in sort of just overall terms
102,"First of all let me reiterate weâ€™re thrilled about the launch of MAC, weâ€™re thrilled about the progress weâ€™re making across the box in terms of brands and newness and innovation"
103,Thereâ€™s a hundreds of boutiques that with brand expansions that will happen this year
104,We talked about that in the script I'm not going to break that out in specific deal or the productivity
105,"What I would say again weâ€™ve referenced it so that upfront there are some investments in terms of getting a brand up and going and these fixtures are a little bit more expensive, but they drive incremental sales and profit"
106,And also in the long-term excellent for a brand in terms of really reinforcing Ulta Beauty as a great destination for all things beauty
107,So we feel very good about that current status
108,We would be very enthusiastic to teach more about the enthusiasm
109,But honestly Iâ€™ll ask Dave Kimbell to add
110,", I just want to stay thatâ€™s actually one of the core reasons and one of the core foundations that why we feel very confident about our long-term prospects is our understanding of the segment, the size of the segment and the momentum"
111,So I let Dave take it from here
112,"Thank you Dana, the three point question"
113,"We show you enthusiasm about the launch MAC and weâ€™re not going to specific about, weâ€™re just getting started right"
114,so starting online and weâ€™re going to launch it to a little over 100 stores this year
115,And itâ€™s really important brand products to have and weâ€™re confident itâ€™s going
116,add to the mix very nicely
117,and our guess will be very excited about it
118,Your second question wasâ€¦
119,"Online, you mean the margin, right"
120,"So, I will do this weâ€™re very focused on improving the profitability of online business as weâ€™ve talked about today"
121,The big part of our supply chain investment is around fulfilling the online orders in a way that better for our gust in terms of speed and also more efficient in terms of cost
122,"But we expect this to improve, but we expect that the four walls margins are always going to be higher than the online margin"
123,"On the flip side, so the margins getting stronger, but the great thing is itâ€™s a very incremental business to us, right"
124,"So, we study this closely, we look at very closely at consumer at our guest trends and"
125,the guest whoâ€™re shopping online
126,"only this is a small number of people itâ€™s really about guest who are shopping in-store and online and that guests who is involved across both channels is really driving 2.5 times more sales really, itâ€™s not somebody who is just buying in-store"
127,"So, even if that margin is I think in some ways inherently going to be somewhat lower than bricks and mortar, itâ€™s a very incremental business to us"
128,Feeds very much into the dynamic that Dave was describing about how the beauty enthusiasts shop
129,"Yes, we certainly are doing the best we can thinking about the cost of rollout of brands and Iâ€™d"
130,say thatâ€™s inherently assumed
131,We feel confident about the ability; weâ€™re maintaining the goal of reaching that 15 margin target by the end of 2019.
132,And - but being really I think very smart and prudent about how we get there balancing short and long-term and since Scott talked about it
133,well there
134,now we adapt to new investment long-term in this business and we are definitely going to do that
135,"Because we know weâ€™ve got - we need to have the right brands, the right in-store experience and the capabilities to support that"
136,"So, whether or not that top-line could be stronger with some of these brand launches, I donâ€"
137,™t know we try to be really as prudent as we can with our guidance
138,But weâ€™d like to see how it goes before we call it higher that we think we need to
139,"Yes, so let me take some of that"
140,", maybe I'll start, Dave you want to add"
141,"I will say this is a bit of a secret sauce, so I'm not going to get very specific about lot of it, because we're really proud about how the royalty program is working"
142,And as you know the loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales
143,So obviously thatâ€™s part and parcel of the comp growth
144,I mean
145,thatâ€™s kind of the way to think of it
146,"Comp is driven by a lot of components, but the sales are coming from our loyalty members"
147,"We've done a few things, one is obviously"
148,we just converted a couple of years ago to one loyalty program weâ€™ve simplified it
149,we make it
150,"- I think our communication about how the program works, how we communicate with that guest, and how we convert new member, potential members in-store are all kind of components of what we've done thatâ€™s making work well"
151,"And I'll let Dave to add more color, but I would just add also what's exciting to me"
152,"is I am not going to drive that rate of growth of new members forever right, because weâ€™re kind of early the program"
153,"But we still really only have 20% of the beauty enthusiasts as we define them, shopping it also in the U.S"
154,There is plenty of more loyalty perspective members out there
155,"And also even the postcard earner program, we certainly don't have 100% of their share of beauty spend and they're not even buying every category that we offer today"
156,So we see these as all levers to continue to pull at the top-line -
157,at the top level to help drive to continue to support the kind of comp growth that we are guiding
158,And maybe Dave just add a couple of more points about what was done with the program
159,Yeah let me start with that one
160,So to Manhattan specifically
161,and I guess the other urban sites that we're going forward with this year by and large
162,we expect the same kind of financial results
163,"I would say Manhattan is a special case, I mean so back to Dave's earlier point about we're putting our standard prototype store in there right itâ€™s 10,000 square feet and thatâ€™s an expensive proposition on anywhere on the Island"
164,We went to a place where we felt most comfortable kind of a neighborhood feel there with a lot of traffic; I know we got to do subway station right here in our front door
165,"So we're trying to make smart decision as far as the location is concerned that would be a case where we would take something less than our internal hurdle rate, which is way north of 20% right in most of our stores that we open perform way in excess of our internal hurdle rate"
166,And in case of Manhattan we're still expecting to recoup investment returns well above our cost to capital thatâ€™s there that would be another measure that would be significantly lower than 20%
167,So we feel very comfortable that this is a wise decision
168,and it's going to produce great returns for us
169,Yeah
170,and there is no purchasing of MAC real estate or anything like that
171,You asked that question at the end just to clear now this just investment in our store
172,No
173,"I mean we again, we are giving guide - there is a range of outcomes right, thatâ€™s"
174,you are looking at a continuum
175,And so we feel comfortable that between having flexibility on the upside to do better with promotion tactics
176,I mentioned earlier other benefits coming out of supply chain investment maybe quicker than we had originally sought
177,And just other stronger retail trends that drive a lot of leverage on fixed store cost so a combination of those things
178,And as we look at the range we feel very comfortable that we can stick to our target
179,The promotional environment was that weâ€™re too early taking
180,I guess the best way to think about it is that we compete across a lot of dimensions
181,So I mean we compete with
182,"I like to say 70,000 places in any given day that you can buy beauty, because we offer all the product categories and price points"
183,"So department stores are certainly one source, but we also compete with mass with drug, online retailers"
184,So itâ€™s really kind of across the board
185,"Promotional environment I guess for us,"
186,"what I feel good about it, that we the quarter that we had with consistent levels of promotion a year ago I think is a really good way think about the underlying health of our business and that we have - weâ€™re always going to make sure that we are providing a great value to our guest"
187,"And so there is always going to be some levels of coupons or promotions in-store, but certainly our loyalty programs allow us to get that much more focused and targeted"
188,and we have been doing that over the last few years
189,"So I feel like we have got good control of our levers, so we got levers that we use as we need them and more importantly weâ€™re really just in an environment where beauty is certainly the growing category itâ€™s very active"
190,there is a lot of players nobody is doing exactly what we do
191,So we really try to just play our offence and thatâ€™s why we are talking about really continuing to investment in the long-term of our business because obviously beauty enthusiast is holding with their dollars
192,"We are not complacent, we are not perfect, so we know we just have to stand top of our game"
193,And then the Ulta Beauty collection
194,"I think we break it out, itâ€™s between 3%, 4% of the business similar online in-store, which is true for most of our, but actually I am really proud about our little Ulta Beauty collection growth rate"
195,I mean Dave talked about this the mass side of our business is very important to our guest and our private label brand
196,"weâ€™ve really, really double down in making that a stronger brand that we had"
197,So part of the investments in-store had to do with making sure that weâ€™re using fixtures and showcasing that brand and to best possible light
198,"We have invested in - we have redone the packaging, we are really bringing newness to that that line much more rapidly and itâ€™s doing very, very well"
199,So I donâ€™t if there is a cap
200,"certainly I like it, itâ€™s"
201,a great margin and our guest will response our guest
202,is wonderful the constrained would be we are not going to be too big in anything
203,I mean we want this to be a mosaic brands that our guest want and love
204,Having said that we know itâ€™s going to be bigger will be bigger and we have a fair amount of space dedicate and we can make that space even more productive overtime
205,and we will
206,So weâ€™re proud about whatâ€™s happening with Ulta Beauty collection
207,Thank you
208,Thank you
209,I just want to reiterate we're really proud about the year that we had in 2016.
210,"And I really like to thank our 32,000 associates for delivering that year and all their efforts to continue to drive our success in 2017 and beyond"
211,I appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with everybody soon
