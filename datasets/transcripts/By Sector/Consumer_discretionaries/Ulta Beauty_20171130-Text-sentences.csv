95,The Pro Team is already making a big impact and getting a lot of attention in the salon world with extensive coverage in industry publications like Modern Salon and Behind the Chair

99,We were able to open almost all of our 100 net new stores in our 2017 program before Black Friday weekend to take advantage of holiday traffic in sales

117,Simply Sona and exclusive to Ulta Beauty; and Milani makeup and primers

119,"com also delivered excellent results with our signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty, The Gorgeous Hair Event, as well as online-only promotions, including platinum Perks, Beauty Sample Bag of purchase and limited-time Beauty Breaks"
120,We launched Shoppable Instagram in August and weâ€™re seeing growing interest and engagement in this platform
121,Now turning to the development of our omni-channel capabilities
122,"Last quarter, weâ€™ve mentioned our store-to-door test in 40 stores, which enabled guests to place ulta"
123,com orders in-store and have products delivered to their homes
124,We rolled out this capability chain wide at the end of the third quarter
125,"And while this initiative is still fairly small in terms of demand, itâ€™s proving quite useful and satisfying guests looking for hot brands that are not available in every store, such as MAC or Morphe"
126,The number of omni-channel shoppers continues to steadily increase
127,"Guests purchasing both in-store and online now represent 9.1% of our loyalty members compared to 7.5% a year ago, and sheâ€™s spending 21.7 times more than a retail-only guest when she shops in both channels, including doubling her spend in our stores"
128,"And finally, to update you on our supply chain operations"

133,"From the speed-to-guest perspective, the supply chain team has achieved a 20% reduction in retail replenishment lead times with most of our e-commerce orders processed within 24 hours of an order being placed"
134,"We also â€“ weâ€™ve also continued to implement technologies to provide greater control and visibility, supporting ongoing efforts to improve service and reduce costs"
135,Our DC network has continued to mature with the ramp of our new DC operating model in Greenwood and Dallas
136,These two facilities are expected to process nearly 85% of our e-commerce volume during the peak 2017 holiday season
137,"As we prepare to go live with the Fresno DC next summer, weâ€™ll continue to see more e-com demand to fill out of our new DC operating model"
138,"And speaking of Fresno, construction of our new West Coast distribution center is nearly complete and hiring of the management team is well underway and weâ€™re on track to open next summer"
139,"The Fresno DC will add another 670,000 square feet of capacity back in service up to 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day"
140,Fresno will also provide a platform to implement new technologies to increase productivity and significantly reduce transit time for our West Coast customers
141,"From an inventory perspective, weâ€™ve been building our DC in-store inventory levels to prepare for the significant volume spike that we anticipate during the holiday season"
142,"The team has done a great job maintaining high in-stock levels and while they remain above goal, weâ€™ve also focused on achieving our inventory turn goals"
143,"Inventory per door grew by 6.5%, well below our total sales comp of 10.3% in the third quarter, a solid achievement in light of the additional safety stock we built in support of our fourth quarter sales projections"
144,Iâ€™m also really proud of the partnership among the supply chain teams through operations and merchandising teams to ensure the seamless execution of our many new brand launches and category reflows
145,That completes my progress report on our strategic imperatives
146,"Looking ahead to the rest of the year, weâ€™re looking forward to an exciting fourth quarter, as our teams work together to inspire our 26 million loyal guests to treat themselves and their friends and families this holiday season"
147,"Our merchants have planned a great assortment with lots of newness and exclusives, our marketing team is executing and compelling 360-degree plan around our Bring to Beauty Theme, including new creative for television and radio"
148,"Our store teams are ensuring strong execution of the planograms and events, and weâ€™re investing in labor hours to give great guest service and our supply chain and system teams are supporting the stores on ulta"
149,"com with improved inventory planning, leading to higher in-stock levels, we are ready"
150,"And with that, Iâ€™ll turn it over Scott to discuss in more detail our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the current quarter"
151,"Well, first of all, I would say that that one of the great things about the Ulta Beauty business model is that we participate the All Things Beauty, All in One Place line is real"
152,"So we participate across all the major beauty categories, which gives us a lot of ability to drive growth in share gains and flux with category cycles"
153,"So I would say, first of all, we take a really macro kind of long-term view in the sense, thereâ€™s many categories within the big beauty category"
154,and there are cycles that happen
155,"One thing Iâ€™ll just say is that, I come back to skincare in a minute"
156,But guests are just as engaged as ever in makeup
157,"And so if you just look at whatâ€™s happening on YouTube, or Instagram, or our own followers across channel, if you look at the trends that we see in demographics, the beauty enthusiast segment of the future Millennials, Latinas, teens"
158,all over index particularly in makeup
159,"So we feel confident that the involvement and engagement in makeup and somewhat softer current performances is fairly, itâ€™s not a long-term trend"
160,"Itâ€™s about innovation, lapping over some really big kinds of innovation platforms the last couple of years"
161,"We also saw not only strong growth, but really strong share gains continue for us in makeup"
162,"Now, as you said whatâ€™s kind of cool is that weâ€™ve seen some acceleration in some of the categories"
163,"So in particular, in fragrance and skincare, both accelerated in terms of growth in our share gain, and we think that has long-term life to it as well"
164,"Skincare, itâ€™s really been driven by a lot of innovation and Dave can add more color to this"
165,"But some interesting innovation, what I call, faster, funner ways to do skincare like masks or more interesting efficacious ingredients from Korea"
166,"And so thatâ€™s interesting, and we think thatâ€™s good"
167,It has no reason to continue to not be strong profitable prestige and mass
168,"So we see a lot of innovation coming down the pike, Iâ€™d say, across all categories for us as we look out into fourth quarter 2018."
169,"Well, I would say, first of all, we love the fact that our e-commerce growth is picking up"
170,"And as Scott said, I think very well, weâ€™re agnostic about it from a bottom line profit perspective, but weâ€™re actually really positive about it as it relates to customer engagement"
171,"So the folks that are like 9% of our loyalty members that are on the channel, multi-channel right now by far our best guests in terms of spending almost three times the amount of somebody whoâ€™s only shopping in store, but she is also shopping even more in-store than before"
172,So we talked about this a lot
173,"Itâ€™s not a shift, itâ€™s not a channel shift"
174,"Itâ€™s actually an expansion of us getting more per share wallet, so thatâ€™s all great"
175,"Now, of course, weâ€™re always thinking about our physical footprint in build out and thatâ€™s something that weâ€™re very rigorous and disciplined about"
176,We have no reason to change that target right now
177,"Thereâ€™s a range for a reason, because itâ€™s range"
178,"Yes, I donâ€"
179,™t think thereâ€™s any one point in time
180,But to me the best thing is that every year our store fleet continues to perform better than a year before
181,So 2017 historically is ahead of budget and IRR target and we continue to see it strengthen
182,"So I guess, the best way to think about it is, we actually know that when we build stores, the e-commerce business also grows with it, so they actually are complimentary not stealing from each other"
183,And so we have no reason to think that dynamic will change
184,"And we of course, are very disciplined about our real estate decisions"
185,But we would keep that targeted range where itâ€™s right now
186,"As you know, Iâ€™ll let Dave take this since he is the closest to it"
187,"And Iâ€™ll just add too that, weâ€™re also actively participating with thereâ€™s a lot of social media influencer brands that are hot"
188,"And so, we talked about this a little bit, but Morphe, Dose of Colors, Lime Crime, these are brands that were born more through social media"
189,But also many of these brands most understand that the benefit of sort of merging the digital and physical is important for their guest and for our guest as well
190,"And so weâ€™re seeing some nice growth with those brands, too"
191,"Thank you, Adrienne"
192,So Iâ€™ll start with your first question
193,"I guess, stepping back this is really, I mean, we really are playing the long game here"
194,And believe that Ulta Beauty has the most relevant proposition for the beauty enthusiast now into the future
195,"And for us, itâ€™s really about long-term driving more guest gaining more beauty enthusiast into our loyalty programs and also capturing more per share of wallet"
196,So each quarter is a little bit different
197,"But weâ€™re looking to drive not just long-term share gains, but really long-term engagement within our loyalty platform"
198,"And so this quarter was an example of, we did not want to miss the opportunity to continue to â€“ on the momentum"
199,We gained $1.8 million new loyalty members this quarter
200,So I consider that a long-term play not a just a short-term by promotion plan
201,"Now we needed to drive some traffic, because there was some disruption with the hurricanes and some softness in the category"
202,"But for us, thatâ€™s kind of how we think about strategically long-term is how do we continue on the momentum that we have to drive and get an even bigger loyalty program, which really is, I guess, the flywheel to drive our business for the long-term"
203,"Yes, Iâ€™ll start with the second part of your question, and then maybe Dave you can add on the holiday piece, too"
204,"But I would say, that not to be redundant, but Iâ€™m really proud about the fact that weâ€™ve got a business model that has a lot of levers and frankly, flexibility"
205,"And so weâ€™ve worked really hard over the past few years to really reduce our reliance on more broad-based, broad scale just blunt instrument"
206,", I call it, to a much more sophisticated lever, marketing mix that gas allowed us to do a couple of things"
207,"One, a lot is to participate in things that are driving the kind of brand awareness"
208,we have today
209,"I mean, they have 50% unaided brand awareness, right now itâ€™s actually a really big deal"
210,"And so weâ€™ve been able to kind of pull back on broad-based discounting and still maintain a reasonable overall marketing spend by shifting into things that are driving awareness, allowing us to participate in the social channels, where the journey is happening for people running about beauty and then do more demand creation and more targeted fashion right?"
211,So the whole point of the World Food Program is to be as targeted as we can
212,"That in conjunction with exciting brands and assortment and advance and all that right, that all comes together in a great mix that allows us, I think, to be really smart and efficient"
213,"So thereâ€™s signs that we have to flex levers more aggressively than others, and it would be our intention to be less about price discounting and more about targeted promotions and part of what we invest in â€“ are investing in over time as the ability to get even more personalized in everything we do"
214,So thatâ€™s the notion of at a time what weâ€™re using tools to get people into royalty program
215,"That provides long-term benefit, because we know that our ability to target them with really exciting relevant offers that are not really relying on discounting, but just exciting offers will only increase over time"
216,"So, thatâ€™s kind of a long answer to your question, but thatâ€™s the goal to have leverage, have flexibility, but also continue to bias towards more targeted personalization"
217,Thank you
218,"I just like to thank our 36,000 associates for their incredible commitment to serving our guests and delivering operational excellence at a very busy time of the year"
219,And we thank you all for your interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to speaking with all of you soon
