4,"On October 31, we completed the spinoff of the China business"
5,This marked the largest strategic initiative undertaken by Yum!
6,since our spinoff from Pepsi 20 years ago
7,"I'd like to recognize the work, effort, and diligence across the organization that enabled us to complete the spinoff on time and with such success"
8,The spinoff and concurrent return of $6.2 billion to shareholders in 2016 concluded step one in our transformation

10,China team on completing their first quarter as an independent public company
11,"Micky, Ted, and the China team did a great job on their call Tuesday evening"
12,and we congratulate Joey on her promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer
13,"Step two of our transformation centers around executing our multiyear strategy to accelerate growth, reduce volatility and increase capital returns to shareholders"
14,We are taking our franchise ownership to the next level and are on track to increase our franchise mix to at least 98% by the end of 2018.
15,"By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million and improve our efficiency by lowering G&A as a percent of system sales to 1.7%"
16,"In combination, these efforts will not only enable us to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, but improve absolute cash flow at the same time"
17,"I'm really happy to reaffirm the long-term targets we set out at our October investor and analyst conference, and I look forward to sharing highlights with you, as we progress"
18,"Simultaneously, we're strengthening the foundation underlying each of our businesses, changing our mentality to align with our growth transformation and taking the necessary bold actions to position Yum!"
19,Brands for even stronger same-store sales and net new unit growth
20,These are the building blocks of shareholder value creation for a world-class franchisor
21,"We're championing the customer experience like never before, and putting a fierce emphasis on building brands"
22,"The linchpin in all of this, of course, is our focused strategy"
23,"I'm a firm believer in the power of focus and believe that we can deliver long-term, sustainable results by honing in on the key drivers of our business"
24,"Our four growth capabilities define every decision and action we undertake and make no mistake, they are driving our business every single day"
25,"We will win consistently by concentrating on being the best in the world with distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent"
26,I am energized to lead such a talented team that is spearheading tangible change across our organization
27,"As we outlined at our October investor conference, we're building a stronger growth machine and are well on our way towards our bold goal of 7% annual system sales growth"
28,"Now turning to our financial results, across many metrics, Yum! delivered a strong tier 2016."
29,Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% in the year
30,This exceeded both our October 2016 investor and analyst conference guidance and our long-term target of high single-digit annual growth
31,"Now with this in mind, let's review each division's results"
32,"First, KFC, whose consistent global performance is impressive"
33,"The division grew total system sales 7% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth"
34,"In the quarter, same-store sales grew 3% or 6% on a two-year stack and core operating profit grew 15%, including the 53rd week"
35,"Total system sales grew 8% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Continental Europe"
36,"In international developed markets, total system sales grew 6% with strength in Canada, Australia and Continental Europe"
37,I'd like to point out that the U.S
38,"continued its positive momentum, recording its 10th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth"
39,The team deserves a lot of credit for delivering remarkable fourth-quarter comps of plus 4% or plus 7% on a two-year stack despite difficult industry backdrop
40,KFC global strategy to return to the fundamentals across the spectrum is paying off
41,"Our strong pride in the core original recipe is at the center of everything we do and this translates to a focus on the basics in terms of recipe, a well-defined brand positioning, globally based on always original and clear value at memorable price points"
42,Innovation closest to the core is resonating with the consumer
43,Just look at Nashville Hot and the recently launched Georgia Gold
44,"We did not change the form of our product, only the flavor profile and our customers love it"
45,"As we look into 2017 and the future of KFC, I am encouraged by the opportunities we see worldwide"
46,"The brand is focused on convenience, making it easier to access KFC anyplace and in any way"
47,"For example, we are using flexible footprints, which increase the ease of unit development"
48,"With smaller asset types, we can build restaurants in places such as transportation hubs and urban centers"
49,And KFC is also making a big push on the digital front in 2017 with self-ordering kiosks and a mobile site
50,"Finally, the brand is expanding delivery around the world"
51,"Our product has a very shareable occasion and travels incredibly well, which gives us confidence in the upside of this opportunity"
52,"In fact, delivery is the fastest growing channel in the business, and while we offer delivery out of more than 5,000 restaurants today, we plan to expand this even further"
53,"Now turning to Pizza Hut, which grew total system sales 2% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 2% net new unit growth, but offset by a 1% contraction in the same-store sales"
54,"Pizza Hut is a strong global brand, but the U.S"
55,and international are two distinct stories
56,"We're pleased that our international division is laying the groundwork for prolonged growth, and we're particularly invigorated by the team's ability to drive development"
57,Net new units grew 6% in 2016 and we expect continued growth as the development agreements signed last year take hold
58,You have already heard from Yum!
59,"China about its plans, but here are a few other examples"
60,"In 2016, we signed a substantial development agreement for Central and Eastern Europe"
61,"Separately, we signed a master franchise agreement in Australia, where we're excited our new partner opportunistically acquired another pizza chain, shortly thereafter will converge into Pizza Hut over time"
62,"At the same time, we are implementing our repeatable model to spread best practices around the world"
63,"We've developed a strategy where we improve taste, experience and our value proposition all while clarifying our brand message in order to ensure profitable, strong, transaction-driven unit level economics"
64,We are taking our learnings from the success of Thailand where we grew same-store sales at least 20% for three consecutive quarters in 2016 to other markets
65,"Korea, for example, has had several months of improvement"
66,"Malaysia is in the early days of success and others are implementing it, as we speak"
67,"We believe there is a significant opportunity for Pizza Hut International to accelerate top-line and unit growth, and look forward to delivering results consistent with these strategies"
68,"On the other hand, Pizza Hut U.S"
69,", which is roughly 10% of total Yum!"
70,"operating profit, is clearly in turnaround mode"
71,The quarter's results disappointed and are not acceptable
72,We have undertaken an extensive study of the business utilizing outside experts and found a number of areas where we need to improve in order to take our fair share of growth in this market
73,"These areas include improvements in the digital experience, delivery times, point-of-sale system simplification, and asset optimization, among others"
74,"As with all turnarounds, this is a journey we need to undertake hand in hand with our franchise partners and will not be complete in 2017."
75,"We will share specifics of the plan in time as we implement them, but let me be clear, we see the market share opportunity in this category"
76,"We will execute initiatives across all aspects of the customer experience to capture our fair share and more, and I'm certain we have the ability and the determination to accomplish this"
77,We've confronted challenges in all of our brands in the past and always overcome them
78,"Most recently, we executed a successful turnaround of our U.S"
79,"KFC business, so stay tuned as we have more updates while we deliver on our plans"
80,"And finally, Taco Bell delivered a solid 2016 with system sales growth of 6%, including the 53rd week, driven by net new unit growth of 3%, and same-store sales growth of 2%"
81,"Taco Bell continued to outperform the category in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales of 3% or 7% on a two-year stack"
82,"The brand's value-driven, innovation-focused model once again proved its merit"
83,"and I'm pleased with the team's ability to deliver solid results, despite difficult industry conditions"
84,"In the quarter, Taco Bell saw particular success with the $1 all day messaging and the rolled chicken tacos"
85,"As we look to 2017, we're energized by Taco Bell's high/low value strategy and its innovative marketing calendar, including the $1 double stack tacos and the highly-anticipated Naked Chicken Chalupa, which is off to a great start"
86,"On the international front, Taco Bell continues to build momentum"
87,"We opened 53 new restaurants, another record year of development"
88,"We saw strong fourth quarter same-store sales performance in Canada, Spain, and the Philippines"
89,"The brand launched in Brazil with five new stores in only three months and we're thrilled with the consumer enthusiasm for the Taco Bell in China, which recently opened and is off to a great start"
90,"In fact, I'll be visiting this critical market in March and we're already looking for ways to work together with Yum!"
91,China to accelerate the growth of Taco Bell going forward
92,"In closing, I'm excited about the future of Yum!"
93,and the plans we have to unlock shareholder value
94,"KFC and Taco Bell sustained a category defying momentum from December into the new year, which gives me confidence in our 2017 guidance, which David will outline in a few minutes"
95,"Every brand is working to improve the key drivers of our business, same-store sales and net new units"
96,"We are more focused than ever on collaboration, brand building, and translating this to profitable results for the long term"
97,"The path is never linear, but we're relentlessly pursuing our vision of a world with more Yum!"
98,"Now, before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment on behalf of everyone at Yum!"
99,"to express our sympathy for Joe Buckley's family, friends, and colleagues at Bank of America and in the restaurant community"
100,Joe will be sorely missed
101,"With that, David, over to you"
102,"Obviously, our bold goal, David, is 7% system sales growth and as David outlined, we believe we can get to 2% to 3% same-store sales growth next year and 3% development"
103,I think what's very clear is that we are much more focused on these two
104,"So, as I work with the leaders in the organization, I would say we've raised the awareness on the importance of net new unit growth, not just in the U.S"
105,", but outside"
106,"In that context, obviously, we had a very strong year at Taco Bell"
107,"Obviously, at KFC in the U.S"
108,", we've been a net closer"
109,"I believe that by the time we get to the end of 2019, we will be a net builder of new units at KFC, so I think that will be a turnaround"
110,We have signed significant development agreements with Pizza Hut International with a number of franchisees around the world
111,These are in the order of magnitude of 200 to 300 restaurants over like five years
112,"And I think that on the KFC front, our ability to continue to penetrate in emerging markets remains"
113,"So I feel very good about our ability to continually grow our net new unit growth, and I think there's an equal focus on same-store sales growth, getting back to really understanding consumer insights, really getting to what makes the consumer different, and really understanding that what we're delivering is a food experience, not just food"
114,And I think all of that will help us enormously
115,"And so, I feel confident that I think we probably grew system sales around 4% last year"
116,We are tithing at least 5% this year and I think we're definitely on our way to delivering close to the bold goal of 7% by the end of 2019.
117,"Yes, and to answer the second question"
118,"I think there's really three things, Brian"
119,I think the first one is we are much more focused as an organization
120,"We are absolutely focused on driving same-store sales, net new unit and, obviously, shareholder returns"
121,"I think there's four areas that we are more focused in building distinct and relevant brands, obviously, enhancing our franchise capability, this bold asset development and unrivaled culture and talent"
122,"And internally, even as we did the 2017 AOP, it was very clear across all the divisions that they are more focused on these four things, which we believe will ultimately lead to stronger system sales growth"
123,"I think the second thing is, we're running the organizations really through what I call a global leadership team"
124,"So, it's not just the Yum! executive team, but we meet monthly as a global leadership team, which is obviously the division CEOs and Presidents"
125,"And I think the last meeting, which we had two weeks ago, they remain incredibly confident and optimistic about both 2017, as well as hitting all the three-year transformation plans"
126,"And then the last one is, we're going to have our first global leadership conference in five years in about a month"
127,This will be bringing the top 200 leaders of the organization together
128,"And essentially, the core of this meeting is about how do we go from good to great?"
129,How do we go from growing 5% system sales and get to 7%?
130,And my objective is to use those 200 leaders to essentially be co-authors of this growth because we are going to have to do things differently
131,We are going to have to be bolder
132,and I want them to co-author that sort of how
133,I know they are excited about it
134,"and I believe that we will leave with everyone having absolutely clear clarity on what we are doing on the focus that we are changing, and I think, hopefully bolder and"
135,"more courageous decisions that will get us from sort of 4% to 5% system sales growth to the 7% number, which our bold goal"
136,"So let me just say, I think we did deliver 6% net new unit growth in Pizza Hut International last year"
137,"and I know the team because of the development agreements we've already signed,"
138,"very, very confident that we continue to grow net new units in the Pizza Hut world"
139,"There are some very good examples, as you mentioned, about what we are calling the repeatable model"
140,"So in Thailand, we've turned that business around"
141,I think we've delivered at least 18% sales growth for three quarters in a row
142,"We've obviously captured what we've done there, and as I alluded in my remarks, taking that to Korea and Malaysia"
143,I'm excited about the master franchise agreement that we've done in Australia
144,The results in Australia have improved markedly
145,I happened to meet with the master franchisee when I was there in December
146,I'm very impressed
147,"and I think that you will see both stronger same-store sales growth, as well as, as I said in my remarks, the opportunistic ability to acquire another pizza company and transform those assets into Pizza Hut"
148,"So on the international side, I feel very good that we have captured the repeatable model, the things that work, and that we have an accelerating net new unit model in place"
149,In the U.S
150,", I think it's very clear"
151,"In fact, the way I look at it, I go back to what is the underpinning of why Taco Bell had a pretty successful 10-year run and what is it that helped us turn around the U.S"
152,KFC business?
153,I think it's really two things
154,It's the partnership and relationship we have with the franchisees and that then leading to an aligned long-term strategy
155,"And so, I think"
156,if you
157,â€
158,"“ if I look at Taco Bell, I think our relationship with our franchisees is world-class and that enables us not to be in a week-to-week, month-to-month planning cycle, but to be really looking at the long-term and have great sort of trajection"
159,"I think, as I said on the KFC U.S"
160,"turnaround, I think Jason Marker, and the team, they changed the relationship with the franchisees, and on the basis of that change in relationship, we've now got a much more long-term sort of strategic alignment"
161,"On the Pizza Hut side, I think the good news is I know that both the franchisees and us want to replicate the results of both Taco Bell and KFC"
162,I think both sides recognize that we need to improve the relationship and out of that relationship will become hopefully a more long-term aligned strategy
163,"So, while there are many things to do at Pizza Hut, as we have talked about, there's assets"
164,", there's technology, there's operating systems, there's communication"
165,"I think fundamentally, when we get ourselves into an aligned long-term strategy that executes the plan, we know we've got a plan, then I believe we'll start to see an improvement in Pizza Hut"
166,So I remain positive that we can do this
167,We know what's got to get done
168,and I do believe our franchise partners at Pizza Hut want to be successful just as much as we do
169,"Yes, well, obviously, the Pizza Hut business is a delivery business and I think in the U.S"
170,", well, through delivery and carry out, more than 90% of the sales come from that now"
171,So the other thing I'm really excited about is Roger's commitment to take KFC and make it more of a global delivery brand
172,"As I said in the prepared remarks, we are already in 5,000 stores doing delivery"
173,"Obviously, we have over 20,000 KFCs"
174,The great thing about KFC is it is perfectly set up to be delivered
175,"There is nothing better than a bucket of Original Recipe chicken in terms of a transportation vehicle, product that holds its heat, delivers well"
176,"So, in that sense, I do believe, and"
177,I know Roger believes that accelerating delivery is a key part of it
178,"And on Taco Bell, obviously, Brian has started to roll out Taco Bell delivery"
179,This product isn't as well set up to be delivered as the other two brands
180,"But what is interesting is that when people want this product, they'll have it delivered"
181,I think we're already in about 400 stores in the U.S
182,It's not a huge part of the business at the moment for Taco Bell
183,I know that Brian and the team are committed to accelerating that
184,"Where we do have delivery, particularly around college towns, it can actually be, I think, about 4% or 5% of sales, but still a long way to go"
185,"So, to answer your question, we're focused on it"
186,We really have to turn Pizza Hut into a delivery brand
187,"We're still probably well known as a dine-in brand, but the delivery brand is what we've got to change the consumer's perception"
188,"KFC, we're committed to growing delivery and we have a great product to deliver"
189,"And on Taco Bell, our customers want it; we're just going to work at how we get it to them"
190,"So, the answer is we're very focused on that, and that will be one of the drivers of growth"
191,"Well, on Pizza Hut, hopefully by the end of the year we'll be at a single POS system in the U.S"
192,", which will help enormously"
193,"Internationally, we're looking at getting out of multiple POS systems down maybe one or two, so that will help dramatically"
194,"Taco Bell is almost at a single POS and back-of-house system, which obviously sets them up for eCommerce, digital, social"
195,And KFC is obviously also making progress to get to a more aligned one system
196,"That will help us do things like loyalty, which obviously are critical and important in the marketplace"
197,"It sets us up to obviously drive the social agenda, and I think all of that will lead to improved growth to the business going forward"
198,"I mean I think,"
199,"well, obviously, Pizza Hut's got a very big digital ordering business today, but I think the opportunity for us to do loyalty and things like that will obviously happen once we get to this single POS system"
200,Taco Bell already has mobile apps you can obviously order through
201,"I think that business isn't large yet, but what it does do is actually make the brand a relevant brand"
202,"So, it's one of those things where we may not be getting a lot of business from -eCommerce on Taco Bell"
203,", it does actually reinforce that this is a millennial-centric brand"
204,"And then on KFC, yes, I think it's not going to happen any time soon, but we definitely know we need to be in the loyalty business"
205,"And so, whether it's late this year, next year, that's probably more the timing that things will occur"
206,It obviously is ahead of our run rate
207,"As I think I said earlier, the organization is much more focused on two things, driving same-store sales and delivering net new units"
208,"So, I think just the amount of time we're spending on what do we need to do in order to deliver that growth, as we alluded to, obviously, both KFC and Taco Bell, took that sort of Q4 momentum into Q1."
209,"We've got the launch of Georgia Gold, you've got the launch of Naked Chicken Chalupa, and obviously, we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut"
210,"So, with the plans that we put together for the AOP, I feel really good about the plans across the brands, internationally, and in the U.S"
211,It's nice to go into the quarter with some momentum
212,And I think this focus is really starting to pay off
213,And I'll be even more excited when we come out of the global management meeting
214,and I've got the top 200 leaders to really help us think about what else could we do from a bold and courageous point of view in order to deliver even more same-store sales growth and even more net new unit growth
215,I'm really looking forward to that meeting because there's nothing better than being asked to co-author your own future
216,"So, I feel good about that"
217,"I feel good about the plans that the divisions presented in 2017, and now we've got to go and execute,"
218,which is what we've traditionally been very good at
219,"Well, I think, look, our performance will differ, obviously, across the three brands"
220,"So, in averaging 2% to 3%, I have expectations that maybe one brand will do better and one will do a little less and one will do about that number"
221,"So, I'm not expecting every brand to deliver that"
222,"I think the brands that have got momentum, we can build on that"
223,"And the brand that doesn't have momentum, we've got to do a lot of work"
224,I sat down with the Pizza Hut U.S
225,"We were reviewing calendar changes for this year, which obviously, they're working with the franchise community"
226,"So, no one is sort of sitting still either"
227,"If we are having success, we're trying to build on it"
228,"If we're not having success, we are acting quickly in order to change the trend"
229,I think the easiest answer is no
230,I'm not seeing any impact anywhere
231,"There's obviously a lot of discussion and speculation, but I'm not seeing any impact on our business in any country so far"
232,"I think right now we are, obviously, having a lot of discussions with the U.S"
233,"And I think until there's an outcome, I think,"
234,"as I said earlier, I think the great thing is that the U.S"
235,"Pizza Hut franchisees, as much as we do, want to obviously turn the performance around and be more like KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S"
236,They understand that it's going to require a partnership
237,They understand it's going to require long-term strategic alignment
238,"And I think how that plays out in terms of what both sides do in order to build that relationship and get ourselves strategically aligned, that is sort of, I guess, work in progress"
239,But I am very confident that both sides want to obviously get to a better place and get this brand back into growth
240,"So, thanks, everybody, for being on the call"
241,I guess for me 2016 was a landmark year
242,We successfully spun off Yum!
243,"China, we launched this multi-year transformation plan, and we returned $6.2 billion to shareholders"
244,"I'm very pleased with the results and a solid end to what, I think, was an extraordinary year"
245,"Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% for the year, obviously exceeding our guidance"
246,I remain very confident in our three-year plan
247,"So, there's no change to our long-term guidance"
248,and I'm encouraged by the early progress we're doing to unlock growth through this sort
249,of focused four growth drivers
250,We're off to a running start
251,"I think we can accelerate growth, reduce volatility, and increase capital return to shareholders"
252,"So, I guess in summary, I'm very excited about the future of Yum!"
253,"And I think we represent an extremely compelling growth story and one that investors, I hope, will buy into"
254,"So, thanks for being on the call"
255,Thanks for coming out in the horrible weather
256,and we look forward to speaking to you all very soon
