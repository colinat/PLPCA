Thank you Keith and good morning, everyone
Given the weather that I see in the Northeast this morning, I am pleased that you could join us today as we share with you a review of our results and discuss the future opportunities for Yum! Brands
2016 was truly a landmark year
On October 31, we completed the spinoff of the China business
This marked the largest strategic initiative undertaken by Yum! since our spinoff from Pepsi 20 years ago
I'd like to recognize the work, effort, and diligence across the organization that enabled us to complete the spinoff on time and with such success
The spinoff and concurrent return of $6.2 billion to shareholders in 2016 concluded step one in our transformation
We all want to extend a heartfelt congratulations to the Yum! China team on completing their first quarter as an independent public company
Micky, Ted, and the China team did a great job on their call Tuesday evening and we congratulate Joey on her promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer
Step two of our transformation centers around executing our multiyear strategy to accelerate growth, reduce volatility and increase capital returns to shareholders
We are taking our franchise ownership to the next level and are on track to increase our franchise mix to at least 98% by the end of 2018. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million and improve our efficiency by lowering G&A as a percent of system sales to 1.7%
In combination, these efforts will not only enable us to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, but improve absolute cash flow at the same time
I'm really happy to reaffirm the long-term targets we set out at our October investor and analyst conference, and I look forward to sharing highlights with you, as we progress
Simultaneously, we're strengthening the foundation underlying each of our businesses, changing our mentality to align with our growth transformation and taking the necessary bold actions to position Yum! Brands for even stronger same-store sales and net new unit growth
These are the building blocks of shareholder value creation for a world-class franchisor
We're championing the customer experience like never before, and putting a fierce emphasis on building brands
The linchpin in all of this, of course, is our focused strategy
I'm a firm believer in the power of focus and believe that we can deliver long-term, sustainable results by honing in on the key drivers of our business
Our four growth capabilities define every decision and action we undertake and make no mistake, they are driving our business every single day
We will win consistently by concentrating on being the best in the world with distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent
I am energized to lead such a talented team that is spearheading tangible change across our organization
As we outlined at our October investor conference, we're building a stronger growth machine and are well on our way towards our bold goal of 7% annual system sales growth
Now turning to our financial results, across many metrics, Yum! delivered a strong tier 2016. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% in the year
This exceeded both our October 2016 investor and analyst conference guidance and our long-term target of high single-digit annual growth
Now with this in mind, let's review each division's results
First, KFC, whose consistent global performance is impressive
The division grew total system sales 7% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth
In the quarter, same-store sales grew 3% or 6% on a two-year stack and core operating profit grew 15%, including the 53rd week
Total system sales grew 8% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Continental Europe
In international developed markets, total system sales grew 6% with strength in Canada, Australia and Continental Europe
I'd like to point out that the U.S
continued its positive momentum, recording its 10th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth
The team deserves a lot of credit for delivering remarkable fourth-quarter comps of plus 4% or plus 7% on a two-year stack despite difficult industry backdrop
KFC global strategy to return to the fundamentals across the spectrum is paying off
Our strong pride in the core original recipe is at the center of everything we do and this translates to a focus on the basics in terms of recipe, a well-defined brand positioning, globally based on always original and clear value at memorable price points
Innovation closest to the core is resonating with the consumer
Just look at Nashville Hot and the recently launched Georgia Gold
We did not change the form of our product, only the flavor profile and our customers love it
As we look into 2017 and the future of KFC, I am encouraged by the opportunities we see worldwide
The brand is focused on convenience, making it easier to access KFC anyplace and in any way
For example, we are using flexible footprints, which increase the ease of unit development
With smaller asset types, we can build restaurants in places such as transportation hubs and urban centers
And KFC is also making a big push on the digital front in 2017 with self-ordering kiosks and a mobile site
Finally, the brand is expanding delivery around the world
Our product has a very shareable occasion and travels incredibly well, which gives us confidence in the upside of this opportunity
In fact, delivery is the fastest growing channel in the business, and while we offer delivery out of more than 5,000 restaurants today, we plan to expand this even further
Now turning to Pizza Hut, which grew total system sales 2% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 2% net new unit growth, but offset by a 1% contraction in the same-store sales
Pizza Hut is a strong global brand, but the U.S
and international are two distinct stories
We're pleased that our international division is laying the groundwork for prolonged growth, and we're particularly invigorated by the team's ability to drive development
Net new units grew 6% in 2016 and we expect continued growth as the development agreements signed last year take hold
You have already heard from Yum! China about its plans, but here are a few other examples
In 2016, we signed a substantial development agreement for Central and Eastern Europe
Separately, we signed a master franchise agreement in Australia, where we're excited our new partner opportunistically acquired another pizza chain, shortly thereafter will converge into Pizza Hut over time
At the same time, we are implementing our repeatable model to spread best practices around the world
We've developed a strategy where we improve taste, experience and our value proposition all while clarifying our brand message in order to ensure profitable, strong, transaction-driven unit level economics
We are taking our learnings from the success of Thailand where we grew same-store sales at least 20% for three consecutive quarters in 2016 to other markets
Korea, for example, has had several months of improvement
Malaysia is in the early days of success and others are implementing it, as we speak
We believe there is a significant opportunity for Pizza Hut International to accelerate top-line and unit growth, and look forward to delivering results consistent with these strategies
On the other hand, Pizza Hut U.S
, which is roughly 10% of total Yum! operating profit, is clearly in turnaround mode
The quarter's results disappointed and are not acceptable
We have undertaken an extensive study of the business utilizing outside experts and found a number of areas where we need to improve in order to take our fair share of growth in this market
These areas include improvements in the digital experience, delivery times, point-of-sale system simplification, and asset optimization, among others
As with all turnarounds, this is a journey we need to undertake hand in hand with our franchise partners and will not be complete in 2017. We will share specifics of the plan in time as we implement them, but let me be clear, we see the market share opportunity in this category
We will execute initiatives across all aspects of the customer experience to capture our fair share and more, and I'm certain we have the ability and the determination to accomplish this
We've confronted challenges in all of our brands in the past and always overcome them
Most recently, we executed a successful turnaround of our U.S
KFC business, so stay tuned as we have more updates while we deliver on our plans
And finally, Taco Bell delivered a solid 2016 with system sales growth of 6%, including the 53rd week, driven by net new unit growth of 3%, and same-store sales growth of 2%
Taco Bell continued to outperform the category in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales of 3% or 7% on a two-year stack
The brand's value-driven, innovation-focused model once again proved its merit and I'm pleased with the team's ability to deliver solid results, despite difficult industry conditions
In the quarter, Taco Bell saw particular success with the $1 all day messaging and the rolled chicken tacos
As we look to 2017, we're energized by Taco Bell's high/low value strategy and its innovative marketing calendar, including the $1 double stack tacos and the highly-anticipated Naked Chicken Chalupa, which is off to a great start
On the international front, Taco Bell continues to build momentum
We opened 53 new restaurants, another record year of development
We saw strong fourth quarter same-store sales performance in Canada, Spain, and the Philippines
The brand launched in Brazil with five new stores in only three months and we're thrilled with the consumer enthusiasm for the Taco Bell in China, which recently opened and is off to a great start
In fact, I'll be visiting this critical market in March and we're already looking for ways to work together with Yum! China to accelerate the growth of Taco Bell going forward
In closing, I'm excited about the future of Yum! and the plans we have to unlock shareholder value
KFC and Taco Bell sustained a category defying momentum from December into the new year, which gives me confidence in our 2017 guidance, which David will outline in a few minutes
Every brand is working to improve the key drivers of our business, same-store sales and net new units
We are more focused than ever on collaboration, brand building, and translating this to profitable results for the long term
The path is never linear, but we're relentlessly pursuing our vision of a world with more Yum!
Now, before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment on behalf of everyone at Yum! to express our sympathy for Joe Buckley's family, friends, and colleagues at Bank of America and in the restaurant community
Joe will be sorely missed
With that, David, over to you
Obviously, our bold goal, David, is 7% system sales growth and as David outlined, we believe we can get to 2% to 3% same-store sales growth next year and 3% development
I think what's very clear is that we are much more focused on these two
So, as I work with the leaders in the organization, I would say we've raised the awareness on the importance of net new unit growth, not just in the U.S
, but outside
In that context, obviously, we had a very strong year at Taco Bell
Obviously, at KFC in the U.S
, we've been a net closer
I believe that by the time we get to the end of 2019, we will be a net builder of new units at KFC, so I think that will be a turnaround
We have signed significant development agreements with Pizza Hut International with a number of franchisees around the world
These are in the order of magnitude of 200 to 300 restaurants over like five years
And I think that on the KFC front, our ability to continue to penetrate in emerging markets remains
So I feel very good about our ability to continually grow our net new unit growth, and I think there's an equal focus on same-store sales growth, getting back to really understanding consumer insights, really getting to what makes the consumer different, and really understanding that what we're delivering is a food experience, not just food
And I think all of that will help us enormously
And so, I feel confident that I think we probably grew system sales around 4% last year
We are tithing at least 5% this year and I think we're definitely on our way to delivering close to the bold goal of 7% by the end of 2019.
Yes, and to answer the second question
I think there's really three things, Brian
I think the first one is we are much more focused as an organization
We are absolutely focused on driving same-store sales, net new unit and, obviously, shareholder returns
I think there's four areas that we are more focused in building distinct and relevant brands, obviously, enhancing our franchise capability, this bold asset development and unrivaled culture and talent
And internally, even as we did the 2017 AOP, it was very clear across all the divisions that they are more focused on these four things, which we believe will ultimately lead to stronger system sales growth
I think the second thing is, we're running the organizations really through what I call a global leadership team
So, it's not just the Yum! executive team, but we meet monthly as a global leadership team, which is obviously the division CEOs and Presidents
And I think the last meeting, which we had two weeks ago, they remain incredibly confident and optimistic about both 2017, as well as hitting all the three-year transformation plans
And then the last one is, we're going to have our first global leadership conference in five years in about a month
This will be bringing the top 200 leaders of the organization together
And essentially, the core of this meeting is about how do we go from good to great? How do we go from growing 5% system sales and get to 7%? And my objective is to use those 200 leaders to essentially be co-authors of this growth because we are going to have to do things differently
We are going to have to be bolder and I want them to co-author that sort of how
I know they are excited about it and I believe that we will leave with everyone having absolutely clear clarity on what we are doing on the focus that we are changing, and I think, hopefully bolder and more courageous decisions that will get us from sort of 4% to 5% system sales growth to the 7% number, which our bold goal
So let me just say, I think we did deliver 6% net new unit growth in Pizza Hut International last year and I know the team because of the development agreements we've already signed, very, very confident that we continue to grow net new units in the Pizza Hut world
There are some very good examples, as you mentioned, about what we are calling the repeatable model
So in Thailand, we've turned that business around
I think we've delivered at least 18% sales growth for three quarters in a row
We've obviously captured what we've done there, and as I alluded in my remarks, taking that to Korea and Malaysia
I'm excited about the master franchise agreement that we've done in Australia
The results in Australia have improved markedly
I happened to meet with the master franchisee when I was there in December
I'm very impressed and I think that you will see both stronger same-store sales growth, as well as, as I said in my remarks, the opportunistic ability to acquire another pizza company and transform those assets into Pizza Hut
So on the international side, I feel very good that we have captured the repeatable model, the things that work, and that we have an accelerating net new unit model in place
In the U.S
, I think it's very clear
In fact, the way I look at it, I go back to what is the underpinning of why Taco Bell had a pretty successful 10-year run and what is it that helped us turn around the U.S
KFC business? I think it's really two things
It's the partnership and relationship we have with the franchisees and that then leading to an aligned long-term strategy
And so, I think if you – if I look at Taco Bell, I think our relationship with our franchisees is world-class and that enables us not to be in a week-to-week, month-to-month planning cycle, but to be really looking at the long-term and have great sort of trajection
I think, as I said on the KFC U.S
turnaround, I think Jason Marker, and the team, they changed the relationship with the franchisees, and on the basis of that change in relationship, we've now got a much more long-term sort of strategic alignment
On the Pizza Hut side, I think the good news is I know that both the franchisees and us want to replicate the results of both Taco Bell and KFC
I think both sides recognize that we need to improve the relationship and out of that relationship will become hopefully a more long-term aligned strategy
So, while there are many things to do at Pizza Hut, as we have talked about, there's assets, there's technology, there's operating systems, there's communication
I think fundamentally, when we get ourselves into an aligned long-term strategy that executes the plan, we know we've got a plan, then I believe we'll start to see an improvement in Pizza Hut
So I remain positive that we can do this
We know what's got to get done and I do believe our franchise partners at Pizza Hut want to be successful just as much as we do
Yes, well, obviously, the Pizza Hut business is a delivery business and I think in the U.S
, well, through delivery and carry out, more than 90% of the sales come from that now
So the other thing I'm really excited about is Roger's commitment to take KFC and make it more of a global delivery brand
As I said in the prepared remarks, we are already in 5,000 stores doing delivery
Obviously, we have over 20,000 KFCs
The great thing about KFC is it is perfectly set up to be delivered
There is nothing better than a bucket of Original Recipe chicken in terms of a transportation vehicle, product that holds its heat, delivers well
So, in that sense, I do believe, and I know Roger believes that accelerating delivery is a key part of it
And on Taco Bell, obviously, Brian has started to roll out Taco Bell delivery
This product isn't as well set up to be delivered as the other two brands
But what is interesting is that when people want this product, they'll have it delivered
I think we're already in about 400 stores in the U.S
It's not a huge part of the business at the moment for Taco Bell
I know that Brian and the team are committed to accelerating that
Where we do have delivery, particularly around college towns, it can actually be, I think, about 4% or 5% of sales, but still a long way to go
So, to answer your question, we're focused on it
We really have to turn Pizza Hut into a delivery brand
We're still probably well known as a dine-in brand, but the delivery brand is what we've got to change the consumer's perception
KFC, we're committed to growing delivery and we have a great product to deliver
And on Taco Bell, our customers want it; we're just going to work at how we get it to them
So, the answer is we're very focused on that, and that will be one of the drivers of growth
Well, on Pizza Hut, hopefully by the end of the year we'll be at a single POS system in the U.S
, which will help enormously
Internationally, we're looking at getting out of multiple POS systems down maybe one or two, so that will help dramatically
Taco Bell is almost at a single POS and back-of-house system, which obviously sets them up for eCommerce, digital, social
And KFC is obviously also making progress to get to a more aligned one system
That will help us do things like loyalty, which obviously are critical and important in the marketplace
It sets us up to obviously drive the social agenda, and I think all of that will lead to improved growth to the business going forward
I mean I think, well, obviously, Pizza Hut's got a very big digital ordering business today, but I think the opportunity for us to do loyalty and things like that will obviously happen once we get to this single POS system
Taco Bell already has mobile apps you can obviously order through
I think that business isn't large yet, but what it does do is actually make the brand a relevant brand
So, it's one of those things where we may not be getting a lot of business from -eCommerce on Taco Bell, it does actually reinforce that this is a millennial-centric brand
And then on KFC, yes, I think it's not going to happen any time soon, but we definitely know we need to be in the loyalty business
And so, whether it's late this year, next year, that's probably more the timing that things will occur
It obviously is ahead of our run rate
As I think I said earlier, the organization is much more focused on two things, driving same-store sales and delivering net new units
So, I think just the amount of time we're spending on what do we need to do in order to deliver that growth, as we alluded to, obviously, both KFC and Taco Bell, took that sort of Q4 momentum into Q1. We've got the launch of Georgia Gold, you've got the launch of Naked Chicken Chalupa, and obviously, we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut
So, with the plans that we put together for the AOP, I feel really good about the plans across the brands, internationally, and in the U.S
It's nice to go into the quarter with some momentum
And I think this focus is really starting to pay off
And I'll be even more excited when we come out of the global management meeting and I've got the top 200 leaders to really help us think about what else could we do from a bold and courageous point of view in order to deliver even more same-store sales growth and even more net new unit growth
I'm really looking forward to that meeting because there's nothing better than being asked to co-author your own future
So, I feel good about that
I feel good about the plans that the divisions presented in 2017, and now we've got to go and execute, which is what we've traditionally been very good at
Well, I think, look, our performance will differ, obviously, across the three brands
So, in averaging 2% to 3%, I have expectations that maybe one brand will do better and one will do a little less and one will do about that number
So, I'm not expecting every brand to deliver that
I think the brands that have got momentum, we can build on that
And the brand that doesn't have momentum, we've got to do a lot of work
I sat down with the Pizza Hut U.S
We were reviewing calendar changes for this year, which obviously, they're working with the franchise community
So, no one is sort of sitting still either
If we are having success, we're trying to build on it
If we're not having success, we are acting quickly in order to change the trend
I think the easiest answer is no
I'm not seeing any impact anywhere
There's obviously a lot of discussion and speculation, but I'm not seeing any impact on our business in any country so far
I think right now we are, obviously, having a lot of discussions with the U.S
And I think until there's an outcome, I think, as I said earlier, I think the great thing is that the U.S
Pizza Hut franchisees, as much as we do, want to obviously turn the performance around and be more like KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S
They understand that it's going to require a partnership
They understand it's going to require long-term strategic alignment
And I think how that plays out in terms of what both sides do in order to build that relationship and get ourselves strategically aligned, that is sort of, I guess, work in progress
But I am very confident that both sides want to obviously get to a better place and get this brand back into growth
So, thanks, everybody, for being on the call
I guess for me 2016 was a landmark year
We successfully spun off Yum! China, we launched this multi-year transformation plan, and we returned $6.2 billion to shareholders
I'm very pleased with the results and a solid end to what, I think, was an extraordinary year
Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% for the year, obviously exceeding our guidance
I remain very confident in our three-year plan
So, there's no change to our long-term guidance and I'm encouraged by the early progress we're doing to unlock growth through this sort of focused four growth drivers
We're off to a running start
I think we can accelerate growth, reduce volatility, and increase capital return to shareholders
So, I guess in summary, I'm very excited about the future of Yum! And I think we represent an extremely compelling growth story and one that investors, I hope, will buy into
So, thanks for being on the call
Thanks for coming out in the horrible weather and we look forward to speaking to you all very soon
