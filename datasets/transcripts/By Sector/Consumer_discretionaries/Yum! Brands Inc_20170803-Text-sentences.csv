8,"Now to our four key growth drivers, which are at the forefront of every decision at Yum!"
9,I will talk to you about unrivaled culture and talent and our distinctive relevant brand
10,Then David will discuss unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development
11,"First, unrivaled culture and talent, Yum!'s greatest asset for driving results"
12,"This year, I'm continuing my commitment to championing our culture and talent not only with our own employees but also throughout the franchise system"

14,and I'm excited to see our franchisees embracing these ideas and learning to grow our iconic brand
15,"I can tell you that our people and our franchisees are energized, our transformation agenda is taking hold, and our culture is stronger than ever"
16,"Next, let's talk about how this culture is fueling results in our three distinctive relevant brands, starting with KFC, which is truly a global powerhouse"
17,The brand continues to be Yum!
18,"'s most consistent, largest and fastest growing concept with a presence across 129 countries, providing the scale and diversification for a powerful business model"
19,"Representing approximately 50% of Yum!'s operating profit, KFC has nearly 21,000 units across the globe"

21,"We are proud to highlight that in 18 of our 20 KFC business units across both emerging and developed countries, KFC reported positive same-store system sales this quarter"
22,"the second quarter represented KFC's 12th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at a healthy 2%, or 4% on a two-year stack"
23,The $5 Individual Fill Up and $20 Family Fill Up are at price points that resonate with the consumers and leverage the core menu of finger lickin' good chicken and sides
24,The team has truly embraced the idea of moving from food as fuel to food as an experience
25,"Just look at the Colonel drive-thru robot, the online retail store and the proof that KFC is literally out of this world"
26,Who else has sent a sandwich into space?
27,"As further proof KFC is back atop the cultural conversation, the online retail store, KFC Ltd"
28,", was mentioned in media spanning from the Huffington Post to Golf Digest"
29,"At the end of launch day, 18 of 29 products had sold out"
30,"The standout item was a $20,000 400-year-old meteorite in the shape of a Zinger chicken sandwich, selling within 24 hours with several other interested buyers as the sale was pending"
31,These are truly remarkable events and something no one would have believed possible three years ago
32,"Our KFC international markets, representing nearly 90% of KFC's profits, also performed well, in particular, our Turkey and Australia markets"
33,"In fact, our Australia market delivered 7% same-store sales growth, driven by the launch of frozen beverages and a strong value, such as the $2.50 chips and gravy and 24 nuggets for $10."
34,"Our Turkey market delivered same-store sales growth of 23%, driven by balancing the promotional mix between high-end bucket promotions and low-end offerings along with LTOs, which attracted new customers and grew transaction"
35,"The market is also seeing growth in their delivery business, which grew nearly 35% over the prior year and now represents approximately 30% of sales"
36,"Delivery remains a key growth driver for KFC with $1 billion of sales for the brand as of today and the opportunity to significantly increase this, as additional units and markets begin to offer delivery"
37,"Our largest franchisee, Yum China, acquired a majority stake in an online aggregator platform complementing their already robust delivery business and is an example of one of our markets with a longstanding history of delivery"
38,"In addition, we have new markets testing with both online aggregators and in-house delivery all over the world"
39,"In fact, across the entire Yum! system nearly 20,000 of our restaurants offer delivery which is almost half of our total restaurant"
40,Delivery offers consumers a new occasion at typically higher check averages and by leveraging the power of Yum!
41,"to create repeatable models amongst the markets, this makes delivery a platform with huge growth potential"
42,"Next, to Pizza Hut, which as we have discussed is a tale of two businesses"
43,"business, which represents approximately 10% of Yum!'s operating profit signed the Transformation Agreement in May, demonstrating unity amongst the system and our commitment to a digital delivery centric model"
44,"As a reminder, in return for additional media spend and funding from Yum!'s, the franchisees have committed to honor all-advertised national price points through 2019 and to permanently increase their ongoing contribution to national advertising and digital fees"
45,"An additional benefit of the increased advertising is that the funds will be used towards national advertising, allowing the brand to increase its share of voice as it works to build awareness of its efforts around digital and delivery"
46,The brand remains on track to effectively be on one point-of-sale system by the end of the year which will allow Pizza Hut to drive efficiency in its ability to improve its operations around delivery and speed-to-market on digital implementation
47,"As an example, this week, Pizza Hut announced the launch of their first ever U.S"
48,"loyalty program, Hut Rewards"
49,This program is the only national pizza loyalty program that rewards online guests with points for every dollar spent on food
50,"And as further proof that the brand is working to elevate their delivery-centric strategy, they recently announced the hiring of 14,000 drivers by year-end 2017."
51,"While we do not expect the Transformation Agreement to yield results overnight, we do expect to see improvement over time"
52,"In summary, I'm confident these bold steps will pay big dividends for the Pizza Hut brand over the long-term"
53,"Internationally, Pizza Hut system sales increased 7% with 1% same-store sales growth and 5% net new development"
54,We recently met with 10 of our top global Pizza Hut franchise organizations at our Partner's Council to gain delivery and digital-centric alignment to accelerate growth for the business
55,This group of influential individuals represents some of our largest international markets and over one-third of our total net new units currently committed under development agreements over the next three years
56,"I am encouraged by the excitement these growth-minded leaders have for Pizza Hut, carrying an enthusiasm for the brand we haven't seen in a long time"
57,"In addition to this, our UK business recently rolled out Pizza Hut Digital Ventures, an in-house model for digital technology that allows for consumer-led and fast-paced decisions"
58,"Through continued testing and real-time iterating, Pizza Hut Digital Ventures is transforming the Pizza Hut UK website into an easier, faster and better experience for our customers"
59,"Thanks to this agile capability and the improved site functionality, we are seeing increased conversion rates, which drive digital sales growth"
60,"Finally, the repeatable model for value and taste we have previously discussed is lapping its successful rollout and the sales turnaround we saw in key countries like Malaysia and Korea continued in Q2."
61,"All in, the international team is hard at work and we are excited about these results and the long-term growth prospects for Pizza Hut"
62,"Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, posted another strong quarter of same-store sales growth coming in at 4% with 1% of that coming from transaction growth"
63,"We remain confident in delivering another strong year of results by committing to the strategy, encompassing value and innovation with Mexican-inspired product such as the $1.49 Loaded Taco Burrito you saw this quarter"
64,"As I alluded to during the prior quarter, we introduced an additional Naked product with the Naked Chicken Chips, a creative twist allowing us to expand on our chicken platform"
65,I know the Taco Bell team enjoyed meeting everyone and highlighting their growth story at the Analyst Day in May
66,and I hope you appreciated hearing their story and got a good taste of their world-class products and innovation
67,"As further evidence that Taco Bell continues to be a distinctive and relevant brand, news from Taco Bell saying, ""I do,"" to weddings at the Las Vegas store appeared in top tier national food and lifestyle outlets"
68,"Since the initial wedding announcement in February, coverage of this campaign has created 1.7 billion impressions for the brand"
69,Our customers now have a new and unique way to show their love for each other and this iconic brand
70,"Additionally, last week, Taco Bell announced a partnership with Lyft to launch Taco Mode"
71,"For the first time, Lyft has created an integration within their app that enables consumers to ride through a Taco Bell on the way to their final destination"
72,The ride is designed to be as much an experience as the end benefit of capping a night with Taco Bell cravings
73,This partnership highlights the forward thinking at Taco Bell to provide access to our customers in new ways enabled by technology
74,Weddings and Taco Mode are just a few examples of the cultivation of the brand into consumers' lifestyles
75,"Internationally, we also continue to accelerate our presence of Taco Bell"
76,"During the quarter, Taco Bell opened 15 international units in 7 countries"
77,"In particular, in our four key growth markets of Brazil, India, China and Canada, the team opened 6 units bringing our total unit count in those countries to 54."
78,We are very excited to have opened our first standalone unit in Canada in nearly 20 years
79,This restaurant is hugely popular on social media with 98% positive sentiment and plans to start serving beer soon
80,"In India, the team has defined a category of one positioning by offering a differentiated customer experience through elevated assets, table service and unique product offerings like hard shakes that have unlocked opportunities for accelerated expansion of this brand in this huge potential market"
81,"In summary, aligning Yum!"
82,by brands several years ago highlighted the potential for Taco Bell internationally
83,"And as you can see, the team is working diligently to bring the cult of Taco Bell to everyone across the globe"
84,"In conclusion, Yum!'s three distinctive relevant brands delivered another successful quarter"
85,We are on track to further unlock the potential of Yum!
86,through our bold transformation initiatives and look forward to updating you on our journey
87,"And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs"
88,"We actually shared that with the International Partners Council when we were with them in London probably three weeks ago, and I think there was true excitement about Fast Casual Delco as a global opportunity for Pizza Hut"
89,"I think there's also, as we have been â€"
90,"“ David and I've been around, and I've been in Brazil, UK, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong in the last quarter"
91,I think it's a couple of things
92,"One is the small box concept is definitely taking â€“ getting traction, and that small box is allowing us to penetrate places like in Africa, into places we would not have been able to traditionally penetrate with our existing sort of asset base"
93,"And then, I think, Cantina â€"
94,"“ I was up in Chicago the other day, one of our franchisees in Chicago"
95,He has one opened in Wicker Park and he showed me where he's going to open another four or five
96,There's no trade-off with any of our existing Taco Bell stuff
97,"So I think the whole opportunity for us to get into small box Cantinas, urbanizes the brand will help us drive net new units"
98,"Sorry, your questions â€"
99,“ you're breaking up
100,"I mean, if you think about it, we've been closing KFC U.S"
101,"stores for a number of years, for quite a number of years"
102,"Hopefully, with the now 12th consecutive quarter of performance at KFC, there will be some change there as well"
103,"I think, as David said, the development agreements sort of go with refranchising"
104,"So as the refranchising occurs, the development agreements kick in"
105,"And then obviously these new units, small box new formats Cantinas, the 38-square-meter we saw in Brazil, I think all of these provide us opportunities to penetrate and continue to grow our net new unit"
106,"Well, I think there's obvious markets like China where we'll continue to see a lot of new unit growth"
107,"I think as we said, Taco Bell focusing on four big markets, China, India, Brazil, and Canada"
108,"As we said, we've opened our first freestanding drive-thru in Canada, the second one is under construction"
109,"In that one market, we think we can open six or seven"
110,franchisees for Taco Bell now sort of doing development in Canada
111,They're now doing development in Korea
112,"So I think that where we've seen growth, which will be Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, we've got a lot of these locked into long-term development agreements"
113,"As David and I said, we were with the Pizza Hut franchisees last week"
114,Have a new franchisee for Pizza Hut in Japan
115,"Very impressed that he has got a real growth mindset, and I think we can accelerate opportunities in Japan as well"
116,So I see it on that side
117,"On delivery, as we said in the prepared remarks, about 20,000 restaurants currently deliver"
118,"Obviously mostly Pizza Huts, but a large number of KFCs and obviously Taco Bells as well"
119,I do think that delivery is going to grow
120,"We like the benefits of delivery, higher check, incrementality, new users, new occasions"
121,"And I think what we're doing right now is testing in a number of places just user aggregators, doing it ourselves"
122,But I think we all see really a lot of potential growth there
123,"Encouraged by some of the tests that are going on, like a UK test for KFC, where we're actually doing a test with both aggregators and by ourselves"
124,"We're seeing good incrementality, good check growth"
125,So I think even the KFC team believes that adding another $1 billion in sales in the next few years is not without its possibility
126,"And then, Taco Bell, obviously, where we are doing delivery with DoorDash, I think it's now in a 1000 restaurants and it can get bigger as well"
127,"So I think our brands are well established with 20,000 restaurants doing it"
128,We have the expertise of Pizza Hut to help us
129,"I think brands like KFC are ideally set up to be delivered with large buckets, $5 boxes, $10 chicken shares and $20 buckets"
130,It's almost like the Colonel 60 years ago realized one day we'd be delivering this stuff
131,So I think we're in a really good place to take advantage of it
132,"We do think there's growth there for us, and to some extent we're actually â€"
133,"“ KFC China is hosting a delivery summit this month where everyone from around the world will be going to a delivery summit in China so we can learn best practice from them, but also share best practice that we are doing from around the world"
134,So we are all in on delivery
135,"Well, I don't want to get into Q3 in the pizza category, given the competitive nature of it"
136,I think what I can say is we've said it's a slow build
137,"The incremental media didn't happen in the first half, it will happen in the second half"
138,"Obviously, we've just rolled out loyalty"
139,"So I think you will hopefully see a slow build, and we see the results obviously paying off in 2018 and beyond on Pizza Hut"
140,"From a demand environment point of view, I think the great thing about our category is or the great thing about food"
141,is you've got to eat it
142,and I think there will be winners and losers
143,"I think the people that have the most distinct and relevant brands, the people that do the best job of executing operations, the people that open new units and the people who are driven by culture and talent"
144,and that's why they're the four things we are
145,focused on because we believe by focusing on those four things we can be successful in both the U.S
146,and on the global scale
147,"So that's, I think, sort of the way I see the market at the moment"
148,No
149,"I think, I mean, value is always going to be important"
150,So I don't see any renewed focus
151,"I mean, if you think about it, the question is â€"
152,“ I think we've got very good everyday value
153,"At KFC, we have $5, $10, and $20, and that really does resonate"
154,"I think $7.99 at Pizza Hut, I think the $1 and the $5 boxes at Taco Bell"
155,So what I like about the way we're set up is that we've got everyday great value
156,What we don't have to do is to get into this deep discounting and sort of cutting the price on core products which you never want to get into because one day you got to raise those prices
157,So I really like the way the three brands have constructed their value equation in the marketplace
158,I think you see that it's working on the whole
159,And what I appreciate is the franchisees' commitments to staying on those price points so that our customers know day in and day out they can always get not just the best tasting food but the best value in the marketplace
160,I think the answer to that it's like
161,the answer is and
162,We've got to make it easier and better
163,We do believe we have the better pizza; we've got to continue to make sure that we deliver a better pizza in the marketplace
164,But better is also making sure that our piping hot pizza gets delivered to you on time and therefore obviously tastes better
165,"So I think the answer is, just like everything in life, we have to be easy"
166,and we have to be better
167,"So we're working on the easy components whether that's all the technology,"
168,"the digital play whether that's loyalty, and at the same time, we're obviously continuing to work on making sure we have the best pizza in the marketplace"
169,And I think a combination of both of those will see us sort of build the Pizza Hut brand back into the brand
170,we want it to be
171,"I mean, the way I look at Taco Bell is, we are just really enthusiastic about the long-term fundamentals of the business, whether it's the consumer metrics, the ops metrics, the financial metrics"
172,"Obviously, the brand has delivered consistent, healthy same-store sales growth over the long-term"
173,"And I think the icing on the cake, Dave and I happened to spend two days with the FRANMAC group, which is the franchise leadership group for Taco Bell in June, and I think to say they were happy with where the brand is,"
174,happy with where the brand is going and happy with the Taco Bell leadership team would be an understatement
175,So I just feel good about where the brand is going
176,"What happens then quarter by quarter, I think, you will see us continue to deliver"
177,The long-term fundamentals for this business are in great shape
178,Okay
179,So thank you all for being on the call
180,"As we said, we believe we had another successful quarter, 6% system growth, 21% EPS growth, 19% core operating profit growth, and we look forward to updating you as we work the brands as we go through the rest of the year"
181,So thanks for being on the call
