1,"Letâ€™s begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation"
2,"In Q2, we generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.45 of non-GAAP EPS and $517 million of free cash flow"
3,We repurchased $507 million of our stock and this week our Board of Directors approved an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization
4,Moving to active buyers
5,"In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 171 million while trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%"
6,"Underlying the overall trends, we saw stable retention and continued positive momentum in new user acquisition with particular strength coming from the U.S"
7,and Korea
8,"On Slide 6, in Q2, we enabled $21.5 billion of total GMV, up 5%"
9,"By geography, the U.S"
10,"generated $8.8 billion of GMV, up 30%, while international delivered $12.7 billion of GMV, up 7% year-over-year"
11,"Moving to revenue, we generated total net revenues of $2.3 billion up 7% on an FX neutral basis and up 6% organically, both stable versus the prior quarter"
12,"We delivered $1.8 billion of transaction revenue, up 6%, and $511 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 9%"
13,Turning to Slide 8.
14,"Our Marketplace platform grew GMV by 6% in Q2, one point acceleration versus the prior quarter"
15,"GMV accelerated one point quarter over quarter to 5% and international GMV grew at 6%, stable versus the prior quarter"
16,"Underlying those trends, our B2C growth rate was"
17,"6% year-over-year and C2C growth was 3%, both slightly improving versus the prior quarter"
18,"Total Marketplace revenue was $1.9 billion up 7% year-over-year, two point acceleration versus the prior quarter"
19,"Transaction revenue also grew 7% and accelerated two points versus Q1, one point faster than GMV as the pricing changes we announced in Q1, which are enabling increased investments to drive velocity for our sellers went into effect"
20,"Marketing services and other revenue grew 4%, a deceleration of two points versus the prior quarter"
21,"The deceleration was driven by the elimination of certain third party ads on our site in addition to lapping significant Q1 growth from our co-branded credit card revenue, which is recognized annually in the first quarter"
22,"As we continue to shift our advertising strategy away from third party and towards first party advertising, this will favor transaction revenue putting ongoing pressure on MS&O revenue growth"
23,Moving to Slide 9.
24,"StubHub GMV declined 5% year-over-year decelerating 11 points from Q1 while revenue grew 5%, a deceleration of 14 points versus the prior quarter"
25,This quarter we lapped the strongest growth rates from all of last year in addition to facing into a weaker events landscape as Devin discussed earlier
26,"While we will continue to face comps tough comps through most of Q3, we believe Q2 will be the low point of growth for this year"
27,Moving to Slide 10.
28,"In Q2, Classifieds grew revenue 11%, one point acceleration versus Q1."
29,"Weâ€™re seeing strong growth across our key markets driven by improved user traffic and engagement, partially offset by ongoing monetization headwinds as traffic shifts to our mobile app platforms"
30,Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers
31,"In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3%, which is down 180 basis points versus last year, 80 basis points of which was driven by a stronger U.S"
32,dollar impacting all spend categories
33,I will focus my remaining comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses
34,"Cost of revenue increased year-over-year driven by our Ticketbis acquisition, our first party inventory program in Korea and incremental investments in eBay customer support"
35,Q2 sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue as productivity and marketing channels and reallocations across platforms more than offset increased Marketplace brand advertising
36,"In June, we launched a new multichannel brand campaign in the U.S"
37,which will rollout across our key international markets throughout the remainder of the year
38,Product development costs were relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as we are now lapping increased product investments from the second quarter of last year
39,We continue to drive operating leverage to fund ongoing investments in key areas such as the expansion of structured data and the product experience enhancements across our platforms
40,"G&A expenses were up year-over-year driven by the addition of Ticketbis operating expenses and investments in data, security and employee benefits and services"
41,Turning to EPS on Slide 12.
42,"In Q2, we delivered $0.45 of non-GAAP EPS, up 5% versus prior year with FX negatively impacting EPS growth by five points"
43,EPS growth was driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of share repurchases partially offset by the cost dynamics described earlier
44,GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.02 down $0.36 versus last year
45,Our GAAP results were negatively impacted this quarter by a non-cash income tax charge of $311 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset related to the ongoing realignment of our legal structure
46,As always you can find the detail of reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures on our press release and earnings presentation
47,"On Slide 13 in Q2 we generated $517 million of free cash flow, which was down 16% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by timing differences of cash tax payments"
48,CapEx was 8% of revenue in Q2 and we continue to expect to be in the range of 7% to 9% of revenue for the year
49,Turning to Slide 14.
50,"We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $13.6 billion of which $4.9 billion is in the U.S"
51,"Our capital allocation strategy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to enable capital return and drive long-term shareholder value"
52,"In Q2, we raised $2.5 billion of debt, which we plan to use for general corporate purposes, repayment of our near-term debt obligations, share repurchases and M&A activity"
53,"Additionally, we repurchased 15 million shares at an average price of $33.79 per share amounting to $507 million in total"
54,We ended the quarter with $479 million of share repurchase authorization remaining and as I previously mentioned our Board of Directors approved an additional $3 billion authorization this week
55,We remain committed to capital return at a minimum of 50% of free cash flow for the full year and we will continue to be in the market opportunistically at levels above that
56,"Before discussing our Q3 guidance, Iâ€™d like to remind you that we will start to utilize hedge accounting to better protect revenue from currency movements in the second half of 2017."
57,"As I mentioned on our January earnings call, we implemented a new hedging program that is intended to reduce volatility of our top-line from foreign exchange"
58,Going forward are hedging results will be recorded in our net revenue line and not our interest and other line
59,With that letâ€™s turn to our Q3 guidance on Slide 15.
60,We are projecting revenue between $2.35 billion and $2.39 billion representing organic FX neutral growth of 6% to 8% year-over-year
61,Our guidance assumes continued improvement in marketplace volume and revenue growth
62,We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48 per share representing year-over-year growth of 3% to 7% on an as reported basis
63,EPS growth will be driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program offset by continued investments to drive improved user experience and to market our brand
64,"Additionally, we expect FX to impact us by approximately five points of growth on a year-over-year basis"
65,"For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.30 to $0.32."
66,"For the full year, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion, organic FX and revenue growth of 6% to 8%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 29% to 31%, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.98 to $2.03 per share and free cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion"
67,"Assuming foreign exchange rates remain where they are today, we would expect revenue dollars to be slightly above the high-end of our guidance range"
68,We are updating our full-year GAAP EPS guidance to $1.65 to $1.75 per share reflecting the impact of the previously mentioned non-cash income tax charge recorded in Q2.
69,"As our legal structure realignment process continues throughout this year, it may result in further non-cash adjustments that are not currently factored into our GAAP guidance"
70,"In summary, we are seeing positive momentum and we expect to launch an increasing number of product enhancements throughout the remainder of this year in addition to increasing our brand advertising to drive improved consideration in traffic"
71,"As we significantly changed the eBay user experience, the improvement in our results may not always be linear"
72,"However, we believe we are investing in the right initiatives to meet our commitment to accelerate growth"
73,We are on the right track and execution will be key for the second half of this year as we continue to set the business up for longer term success
74,"Now, weâ€™d be happy to answer your questions"
75,Operator?
76,Question-and-Answer Session
77,"No, you covered it"
78,"Yeah, let me work backwards real quick, first off on active buyers"
79,"As Devin called out excluding India we grew active buyers by 5%, which accelerated nearly a point quarter-over-quarter with particular strength in the U.S"
80,and weâ€™d call that also augmented by Korea
81,"Three dynamics under there, some of which weâ€™ve talked about, some of which Iâ€™ll just expand upon"
82,First is retention
83,We continue to see that stable as we exposed more users to our new experiences
84,"New buyers, we see new buyers coming particularly from our new SEO landing pages based on the structured data pages that that underlie that"
85,And weâ€™re starting to activate the brand much more at scale than we have and we expect that to supplement new buyer growth with increased consideration
86,"This is in early phases, but weâ€™re happy with the early start"
87,"If I go back to your first couple questions, first maybe start with guidance"
88,You know as I called out the Q3 organic revenue as well as the total year organic revenue of between 6% and 8% is really going to be based on the acceleration that we expect to see in marketplaces GMV and revenue
89,The pricing change that we made will continue to favor transaction revenue and much of that as I call that my remarks will be reinvested to try and accelerate the pace that we see in our growth
90,What was the other one?
91,Active buyersâ€
92,¦
93,"Yeah, let me double click real quick on Marketplaces GMV"
94,"If you back up here, weâ€™ve accelerated Marketplaces GMV from 4-ish to 5% to 6% over the course of the last year, and this has been driven by the U.S"
95,", which has accelerated roughly one point per quarter over that same time period, while international has been relatively stable"
96,"So weâ€™ve made the most improvement, as Devin called out, to our foundation and as well as changes to the Marketplaces ecosystem in the U.S"
97,"and weâ€™re in the â€“ and weâ€™re further along in the brand activation, as Devin called out, in the U.S"
98,"And those improvements, the changes in the ecosystem, the brand are in the process of rolling out across our platform and our properties internationally"
99,"And so in a global ecosystem, itâ€™s highly dependent on many factors"
100,"But as I said, things wonâ€™t always be linear, but we believe weâ€™re making the right investments and weâ€™re making balanced trade-offs to drive that growth, and our outlook and guidance assumes that"
101,"Yeah, I mean, we talk about Classifieds and eBay as two different platforms because theyâ€™re two different sites"
102,"But the fact of the matter is we go after the same segment, consumer segment, as Devin talked about"
103,"And so increasingly, what youâ€™re seeing in each of the â€“ in some of the major markets is a blending of that inventory to try and make sure that weâ€™re addressing customer needs across to do different sites and platforms"
104,And I think itâ€™s been very successful and itâ€™
105,s always been a go-to-market strategy together in their respective markets
106,"And if you go back to some of the conversations weâ€™ve had in the last few quarters, weâ€™ve invested a lot in structured data and weâ€™ve invested a lot in new experiences"
107,"And I think youâ€™re seeing that pay off in our parts and accessories experience, which is also where weâ€™re seeing nice growth in very differentiated based on the experiences that weâ€™ve developed"
108,"As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if FX rates remain where they are today, then all I was calling out was that the revenue dollars that we report at the end of the year would be at or above, really above the high end of the range"
109,That said the organic FX neutral growth rate of 6% to 8% remains and thatâ€™s driven by the dynamics we just talked about
