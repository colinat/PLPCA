15,"As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag"

25,"Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting"
26,"As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares had been restated"
27,Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release

36,Question-and-Answer Session
37,"Yeah, Chris"
38,"I think that's the proper way to look at it, Chris"
39,"What we quantified was about 100 basis points, the impact of the recall and"
40,"you're right, in the actuals, we were down 70 basis points"
41,"Yeah, as Marty mentioned, we are pretty much done replenishing the out-of-stocks that occurred because of the recall at retail, and we are seeing share recover"
42,"Now, remember, whenever you have that consumer purchasing other products in the marketplace, it takes a bit of time for us to recover the share, but we're seeing promising signs"
43,"Hi, Judy"
44,"As we answered that question at CAGNY, you'll recall, when we provide guidance, we run a range of scenarios that are included in the guidance, and so that'll take into account these types of events, and so we feel the same that we felt at CAGNY"
45,We feel good about guidance and that's why we were able to reaffirm today
46,Thanks for the question
47,"If you recall, when we look at the cigar category, you have it in basically three segments"
48,"You've got the tipped, where Black & Mild participates and has over about 90% of that segment"
49,You have the un-tipped and then you have the non-cigarillo form
50,We participate in the tipped and we have basically a large market share there
51,And so that's why we're running for profitability
52,That's where most of the profitability is in the cigar category
53,"In the un-tipped segment, there's basically a price we're going on where people are competing for volume, but at a very low profitability, and we're really not participating in that segment"
54,"So it hasn't been a change for us, but I think that describes the strategy and the approach we have in the cigar category"
