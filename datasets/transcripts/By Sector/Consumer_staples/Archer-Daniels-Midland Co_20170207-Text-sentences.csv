4,The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32% compared to negative 2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year
5,"Our tax rate was significantly higher this fourth quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings as well as approximately $18 million of discrete tax expenses in 2016 compared to approximately $100 million of discrete tax benefit in 2015, which were a result of portfolio management actions taken in the year-ago quarter"
6,This fourth quarter also includes $18 million of additional tax expense related to truing up the first three quarters of the year to the final year-end 2016 effective rate

10,Our ROIC has started to improve following the challenging operating conditions that we experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016.
11,"On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.73 to the adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share"

13,Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line
14,"Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results"
15,"In all four businesses, we had some small charges related to impairments and restructurings"
16,"In the corporate line, net interest expense was up modestly due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and the issuance of a new fixed-rate debt in August of this year"
17,"Unallocated corporate costs of $132 million were up versus the prior year and slightly higher than the run-rate for previous quarters, primarily due to an approximately $20 million investment in a corporate initiative that created an equivalent offset or reduction to our income tax expense for the quarter"
18,"Minority interest and other includes a $38 million OPEB curtailment gain, related to changes to the U.S"
19,retiree medical program

22,"Acquisitions of $130 million in 2016 include Harvest Innovations, our Moroccan corn processing facility, the Medsofts joint venture and Caterina Foods"
23,"The other investing activities line of cash flow statement includes the incremental investments we made in the Wilmar, less proceeds from divestitures and asset sales, such as our Brazilian sugar ethanol operation"

28,"Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends was $1.7 billion for the year"
29,"Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015."
30,Our balance sheet remains strong
31,Our operating working capital of $7.4 billion was up slightly from the year-ago period
32,Total debt was about $6.9 billion resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $6 billion
33,Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 26%
34,"Our shareholder's equity of $17.2 billion was down slightly from the $17.9 billion level last year, due to returns of capital and changes in the cumulative translation account"
35,We had $5.8 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December
36,"If you add available cash, we had access to $6.7 billion of short-term liquidity"
37,"Before I turn it over to Juan, I'd like to comment on some of the key corporate assumptions for 2017."
38,"We expect net interest expense to average about $80 million per quarter, due to slightly higher interest rates"
39,"Unallocated corporate costs should average about $140 million per quarter, as we invest more in R&D, innovation and business transformation"
40,"We expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 29%, consistent with our normalized rates in recent years"
41,"Share repurchases should be in a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements, which means our average share count for 2017 should be somewhere between the 565 million and 570 million shares"
42,And we're planning capital spending to be in a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion
43,"Next, Juan will take us through a review of business performance"
44,"Good morning, David"
45,"Yes, Heather, it's Ray here"
46,"Yes, indeed we are still talking with different parties regarding these ethanol assets"
47,"We are also looking at some different structures, frankly as we think about tax reform coming in the United States, it does actually open up some different considerations as well in terms of how to structure the transaction because we've been looking effectively at some tax restructures"
48,"And if there is tax reform and if the corporate tax rate does come down, it does open up the avenue for us to look at some other mechanisms in order to look towards monetizing these assets"
49,"And when we talk about approaching $1 billion, we see improvements in sweeteners and starches both in North America as well as international"
50,"We see improvements in the lysine business based on the operational improvements that we have, and we also do see improvements, on price some small improvements in terms of the ethanol, as we talked about earlier"
51,"So when you add it all together, that's the reason why we're fairly constructive about our outlook for the Corn segment in 2017."
52,"I think if you recall, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range is both subject to strategic capital allocation"
53,"So in that respect, to the extent that we find that there are opportunities for us to redeploy capital for our shareholders that makes more sense in terms of a strategic transaction, then we will"
54,"We'll reduce the amount that we buy back, and we'll redeploy that amount towards acquisitions"
55,Remember our capital allocation framework was roughly 30% of the cash flows would go towards CapEx and about 70% will go towards strategic M&A and/or buybacks
56,"So therefore, we are going to follow that framework"
57,"With respect to Wilmar, you've seen us increase steadily our stake in Wilmar"
58,We've been opportunistic about that
59,We've increased our stake and taking advantage of pullbacks in terms of share price
60,We haven't paid consistent with book value
61,"So we've been very careful in terms of how we increase our stake in Wilmar, which we believe is a very important strategic partner and frankly a very important part of our Asia and emerging marketplace"
62,"So at the current level, which is about 23.9%, we feel fairly comfortable"
63,Will we increase further in 2016 (sic) [2017]?
64,It will be a function of whether we believe there's an opportunity for us to pick up the shares at an attractive price
65,"So again, we'll just monitor the market, take a look at our cash flows, take a look at how we're deploying capital, and then make decisions as we move through the course of the year"
66,"You also have to remember that when you talk about strong dollar, you have to talk about what the currency pair is because a lot of people kind of focus on the dollar versus the euro, but when you actually look at versus the Brazilian reais"
67,"or the Argentine peso, a year ago at this call, the reais was trading at BRL 4 to the dollar"
68,Right now it's trading at BRL 3.1.
69,So the reais has actually strengthened
70,"When you take a look at versus the Russian ruble or Ukrainian hryvnia, again crop growing regions, those currencies actually strengthened versus the dollar"
71,So we just have to be careful when we talk about the strength of the dollar
72,"Yes, generally, there's a trend towards a strengthening dollar"
73,"But relative to a lot, the crop-growing regions of the world, over the past 12 months we've actually seen those currencies strengthen relative to the dollar"
74,So I just want to make sure that there's a balanced perspective when we talk about the currency here
75,"I think the biodiesel tax credit, I think we've indicated over the years, it's been roughly around $50 million, plus or minus"
76,And so therefore that's a number that it's in our plan
77,and we believe there is a good chance for the biodiesel tax credit getting renewed
78,"But don't forget,"
79,"I mean, it's very possible that the biodiesel tax credit may get wrapped up in the whole aspect of corporate tax reform as well"
80,"And from our perspective, we believe that any type of corporate tax reform would be positive for ADM, because as you know, in the agricultural sector, being a U.S"
81,"domicile company, we pay the highest tax rates in the industry"
82,"So bringing our statutory tax rates from 35% level to either at the 15% level that Mr. Trump has talked about or the 20% level that Republican Blue Print is talking about is very, very positive"
83,"And then, they've also talked about the border adjustment tax, which for exporters, agricultural exporters like ADM, that would be a positive too for us"
84,"So there is a lot of dynamics when you think about implications of tax reforms, the biodiesel tax credit"
85,"We're all monitoring this very, very carefully, but in general, we feel very positive about the direction that the administration is heading towards looking at improvements to our corporate taxes"
