17,"Unallocated corporate of $132 million was up versus the prior year due to a higher people cost, including benefit accruals as well as our increased investments in innovation, IT and business transformation, yet modestly below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017 that we provided at the last earnings call"
18,"Minority interest and other charges improved to $20 million, primarily due to improved results from our equity investment in CIP"

32,Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%

36,"Next, Juan will take us through a review of business performance"
37,"Good morning, David"
38,"Good morning, Farha"
39,"Farha, if you recall last year, 2016, two major factors dragged down Oilseeds results"
40,"One, the Wilmar equity earnings; and two, the lack of volumes in South America in terms of origination"
41,"Now, those two factors, as we look into 2017, should not be negative factors"
42,And you've seen the strength in terms of the Wilmar equity earnings that translate into our results in the first quarter
43,"And then with the large crop in Brazil, particularly what's expected to be a significantly improved corn crop, origination volumes in South America should be significantly higher, which will contribute towards an overall positive delta in 2017 versus 2016."
44,"So again, we expect 2017 to be a lot better than 2016."
45,"Again, we don't expect it to approach the 2015 levels"
46,"But nevertheless, 2017 for Oilseeds will be a far better year than 2016."
47,"Morning, Eric"
48,I think 1 million tonnes
49,"Yeah, and we are seeing this year an extra 10%, that's as of first quarter growing"
50,"So that's kind of the pace, if you will"
51,"To the extent that it's adding cost, it's adding cost that is included in this $8 to $10 per tonne"
52,"So we shouldn't double-count that extra cost, I will say"
53,So I think you should think about adding earnings from the destination marketing volume that is growing and hopefully picking up something like $6 per tonne versus our original FOB trade
54,"And then you have another source of earnings, which is a slight reduction of structural cost in the global trade desk as we improve our footprint there, as we optimize our footprint there"
55,So those will be basically the two numbers you keep in your head

58,Okay
59,Morning
60,"Good morning, Adam"
61,"Adam, we've reviewed basically the underlying cost of capital model over the past several quarters"
62,"And so, we took a hard look at long-term interest rates, equity risk premiums, betas in our model"
63,"If you recall, when we established the 8% long-term WACC, that was done back in 2012, 2013, and looking back historically over 20 years"
64,"And so, some of those assumptions, frankly, were outdated as we kind of look through these assumptions"
65,", we did some benchmarking"
66,"And so, once we kind of update our model for, like long-term interest rates, recent long-term interest rates, recent equity risk premiums, we determined that it made sense to update the long-term WACC to 7% from 8%"
67,"And a big driver of that was really equity risk premiums, which have come down over time"
68,"In terms of what it means, our long-term objective still remains 200 basis points over long-term WACC"
69,"So, that – the spread has not changed in terms of how we're targeting the organization for results"
70,"In terms of your comment on Ag Services, I mean, naturally, when we set projects and when we look at projects that we're evaluating across all the businesses; there's clearly a spread above even the 200 basis points over the long-term WACC"
71,"So, our hurdle rates remain significantly higher in the double-digit areas"
72,"And we, frankly – we are not going to really adjust those hurdle rates because, we still believe it makes sense to really drive all the businesses to achieve strong earnings and strong returns"
73,"But at least from our perspective, as we kind of think about longer term, what makes sense for our company over a cycle, we do believe like 7%-plus the 200 basis points spread gets you to 9% that over a cycle, we should be achieving about a 9% type of return for this company"
74,"No, we haven't changed our assessment in terms of long-term earnings for the company"
75,"And so from our perspective, we still believe that it is important for us to kind of drive this 200 basis point spread over our long-term cost of capital"
76,"Good morning, Ken"
77,"Yeah, a significant part of the increase in terms of unallocated corporate on the management line is related to our investments in IT, the business transformation and R&D and innovation"
78,We've indicated that these are – we view those as related investments
79,"Although again from a GAAP perspective, we classify that as expense"
80,But it's a fairly significant investment
81,"I mean, as you are going to appreciate, one of our priorities is to improve our business processes"
82,"And so, we launched this program a couple years ago"
83,"And frankly, the run rate of spending as we head into 2017 is actually a fairly significant run rate right now in terms of investments"
84,"And so, I think, Rob, that this is actually a very, very important part in terms of our commitment, our investments, in terms of making this company better, particularly in the area of processes"
85,"In the area of innovation, frankly, for a company our size, we were under spending in terms of R&D and innovation"
86,And I think what we're doing right now is actually devoting the more of our spending in that area
87,"So WILD Flavors acquisition was actually very, very important because from that acquisition, we actually acquired a lot of innovation centers around the world"
88,And that type of expense actually goes into this line called unallocated corporate as well
89,"When you actually take a look at what I call core central staff costs, and when I say core, I mean this is excluding IT, excluding business transformation, excluding R&D"
90,Our core central staff costs actually are still running at what we call the 2012 levels
91,"I mean, if you recall back in 2012, we went through a restructuring of our central staffs"
92,"And so we've actually set our budgets and our cost plans based upon ensuring that our, what I call core central staffs, do not exceed the 2012 levels"
93,"And, so, I think it's important to kind of understand that in what I call like true corporate central staff cost, like the functions themselves, like accounting and HR, et cetera, et cetera, we've actually kept a lid on all those costs, where as we have we actually spent more money in terms what I call investments, particularly in business transformation, R&D and innovation"
94,That's where we've seen the increase in
95,And we think that this is important for this company to make these types of investments at this point in time in order to allow us to be a better company in the future

97,LLC Thanks for the color Ray
98,And the $50 million in run-rate cost savings that you highlight; is that net of this incremental spending in any way or is it just kind of a separate metric?
99,That's separate
100,"I mean, that's really related to our operational excellence initiatives there"
101,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
102,LLC Thank you
