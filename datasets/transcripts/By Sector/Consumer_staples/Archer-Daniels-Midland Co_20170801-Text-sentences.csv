42,"But when you take a look at our run-rate type of savings, right, for 2018, for the things that we can control of the list that – of what Juan announced, there's probably at least about $100 million of run-rate savings that we will be able to benefit in 2018."
43,And that's going to continue into the future there
44,"So, again, we do believe – again, we haven't started our 2018 planning process yet"

57,"Remember, lysine is actually part of the Bioproducts division"
58,And so the – some of the Bioproducts' improvements are actually related -relate to lysine around that particular alliance
59,"So, all in all, Farha, again, I don't have the exact numbers"
60,but I can assure you that a lot of the improvements in sweeteners and starches are actions that we have taken either to grow the portfolio or actually make our cost even more competitive in our processing plants
