1,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call"
2,Today I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and provide my view on our progress across each of our three divisions
3,Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review
4,Let's be real
5,I am not satisfied with our overall sales performance in the quarter
6,"Organic sales declined 2%, with the most prominent declines in Campbell Fresh and V8 shelf-stable beverages"
7,"Additionally, in the Campbell Fresh segment, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to the carrot and carrot ingredient and Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting units"
8,Anthony will walk you through additional details during his comments
9,"There were some bright spots in the quarter, such as growth in U.S"
10,"soup, simple meals, Pepperidge Farm snacks, and fresh soup"
11,"Our adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points, all of which was achieved by Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
12,Another positive result was the over-delivery of our cost-savings initiatives
13,"As we announced this morning, we now expect to achieve our cost-savings target a year ahead of schedule"
14,"Based on the success of the program to-date and the identification of additional savings opportunities, we're raising our cost-savings target from $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018 to $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020."
15,"Looking at the first half, organic sales declined 1%, adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago, and adjusted earnings per share increased 5%"
16,"With the expectation of improved sales performance in the second half of the year, we reaffirmed our full-year guidance this morning"
17,Now let me offer my perspective on the performance of each of our three divisions in the quarter
18,Let's start with the Campbell Fresh division
19,"The CPG segment of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus, dips and chips and fresh soups"
20,The Farms portion of the portfolio includes carrots and carrot ingredients
21,The division's performance was below our expectations this quarter
22,"C-Fresh is an important strategic business for Campbell, and we remain confident in the growth potential of the packaged fresh category, as consumer preferences continue to shift towards fresher and healthier foods"
23,"In fact, nearly 80% of consumers, including younger ones, are trying to eat more fresh foods"
24,"These consumers not only believe that fresh foods are cleaner, healthier and less processed, but that they also taste better"
25,We acquired two packaged fresh businesses: Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet with brands that resonate with consumers as a way to develop a long-term growth platform in packaged fresh CPG
26,The perimeter categories in which we compete are still growing significantly faster than the traditional center-store
27,"While category growth rates have slowed somewhat, we still believe we can build a profitable growth business, leveraging these brands, capabilities, and our scale"
28,"However, our performance over the last year in fresh has been disappointing"
29,"The reasons vary by business, which I'll explain in more detail in a minute"
30,We've made a number of changes to address this
31,"Most notably, we replaced the leadership team and appointed a long-time Campbell executive Ed Carolan as the President of C-Fresh in November"
32,"I'm confident in this new seasoned leadership team, which includes Campbell executives, some newcomers to the company, and key members of the Bolthouse Farms team who possess CPG and agriculture experience as well as insight into both the operations and the entrepreneurial culture of the organization"
33,It's taking longer than we originally expected to regain carrot customers following last year's quality and customer service issues and to rebuild capacity following the Protein PLUS beverage recall
34,"As a result, we no longer expect C-Fresh to grow this fiscal year"
35,"Over the last quarter, our new team has conducted an extensive strategic review to assess the potential of this business going forward"
36,This has helped us update our expectations about future growth based on the fresh categories in which we compete and is leading to a sharpened strategy
37,"As a result of this work and our current-year performance, we've lowered our expectations for both long-term sales and earnings"
38,We've learned some tough lessons over the last several quarters and we're applying them
39,"As a first step, we started to integrate the supply chain to reengineer the fresh operating model"
40,"We're building a stronger foundation under the Campbell Fresh business, leveraging Campbell's scale and expertise, realizing synergies, and building capacity and capabilities in order to return it to profitable growth"
41,Let me now take each piece of the business individually and explain
42,Let's start with farms and specifically the carrot business
43,"After experiencing quality issues last year due to execution and poor weather conditions in California, we've restored our carrot quality"
44,We've demonstrated this improved quality to customers and are working hard to earn back the lost business over time
45,Our previous assumptions were too aggressive and regaining share is turning out to be more difficult than planned
46,"In the current quarter, our carrot business faced additional challenges, again related to the weather"
47,"In California, rainfall in December and January was significantly higher than normal"
48,This hampered our ability to harvest fields and lowered our yields on the carrots we did harvest
49,This negatively impacted both sales and earnings in the quarter
50,Now let's turn to beverages
51,"Last June, we voluntarily recalled our Protein PLUS beverages for quality reasons"
52,"At that time, we had a 47% market share of the protein segment and"
53,Protein PLUS was one of our strongest performing SKUs
54,The good news is that consumers are seeking out protein products and our Protein PLUS consumer is a loyal shopper
55,"As previously discussed, we implemented enhanced processes to improve the quality standards, resulting in fabulous product quality, albeit at reduced run times"
56,"Since then, we've steadily improved but have not returned to pre-recall production levels"
57,We've added an additional beverage line in our Bakersfield plant that we expect to be fully operational in April
58,"As we discussed last quarter, we're seeking additional ways to increase capacity"
59,"We've had challenges in finding co-packers that meet our quality standards, but we've recently qualified a co-packer and expect to be significantly expanding our capacity by the summer"
60,We're able to fulfill shelf-stock and service levels back to the high 90s
61,"In addition, we're seeing increases in velocity each period as we regain distribution"
62,"While we're selling everything we make, we have insufficient capacity to fulfill merchandising demand across the full range of our beverages"
63,Our plan is to re-launch Protein PLUS merchandising in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 when we expect to have sufficient supply
64,"Due to our continued capacity constraints, we don't expect our beverage business to return to growth until the fourth quarter"
65,"Meanwhile, we remain focused on driving innovation across the Bolthouse Farms CPG range, including dressings, spreads, and super-premium and ultra-premium beverages"
66,We recently extended our salad dressing line with a range of four new organic varieties
67,"We also launched a test of Bolthouse Farms MAIO, a new line of refrigerated yogurt-based spreads made with clean ingredients and fewer calories than mayonnaise"
68,"Later this year, we plan to expand our line of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms organic, cold-pressed juice and launched Bolthouse Farms Plant Protein Milk, a higher protein alternative to almond milk"
69,Customer response to this new product has been very positive
70,"Now, turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet"
71,"As a reminder, the business has four product groups: salsa, which is over half of the business; hummus, dips and chips; and fresh soup"
72,The business offers a combination of branded and private-label products
73,"The traits that made Garden Fresh Gourmet an attractive acquisition target, a small authentic brand with a compelling story have also presented some obstacles"
74,"When we acquired it in June 2015, Garden Fresh Gourmet was a small operation with approximately $100 million in revenue and very little infrastructure"
75,The integration into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform proved to be challenging
76,"The truth is, we expected more, faster in multiple areas of this business, including financial systems, information technology, and supply chain integration, as well as increased marketplace distribution"
77,Let me explain the issues we've encountered and what we're doing to fix them
78,"Garden Fresh Gourmet branded salsa is growing strongly in consumption, and we've regained a major customer beginning January 2017."
79,Private-label salsa is below expectations due to lost distribution with two customers
80,We've recently regained one of these customers and active negotiations are underway with the second
81,"Throughout its short history, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa was largely a Midwestern brand"
82,Our plan called for the rapid distribution expansion of branded salsa beyond the Midwest
83,"However, it became apparent that we did not have the differentiated recipes and taste profiles that would be accepted by consumers in other parts of the country"
84,We now have the recipes to pursue expanded distribution
85,"In January, we launched branded Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa in new packaging with new regional recipes"
86,We're focused on key distribution and velocity-building initiatives
87,"For example, in January, we gained national distribution for new branded organic salsa with a major customer"
88,"Today, our ACV distribution of Garden Fresh branded salsa is only 37%, so we have a lot of runway to match the 70% ACV levels of our other C-Fresh CPG brands"
89,"We're optimistic that we can get there with delicious high-quality ingredients, product and packaging innovation, improved marketing and sales support, and expansion into organic and regional flavors"
90,I do want to take a moment to highlight a positive result in the division
91,"We've made significant gains in our fresh soup business, which continues to grow at high single-digits, driven by both private label and branded soup"
92,"We recently introduced a new Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers and initial velocity is encouraging"
93,"We're also testing Souplicity, a new artisanal cold-pressed soup"
94,"We continue to expect to grow the Garden Fresh Gourmet business profitably, but it will take longer than we originally planned"
95,"Overall, we've learned several important lessons from these two packaged fresh acquisitions and we're applying them going forward"
96,"First, establishing a leadership team with diverse skills and experience early on is critical"
97,Our new team combines the talents and capabilities of Campbell and Bolthouse leaders
98,They're actively integrating C-Fresh into Campbell and taking advantage of our full suite of resources
99,We're now blending the best of small while also benefiting from the best of big
100,"Second, fresh food is more perishable and, therefore, more fragile"
101,"At Campbell, we're obsessed with safety and quality"
102,"We put safety above all else because if we don't, nothing else matters"
103,Meeting Campbell's quality standards in C-Fresh required significant investment and the right resources
104,"Third, there's no roof over the carrot fields"
105,We've experienced everything from severe drought to record rainfall
106,This business has been much more volatile than expected
107,"We've set up more diversified growing regions, but we have more to do to strengthen our agricultural operations"
108,"Fourth, the fresh supply chain presents an opportunity for productivity improvement and optimization"
109,We believe we can and will drive margin improvement in these businesses over time
110,"Finally, we have both the ability and the desire to build strong brands and drive growth in response to increasing consumer demand for fresh foods"
111,"To recap, we're facing some challenges in C-Fresh beyond what we originally realized"
112,Our new leadership team is making progress in addressing them
113,"To be clear, we remain committed to the packaged fresh category and to M&A in the fresh space as we build this growth platform"
114,Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks
115,"As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and Kelsen businesses"
116,The organic sales decline in the division was mainly a result of the performance of Kelsen and our decision to forego some less-profitable business for the large U.S
117,"Additionally, the depreciation of the Chinese RMB negatively impacted our sales in China"
118,"Stepping back and looking at the underlying trends in Kelsen, China, we feel good about our execution during the important Chinese New Year period"
119,"As we've discussed previously, we've been working to expand our distribution capabilities in China, and we've been adding new sub-distributors to extend our reach"
120,Our sell-in for Chinese New Year went according to plan and promotion displays were consistently strong across all store formats
121,We're still awaiting consumer takeaway
122,Turning to the U.S
123,", Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth behind the continued strong performance of Goldfish crackers as well as cookies, especially the Milano brand"
124,"Goldfish growth benefited from channel gains, leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products"
125,Goldfish made with organic wheat is also attracting new millennial families to the brand
126,"However, our fresh bakery sales declined as a result of intensified competitive activity, especially in the sandwich bread category"
127,"As a reminder, we're cycling double-digit operating earnings growth this quarter, and we expect a strong back half as this division delivers both sales and margin growth"
128,"Looking ahead, we're focused on driving continued growth in Goldfish and increasing innovation in cookies, especially the upcoming launch of our new farmhouse line in April"
129,These cookies leverage Pepperidge Farm's baking heritage and deliver against our Real Food Philosophy with great taste and simple ingredients
130,We'll also continue to build the national rollout of Tim Tam biscuits in the U.S
131,following its recent launch in January
132,"Rounding out the portfolio is our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
133,I'm encouraged by the sales gains in soup and simple meals
134,"However, this was offset by the lackluster performance of V8 shelf-stable beverages"
135,"I continue to be pleased with the Americas gross margin expansion, driven by the performance of our supply chain team"
136,"Once again, the division delivered strong operating earnings growth of plus 8%"
137,Our U.S
138,soup business grew in the quarter
139,I'm especially pleased with our ready-to-serve brands
140,Sales increased double-digits in ready-to-serve
141,Chunky continued to lead the way behind our improved execution and strong integrated marketing that fully leveraged our NFL sponsorship
142,We're also delighted with the launch of our new
143,Well
144,Yes!
145,"clean label soup, which hit shelves in December"
146,"Retailer acceptance has been exceptional, with ACV already around 75% and most customers taking all nine varieties"
147,We activated our marketing plans in January and the initial consumer response has been positive
148,"It's early days, but we feel good about our overall execution and how we got out of the starting blocks with this brand"
149,"Sales declines in our broth business were as a result of increased competitive activity, mainly from private label offerings"
150,"As discussed last quarter, we had strong holiday merchandising plans for our broth business, and we were pleased with the execution of that program"
151,"However, we did not achieve the consumer takeaway that we expected as a result of an extremely competitive holiday period"
152,"In the short term, we will be sharpening our promotional activity and marketing message to drive improved performance in the back half of the year while we continue to develop longer-term plans to improve our competitiveness and differentiation in this important category"
153,Looking ahead on U.S
154,"soup, we have robust marketing plans in the third quarter and we continue to expect to deliver modest growth in soup this fiscal year"
155,The shelf-stable beverage category remained sluggish and our portfolio continues to be challenged
156,"As I previously stated, V8 will not grow this year"
157,Let me reframe the conversation to provide a little more context
158,"In the quarter, consumption grew in two-thirds of our business: V8 100% Vegetable Juice, Veggie Blends and our V8 +"
159,ENERGY franchise
160,All of them are on trend and leverage our heritage in vegetable nutrition
161,"Importantly, we continue to see improved consumption trends in V8 100% Vegetable Juice, following our increased marketing support"
162,"The remaining one-third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is declining, partly due to category-wide consumer concerns about sugar"
163,"Despite the overall sales declines, the business continues to focus on productivity initiatives, which are contributing to the overall gross margin expansion in the division"
164,"Big picture, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division continues to be on track to deliver modest sales growth and margin expansion"
165,"In closing, I want to stress again that I am not satisfied with our overall sales results this quarter"
166,"I own it, and we have plans in place to improve our performance in the second half, deliver our cost savings, invest back in our business, and deliver our full-year guidance"
167,"It's really important to keep sight of the long-term progress we've made in transforming this company in a difficult operating environment: our continued gross margin expansion, how we strengthened our core business while expanding into faster-growing spaces, the investments we're making in real food as a result of our purpose"
168,", how we've diversified our portfolio with innovation and acquisitions, and a leaner more agile and more cost-effective company we've become as a result of our successful cost-savings initiative"
169,", I look forward to seeing many of you next week at CAGNY where we will focus on Campbell's long-term strategic growth platforms"
170,"Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro"
171,Yeah
172,I'll take that one
173,"Thanks, Ken"
174,We're very pleased with the performance of Pepperidge Farm
175,"We've had, particularly in the snacks business, some really good growth"
176,"And our distribution system – DSD distribution system is different, in that it is a network of independent contractors, so that's really how we've assessed it"
177,"I mean, we're continuing to run our play"
178,We're very happy with the introduction of
179,Well Yes!
180,"There were great retail support, 75% ACV distribution, displays everywhere, but we won't get a read on the consumer takeaway really until this quarter"
181,"Hi, Bryan"
182,"Hey, Andrew"
183,"Andrew, it is a key question"
184,"And when I talk about getting the best of small and the best of big, I'm really serious about what we have done"
185,"is really delineated those parts of the business that really need to be separate and differentiated for the consumer and the customer, and that's all of the marketing and the R&D and insights"
186,And we have this model that we've used very successfully with our Plum organic baby food business by keeping those parts of the business separate that maintains that entrepreneurial culture
187,"However, being able to leverage the scale of Campbell's, particularly in areas of the supply chain and in operations where we have resources that can be used to make them much more effective and efficient and even more important achieve scale, because these are typically smaller companies that need the chassis to increase scale in the marketplace"
188,So we've done this very successfully with Plum and Kelsen
189,We have not done it with the Campbell Fresh business
190,"And so, the situation that we found ourselves in in the last year, we've been able to insert Campbell executives on the leadership team working in conjunction with Bolthouse Farms executives to maintain that best of small and best of big"
191,So we're really optimistic and we're finding some really great opportunities to put a stronger foundation under the business
192,See you next week
193,"Hi, Rob"
194,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
195,LLC Hi
196,Yeah
197,I think the activity definitely varies by category
198,And what we've seen in the fresh bakery business is competition in the area of sandwich bread and Swirl bread
199,We've recently reformulated our Swirl bread and we're out there now with a much-improved product
200,So that was a very specific situation
201,"In fresh bakery business, our buns and rolls business continues to rock, so we believe we're all over the issue there"
202,"And then in broth, it was really more of a proliferation of private label during the holiday and that produced more price competition and we have responded with increased marketing and actual trade spending to hold our own in that category"
203,So those were two very specific things that we faced
204,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
205,LLC
206,Can I ask a follow-up to Ken Goldman's question actually?
207,I think what he was kind of getting at is
208,"have you ever considered a model where you go to direct-to-customer shipments through warehouses rather than DSD, not so much using – whether you use independent routes"
209,Is that a big savings or is it even possible in Pepperidge Farm?
210,Yeah
211,We've been pleased with the DSD system
212,"The independent contractors, what they bring to the business in terms of selling and merchandising and delivery, it's a quality product"
213,"It's perishable, so breakage could be an issue"
214,"I think when you consider all of it, we're pleased with our DSD system"
215,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
216,LLC
217,Okay
218,Thank you
219,We're very focused on our soup business
220,"We're particularly pleased with the performance of ready-to-serve soup, whether that be Chunky or the introduction of new"
221,Well
222,Yes!
223,I think you need to ask the other guy
224,Hi Alexia
225,"The strategic review that the new team undertook looked at, once again, the potential for this business, and we verified the consumer trends toward fresh and health and well-being, the fact that these categories are still growing significantly faster than center-store categories, particularly in the categories that we compete in"
226,So we feel really good about this space strategically
227,We've had some execution issues this year and some weather issues in the agricultural part
228,"That's been unfortunate, but that does not sway us from our long-term strategic vision to really build a fresh food platform for Campbell's"
229,And I think the role of the carrots in the business is the authenticity
230,It's on trend with consumers' desire for fresh produce
231,"Carrots have had a tough go with drought and with heavy rains and some execution issues in the last year, but I do think that that's an important part"
232,It's also the distribution system and scale in produce for us that makes us more important to the retailer
233,So I know I'm very committed to the business
234,and we expect big things from it going forward
235,"I think, over time, we have an opportunity to build two very strong brands here with Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet"
236,"We're continuing to invest in digital marketing, as you point out, some new packaging and definitely new product innovation"
237,So we will continue to support these businesses in the marketplace
238,"Hi, Rob"
239,"Well, as you can see from the quarter, we're continuing to invest in marketing and brand building"
240,"And Anthony pointed out that as we navigate through our cost-savings initiative, which we just increased, we will be spending back on our businesses to continue to build these brands"
241,We still need to drive sustainable profitable sales growth
242,and I fundamentally believe that's going to come from investing in the brands and engaging with the consumer
243,So we will continue on that track
244,Thank you
