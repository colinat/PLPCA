1,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call"
2,"Today, I’ll share my perspective on our performance this quarter and outline our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year"
3,"First, some context on the macroeconomic environment"
4,Overall macroeconomic trends in the U.S
5,improved slightly in the quarter
6,Consumer confidence edged up and unemployment declined modestly
7,"However, in the first quarter of the calendar year, consumer spending only grew 0.3%, its lowest level of growth since 2009."
8,"Consumers entered 2017 facing a variety of interrelated pressures and complexities from economic shifts, delayed tax refunds and general uncertainty"
9,"Many consumers continued to struggle financially, especially lower income and younger shoppers"
10,"Additionally, the retailer environment continues to be very aggressive, with e-commerce and value players applying increased pressure on grocery and mass channels and we do not anticipate this trend to abate anytime soon"
11,Food companies certainly felt the pinch
12,"It was a challenging quarter across the industry as top line growth remains scarce, especially in center-store categories"
13,Consumers continue to migrate to fresher and healthier foods found on the perimeter of food stores
14,"Like the majority of our peers, early in the calendar year, we experienced significantly lower consumption across almost all of our categories"
15,"At Campbell, we felt it most acutely in February"
16,"While trends improved as the quarter progressed, growth in March and April was insufficient to offset the earlier weakness"
17,"In the context of this unfavorable operating environment, we delivered competitive results in the third quarter"
18,"Although our top line was below our expectations, we grew or maintained market share in 11 measured categories, representing 75% of our U.S"
19,retail dollar sales
20,Looking at Campbell’s results
21,"Organic sales declined 1%, adjusted EBIT declined 2%, and adjusted earnings per share declined 9% to $0.59 a share, primarily due to a higher adjusted tax rate"
22,The sales decline in the third quarter resulted from softer than expected soup sales the ongoing capacity related challenges in Campbell Fresh refrigerated beverages and weakness in V8 beverages
23,This more than offset the strong results from Global Biscuits and Snacks in the quarter
24,Let’s look at our 9-month results
25,"Year-to-date, organic sales were down 1%, adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago and our adjusted EPS was up 1%"
26,"Reflecting our performance in the quarter, we revised our fiscal 2017 guidance this morning"
27,"We lowered our sales guidance to minus 1% to 0%, a point below our previous expectations"
28,"Despite the challenges on the top line, we have raised the low end of our adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS ranges"
29,We now expect adjusted EBIT to increase 2% to 4% and adjusted EPS to increase 3% to 5%
30,"We expect that we will be able to offset the impact of lower sales with our ongoing cost saving efforts, which are ahead of our expectations for the fiscal year"
31,"Now, let me share my thoughts on our segment performance for the quarter and offer some perspective on our plans for the balance of the year"
32,"Let’s start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
33,We continued to manage this division for performance consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion
34,"Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter, predominantly driven by U.S"
35,soup and V8 beverages
36,Operating earnings were comparable to a year ago
37,"Importantly, we continued to expand gross margin in the division, even as we made investments in real food"
38,"As we previously outlined, we are in the process of eliminating artificial colors and flavors from our products, removing BPA from the can liners in our soup portfolio and increasing the use of real food ingredients such as chicken with no antibiotics in our soups"
39,"Despite gaining share in the quarter, soup sales declined 4%, year-to-date, soup sales declined 1%"
40,"Although soup performance improved throughout the quarter, we were unable to overcome the slow start in February"
41,"Sales of condensed soup and broth declined, while our ready-to-serve portfolio grew"
42,"Promotional activities in support of condensed soup did not generate the anticipated lift, while the decline in broth was the result of continued competitive activity from private label"
43,"On the plus side, sales growth in our ready-to-serve portfolio was fueled by Chunky and our new"
44,Well
45,Yes! soup line
46,"Chunky benefited from increased merchandising, improved marketing and new items"
47,We remain enthusiastic about the launch of our new
48,Well
49,Yes! clean label soup
50,Customer response has been strong and consumer trial is ahead of expectations
51,"In the fourth quarter, we are planning to expand the Well Yes! line with five new varieties and to introduce a significant line extension to Chunky, new Chunky Max Bowls [ph], featuring 40% more protein"
52,"Given our performance year-to-date and with the season being largely complete, we are now calling for soup sales to be down slightly for the year even while we gained market share"
53,"Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong consumption, increased distribution in club channels and contributions from Prego’s farmers market"
54,V8 beverages continued to struggle as the shelf stable juice category remains challenged
55,"As discussed last quarter, two-thirds of our shelf-stable juice portfolio, V8 100% Vegetable Juice, Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy is on trend and leverages our heritage in vegetable nutrition"
56,The remaining third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is under pressure due in part to category wide consumer concerns about sugar
57,"In the quarter, sales of both Fusion and Splash declined while V8 100% Vegetable Juice grew behind continued media investments"
58,V8 +Energy also grew as we expanded distribution of new carbonated varieties
59,"Year-to-date, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is performing in line with its portfolio role"
60,"While organic sales have declined 1%, operating earnings have increased 5%"
61,Moving on to Campbell Fresh
62,", C-Fresh remains an important strategic business for Campbell"
63,and we are confident in the growth potential of the Packaged Fresh category as consumer preferences for fresher and healthier foods remain strong
64,"C-Fresh sales declined 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by continued production constraints following the June 2016 voluntary recall of Protein PLUS beverages"
65,"As discussed during our last call, we have implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards"
66,"We also started up a new beverage line in Bakersfield in the quarter and are in the midst of qualifying a new co-packer, which is slated to come online late in the fourth quarter"
67,"As expected, we still haven’t returned to our original production levels"
68,We have been able to fill orders for shelf stock
69,"However, we have been unable to execute normal promotional activity across the fresh beverage portfolio"
70,We expect continued capacity constraints through the fourth quarter as we fully operationalize our new line and our co-packer starts production
71,We will begin increasing promotion activity towards the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and expect to ramp up to normal levels in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
72,"On the innovation front, the reception of our new Bolthouse Farms products, including the new plant-based protein milk, has been positive by retailers"
73,We will start shipping this exciting new product early next fiscal year
74,Turning to our farms business
75,Sales declined slightly driven by the natural ingredients business
76,"We have made good progress stabilizing our carrot business, which delivered modest sales growth in the quarter as our quality and customer service levels have improved"
77,"Overall, we are moving in the right direction under our new leadership team"
78,We have leveraged this tough situation this year to build the stronger foundation for growth
79,"Looking ahead, we anticipate that C-Fresh will deliver modest sales growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the Protein PLUS recall"
80,"While we expect the beverage business will continue to improve, we will still be operating with less capacity than we had a year ago"
81,Turning now to Global Biscuits and Snacks
82,"This division unifies our biscuits and snacks brands across Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen"
83,The team delivered strong results in the quarter
84,Sales increased 2% and EBIT was up 14%
85,The two main drivers of the sales increase were Pepperidge Farm and Arnott’s Biscuit in Asia-Pacific
86,"First, Pepperidge Farm"
87,I am pleased with the performance of the team
88,"Pepperidge Farm snacks continued to deliver strong results, fueled by Goldfish Crackers and Pepperidge Farm Cookies"
89,"Continued Goldfish growth was driven by larger pack sizes and multi-packs, increased advertising and the continued expansion of our health and well-being offerings, especially Goldfish made with organic wheat"
90,"In cookies, sales increased across most of the portfolio"
91,We are pleased with the April launch of our new Farmhouse Cookie brand
92,These new thin and crispy cookies are simply delicious
93,"They leverage our baking heritage and are made with simple, real food ingredients"
94,"It’s early days, but retailer response has been positive with more than 50% ACV distribution"
95,Consumers have also responded very favorably
96,"Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business, driven by Pepperidge Farms sandwich and swirl bread, coupled with increased spending to counter competitive activity"
97,Buns and rolls delivered strong growth
98,Turning to Australia
99,"In a very challenging trading environment, we delivered sales growth in our biscuit portfolio"
100,Our new Arnott’s
101,Tim Tam gelato-inspired varieties are performing well with strong customer acceptance and consumer takeaway
102,"In addition, Arnott’s Shapes continued to regain share with the return to several popular original flavors"
103,"We are preparing to ship at the end of July new multi-pack single-serve Arnott’s Shapes, Tim Tams and Tiny Teddies in multiple sizes for take-home and on-the-go consumer occasions"
104,"In addition, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well with organic sales growth in both Indonesia and Malaysia"
105,We are confident that the division will finish the year on a high note as we expect to maintain our current momentum and deliver solid sales growth and double digit operating earnings in the fourth quarter
106,"In conclusion, our team delivered competitive performance and what continued to be an extraordinarily difficult operating environment"
107,"However, we clearly have more work to do to address our sales performance"
108,"Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our plan calls for improved performance to finish the year as we cycle the Bolthouse Farms protein drink recall, last year’s carrot quality issues and a higher adjusted tax rate"
109,"Additionally, we expect Global Biscuits and Snacks to maintain its current momentum"
110,We also plan to return to more normal marketing level versus the stepped-up levels of a year ago
111,"Finally, we are on track to slightly exceed our multi-year $300 million cost savings target by the end of the fiscal, a year earlier than originally planned"
112,"And as we announced last quarter, we are pursuing incremental cost savings of $150 million over the next few years"
113,Thank you
114,And I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes
115,"With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro"
116,"Hi, Andrew"
117,I think that the gross margin expansion that we have achieved has been done with a lot of analytic rigor and has gone after things that really are not hurting the business
118,And we definitely have kept our investment in advertising consumer and trade around that 24% level and that really hasn’t changed although the mix changes by brand depending upon the competitive situation that it’s in
119,"With the $300 million, we have been able to save through our effective cost savings program, we have reinvested a significant portion of that back into the business and intend to do so as we go forward in pursuit of the $150 million that we will save"
120,"When you peel it back, our top line really needs to benefit from the return to growth of Campbell Fresh, which we expect next year and also continued progress to stabilize our V8 beverage business"
121,Our Global Biscuits and Snacks business has momentum
122,Condensed is pretty stable
123,RTS grew nicely and we are under some pressure in broth
124,So we know what we have to do to get to that growth rate
125,"Hello, Bryan"
126,"Right, okay"
127,"So first of all, in the farms business, we believe that we are getting to stability on that business with significant improvements in quality and customer service"
128,"And then in the beverage business, by the end of the fourth quarter, we should be in a situation where we can produce enough product to satisfy shelf stock and also promotion merchandising demands from customers"
129,"Today, we are selling what we make"
130,and we can only fulfill shelf stock although that capacity is getting better with the line that we just put into our own plant and then the co-packer will get us back to where we can actually supply
131,We have plans to start to amp up on the beverage business early in fiscal 2018.
132,"And we expect, with the right marketing and promotion program with customers, we will continue to see that business growth"
133,And we are planning on growth for that business next year
134,"From the profit side, we have invested seriously this year in quality, but yet, we do expect margin expansion from this business for a couple of reasons"
135,"First of all, as we have delved into the supply chain, we have been able to realize that we have got opportunities for productivity"
136,"And quite frankly, it’s a significant portion of the $150 million cost savings program that we have talked about before"
137,"And secondly, we expect margin expansion just from the fact that we will be growing the CPG higher margin business at a faster rate than the lower margin carrot business"
138,So we should have some margin expansion due to mix shifts
139,So that’s how we are looking at it at this point
140,"And of course, we will keep you posted along the way"
141,"I mean the environment in biscuit continues to be competitive, just like the rest of the environment, but we are very pleased with the performance of our Pepperidge Farm and our Arnott’s business"
142,I think the competitive situation you are talking about is in the United States
143,The program that we are running in the biscuit business is we are advertising our brands like Goldfish and Milano
144,"We have increased innovation in all of our brands and with new innovation in Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies, which we are excited about"
145,"These cookies are clean label simple ingredients and thinner, crispy"
146,They just provide a different experience
147,We have also upgraded our classic cookie line to respond to the fact that the market has moved in terms of quality and we need to maintain that edge
148,"And then finally, we have a lot of confidence in our direct store delivery network in terms of their ability to merchandise and work the shelf in store"
149,And we think that combination is serving us well and our business results are proving that out
150,Yes
151,"Let me start first with the retailer landscape, which is really competitive and we have got value players and e-commerce putting pressure on more conventional retail grocery and mass channels"
152,"And in that environment, the amp-up of promotion and also the push on private label continues to be pretty robust"
153,What we have actually done in terms of our promotional spend is we have spent on broth for the holiday this quarter
154,and we experienced some lower lift
155,We have increased our support – our promotion support on V8 +Energy because that brand is really gaining a lot of momentum
156,"And the rest of our promotional spending has been on Global Biscuits and Snacks and particularly in Asia Pacific biscuits, we have a strong promotional program there"
157,"And then finally, we did hold our in-season soup prices longer than prior year"
158,"And in an EDLP environment, that actually hits the promotion line"
159,But I assure you that we are continuing to manage the depth and frequency of our promotional program while we remain competitive and we have to do that
160,And we will continue to make marketing investments accordingly
161,"And looking at our categories, most of them have – private label has been pretty much as it always has been, but we did experience an up-tick in soup and in particularly in the broth area"
162,"Well, suffice it to say that we have always run a multi-channel business and so this isn’t the first time that the retail landscape has morphed, although I have to say that I personally have called the shift to digital and e-commerce a seismic shift"
163,So we are definitely making longer term plans to address that
164,"But in the current term, e-commerce is about 4% of food sales and we are setting up resources to address that, but I can assure you that we still have very strong resources against our traditional partners"
165,"I mean, it’s a great question and we really have to look at the marketing mix by brand and what the brands’ objective is and how they are targeting, because under the A), there has also been a lot of movement away from classic TV and print and into digital, which creates a whole different kind of marketing, content development and a lot of efficiencies there"
166,And we are still all getting better at how we measure effectiveness
167,"But I also think in the, A), with the cost savings programs we have been running, we have been doing lots of deep dives into what’s working media, what’s not working media and how do we make sure we are moving more of our dollars to work harder for us"
168,"So, that’s the high level answer on A"
169,"Of course, we are watching some of the shift to T, where we have got a very robust revenue management analytics group that supports our marketing and our sales force"
170,"They are looking at net price realization, because it’s not only list price"
171,It’s also EDLP
172,It’s also promoted price points
173,"And so those vary by brand, but they are all tucked into the T part of ACT"
174,"And then finally, we are also seeing a bit of an uptick in shopper marketing and that’s involved in that T as well"
175,"So, again, I think it’s really hard to give you a one-size-fits-all answer, but this is a hypercompetitive marketplace and you have got to be agile in terms of how you run the business to make sure that we are remaining competitive"
176,And we are proud of the fact that despite the difficult environment we have been able to maintain our market share across 75% of our business
177,"Hi, Alexia"
178,"Hello, David"
179,And I will take the second part
180,"David, recall that we put a new leadership team into C-Fresh earlier this year and their mandate was to conduct a deep dive strategic review of the business"
181,And we even retained help to do that so that we make sure that we had a real objective look
182,and we were not talking to ourselves
183,"And so this team did an exhaustive review of the categories, the opportunities, the potential for the business as we have got our capacity back up"
184,We looked at both the CPG businesses
185,We have really looked at the beverage business and then we also looked at the farms business
186,And they came back confirming the potential of the business to deliver growth in excess of our long-term targets and at multiples of center-store categories
187,So we will be running that play
188,That is a 3-year strategic plan that they created and that will go into the next year’s operating plan
189,"So we really took this opportunity in a tough situation to go all the way back to go and say, what did we assume when we bought this business and are those assumptions still valid, and how do you see the potential of this business"
190,"And quite frankly, with the consumers’ shifts to fresh, we think that going forward we are going to be in good position to capitalize on that shift"
191,Yes
192,You look – we run three different kinds of supply chain here
193,We run a warehouse supply chain
194,We run a fresh supply chain
195,"And then in Pepperidge Farm, as you indicate, we run an independent distribution system through DSD"
196,These distributors are entrepreneurs and they have built a great business
197,"In the snacks business, you do see a portion of the business in warehouse snacks, but you also see a large portion of the snacks business, whether it be sweet, savory or salty in DSD"
198,So we still believe in the model for this category and the operations part of it calls for a very focused category distribution
199,That’s where you can get the maximum effectiveness and efficiency
200,"In fact, we have two separate DSD networks, one for bakery and one for snacks, because of that reason"
201,And we do believe that DSD also helps with the quality of the product and making sure that we are working the shelves every day
202,"The fresh bakery, we have been under pressure with Swirl bread and sandwich bread"
203,We have now increased the quality and reformulated our Swirl bread
204,and we are out with new sandwich bread offerings
205,So we believe we have responded to that
206,And our buns and roll business seem – continues to be really robust
207,and we will be continuing to push that one
208,So bakery was down slightly
209,Yes
210,"Just to specifically answer your question in shakedowns, we actually have shakedowns in a couple of the school systems in the country"
211,We have moved those more out of retail and into working with schools to give kids healthier snacks
212,"In terms of the new management team coming in, their first and foremost objective is now that we have got our quality and our customer service back is to make sure that we are shoring up our business with customers and making sure customers are happy"
213,"In addition to that, we will innovate some things in carrots"
214,"For example, one of the things they have are rainbow carrots where we have been able to grow different colored carrots"
215,"So, we are working with those in a few retailers"
216,But I think suffice it to say that most of the innovation will happen in the CPG business
217,"That’s where we really are pushing innovation, but we will do enough in carrots to make sure that we are keeping that business stable to modestly growing"
218,I am not sure I understood your question
219,What business were you talking about?
220,"I think the refrigerated beverage business is very competitive and we have seen – the advent of ultra-premium juice, the fermented juices coming or fermented beverages coming in, but we do believe we have a great product"
221,and we have a range of across super premium and premium juice
222,"We have been again strapped, because we haven’t had the supply and the capacity to meet that increased demand"
223,"So next year, we will be running a full play"
