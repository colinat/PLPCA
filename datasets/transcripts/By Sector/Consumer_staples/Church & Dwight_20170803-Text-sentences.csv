1,I'll start with EPS
2,"Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, down 4.7% after excluding a $0.12 per share charge related to the previously announced UK pension settlement"
3,"The $0.41 was better than our $0.37 outlook, largely due to our better margins in international and SPD business, some help from tax, slightly higher sales and lower SG&A spending"
4,"Reported revenues were up 2.3% to $898 million, organic sales were 1.8%, at the high end of our 1% to 2% range"
5,"Organic sales growth was driven by our international consumer business, and our SPD division"
6,"Now, let's review the segments"
7,The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales were flat as couponing and promotional investments impacted net sales growth
8,"Growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergents, OXICLEAN laundry detergent and stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was offset by declines in XTRA laundry detergent, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kits and TROJAN condoms"
9,We expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2% for the Consumer Domestic business
10,"International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, STERIMAR, OXICLEAN stain-fighter in Mexico and BATISTE, VMS and FEMFRESH in Australia"
11,"So, just broad based growth across the globe"
12,We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 7% for the international business
13,"For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 9.4%, due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business"
14,Milk prices and U.S
15,dairy farm profitability remain at a higher level than a year ago
16,We are raising our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 2% to 3% to up approximately 6%
17,Turning now to gross margin
18,"Our adjusted second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago"
19,"This was a bit better than we'd originally expected, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on the international and SPD side"
20,The Q2 gross margin decline breaks out as follows
21,"We had higher promotional levels in Q2, which resulted in a drag of 180 basis points, gross margin improvement of 70 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity net of commodities was worth about 30 basis points of improvement"
22,Moving now to marketing
23,Marketing as a percent of revenue hit a recent high of 14.6%
24,"Remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that we were beefing up Q2 marketing"
25,"Historically, big quarters were Q2 and Q4, this year Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation"
26,"SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a 460-basis point increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement"
27,"On an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 13% – was 13% of sales up 20 basis points, primarily due to increased amortization from acquisitions"
28,Now to operating profit
29,"The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, which was 190 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to the marketing shift and higher promotional spending"
30,"Other expense was $6.4 million, primarily driven by $9.5 million of interest"
31,Next is income taxes
32,Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% on an adjusted basis
33,"Turning to cash, we generated approximately $250 million of net cash for the first half, a $47 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital, which was a function of a $30 million increase in deferred incentive comp plus higher inventories"
34,This was partially offset by higher cash earnings
35,"So, in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by our investments in our domestic business, continued strong growth in international and a return to growth in our Specialty Products segment"
36,"Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of 3.5% which reflects the consumer domestic business growing at approximately 3%"
37,"Just a remainder 2016 growth was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, therefore the second half of 2017 will benefit from easier comps"
38,"On a two-year stack basis, the first and second half are consistent at around 5%"
39,Gross margin is expected to contract in Q3 with increased levels of promotion and coupon investments
40,"We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year-over-year, with the shift from Q4 to Q3 to continue our innovation support"
41,"We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, compared to $0.47 a year ago, or a 2% decrease year-over-year, which includes $0.02 of dilution from the Water Pik acquisition"
42,The primary drivers of the decrease are higher marketing in support of our new product launches and higher consumer promotional spending
43,"As we end the year, we expect strong earnings growth in Q4, as heavy coupons around new product trial peels off, and the marketing goes back to normal levels"
44,"And now, turning to the full year, and as I go through these metrics please keep in mind that we are excluding any impact from Water Pik"
45,"We're maintaining our expectations for organic sales growth of 3%, we maintain our gross margin improvement guidance of 40 bps improvement year-over-year"
46,Our full-year marketing expectations is approximately 12% of sales consistent with prior years
47,"Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points improvement, when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges"
48,"Other expense is expected to be around $31 million, primarily driven by interest expense, which does not include any interest expense from the Water Pik acquisition"
49,And the tax rate is expected to be around 33%
50,"On a reported basis, we continue to expect EPS to be $1.79, which includes the $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.12 negative impact from the pension settlement and no impact from the Water Pik acquisition"
51,"Excluding those items, we expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share"
52,"And as mentioned previously for the full-year, we expect no net impact from the Water Pik acquisition"
53,"To wrap up, we expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year"
54,This represents an excess of 120% free cash flow conversion
55,We also have some good news on the pension settlement front
56,We were able to beat our original expectations of settlement costs and we have no further pension risk or volatility to worry about as a company
57,So now Matt and I will open it up for questions
58,Question-and-Answer Session
59,Yeah
60,"And the only thing I'd add to that Dara is, of the 600-basis point drag on a price mix perspective, about a third of that was to drive new products and trial"
61,"So, again it's not going to repeat forever"
62,I'll let Matt talk about a macro perspective but
63,for us
64,it's also some of the comps Dara
65,In the first half of 2016 we as a company grew 4%
66,"And so, in the first half of this year, it's around 2%"
67,"So it's the inverse of that in the second half, we grew at about around 2% in 2016, and 4% is our expectation in 2017."
68,"So a couple of our big categories like vitamin and laundry, that's what the comps are for the prior year"
69,"I'll take that, Kevin"
70,"It's a couple of things, really"
71,"Domestic, we brought down slightly"
72,"Personal care in the front half was negative in the quarter especially, but we believe that's going to turnaround because of the comps and other category growth in the back half"
73,So we feel good about that
74,"To the degree that we get any benefits from FX, remember we're typically spending that back"
75,"So to be blunt, our marketing line will probably go up slightly versus our previous expectations"
76,So we just reinvest that if we need to
77,"So I guess, that's a short answer"
78,"Kevin, I'll take the first part maybe"
79,"P&G and everybody always continues to, it's a promotional category, laundry is always a promotional category"
80,"But in the long term, if you take a step back, what's happening at the end of the day, the premium tier usually wins with innovation and the value tier wins because of value and the mid-tier shrinks"
81,"I would say that's no different than what's been happening for the last 52 weeks, 26 weeks and 13 weeks"
82,"And so, if they promote a little bit more, that's usually the higher end"
83,"So, I've got three questions here"
84,I'll take the first one
85,"Really, it's all relative to your perspective, Steve"
86,"I mean for us, we aren't outspending the competition, and I'll give you a couple of facts"
87,"For the quarter, our amount sold on deal for laundry detergent was 36%"
88,On average the category was 35%
89,"For couponing, this is more of a limited measurement, but our data says we're around 30% and the category is around 27%, 28%"
90,"So, maybe we're a basis point two or higher"
91,"For a long time, we've kind of held back, but I think we are not making the situation worse"
92,", we're just getting up to par with our competition"
93,"As Matt said, some of the personal care items are down"
94,So it just looks like the negative drag on price mix because some of our household businesses have higher trade rates
95,So I think that's part of it
96,"I think and the other part, it's probably some of these trial activities are very enticing for the consumer"
97,"And so, when that happens, the volume goes up, but also price – the negative price mix goes up right along with it"
98,"So, that's"
99,kind of what happened
100,I think in both cases
101,"Hey, Jason"
102,"Yeah, sure"
103,"I'll start with that one and then go into the, kind of the outlook again, but in my script I said we had a drag of about 180 basis points on promotional spending, with negative price mix, mainly negative price"
104,"We had a 30 basis point drag from commodities, plus 60 basis point on productivity"
105,and then we had around 80 basis points of help from acquisitions and divestitures to get to the minus 80 basis points for the quarter
106,And so we're essentially flat to slightly up for the first half
107,"I think as you look at the second half, there's a few things going on"
108,"Number one, some of that new product trial, the deep couponing kind of that peels off as you get the repeat purchases without all the promotional activity"
109,"So, that's a good thing for gross margin"
110,I think our productivity pipeline continues to improve
111,"Commodities, the drag gets a little less in the second half as we start to lap some of the negativity we had in the back half of 2016."
112,"I think, the personal care question you raise is a fair one, but I think more than anything, it's more of a comp analysis"
113,"Again, a good example of that is just this, the VMS business was very promotional in the first half of 2016 as well because we were winning back the consumer because we were out of stock in 2015."
114,And so we don't have that level of promotion
115,"Is the category maybe a little bit more promotional, yes"
116,"But, year-over-year it still won't comp that"
117,"So, hopefully that helps"
118,"Okay, Andrea"
119,"So, there is a couple of questions in there"
120,"The first is on Water Pik, you're exactly right"
121,It's flat for the full year
122,"We have a $0.02 drag in Q3, largely because of the transactional and transitional expenses and not a full quarter worth of earnings"
123,And then a plus $0.02 for the fourth quarter and flat for the year
124,"Your second question, so that implies with our Q3 outlook, that implies a 20% growth rate in earnings in Q4."
125,"You're exactly right, that's really two things, 20% is around $0.09 and that's really two things"
126,"One is that half of it is the shift of marketing that we've been talking about all year long, right we said we're going to move a lot of our Q4 spending into Q2 and Q3 to better line up with our new product"
127,launches
128,That's about half of it
129,"The other half is, as we've mentioned before we have a better organic growth rate in the back half of the year, so and some gross margin improvement"
130,"So, those are the two things driving 20% growth"
131,And then the third question you had was a 400 basis point drag in couponing
132,"Now remember a year ago – that's not just couponing by itself, it's also couponing trade spends and plotting and what not"
133,"So, it's a little lumpy in 2016 compared to 2017."
134,"I'd tell you that we have some promotional spending throughout the balance of the year, but it's not like we're pulling everything back"
135,and we hope we're going to continue to do great without spending
136,"Like we said before, we're hitting our levels right at our competition"
137,I understand
138,The biggest driver is actually mix right
139,"We've said in the first half of the year, part of that 400 basis points drag is personal care,"
140,right
141,And so we expect personal care to be better in the second half right
142,"My answer to Lauren was part of the reason we have a negative price mix, when you look at organic growth is because we have more household increase and then personal care declining"
143,And so just as that naturally balances back out that will improve the negative drag on the price mix line too
144,And the laundry category is only up around 1% or 1.5%
145,So it's not like the consumption was sky high
146,"No, Olivia, we still have growth in untracked channels, we're not lapping any big gains or anything like that"
147,"We still have growth, it's just the biggest driver is between the Nielsen data and even when you add in the untracked stuff is the negative drag from couponing"
148,And there is a little bit of retailer inventory shifts but the primary driver is the gross to net couponing stuff
