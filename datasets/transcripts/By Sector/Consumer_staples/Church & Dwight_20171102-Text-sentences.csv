15,There will be a lot more to come on this topic in the future
16,Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 7.5% organic growth
17,dairy farm profitability remains at a higher level than a year ago
18,We are starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle
19,The acquisition of the Agro BioSciences business earlier this year is an important building block for animal productivity business
20,We've seen good growth for the probiotics products – that's a tongue twister
21,We have seen good growth for the probiotics products in the poultry industry and our new business development efforts in the dairy industry are translating into new sales
22,"Turning, now, to some of our domestic categories, the laundry category declined 30 bps in Q3, driven by higher promotional levels and slower unit dose category growth, yet our laundry business grew 380 basis points in consumption"
23,"Once again, we were able to grow share in the quarter"
24,"That momentum has carried into October – and by the way, October promotional levels have also come back in line"
25,ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 31st consecutive quarter
26,OXICLEAN laundry detergent gained share sequentially with improved efficacy claims and packaging
27,"And now, finally, unit dose, behind our new Triple Chamber unit dose innovation, our consumption has outpaced the unit dose category rate for the sixth consecutive quarter"

35,The dry shampoo category is now $140 million in the U.S

40,There's been a lot of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins
41,"We haven't been participating, so that's been slowing our growth"
42,The condom category declined in consumption by 2.7% in the quarter
43,"TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down, although some of that is offset by online consumption"

45,Innovation is always a catalyst to category growth
46,"Our new XOXO condom, which is geared towards women, is going very well"
47,"Finally, we closed the Waterpik acquisition in the quarter"
48,We were attracted to Waterpik because it has a bright future as consumer awareness of the importance of gum health continues to grow
49,Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year
50,"We said on prior calls that our – the three big brands that generally drive the international business are STERIMAR, BATISTE and"
51,– I forgot the third one
52,"STERIMAR, BATISTE and FEMFRESH"
53,"In addition to that, in North America, ARM & HAMMER has been growing really well for us, ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, both in Canada and in Mexico"
54,"You know, as far as the business goes, the business is extremely healthy and we've had broad-based growth across virtually all of our countries in the third quarter"
55,"As I said before, our long-term algorithm is for the international business to grow 6% annually, and we're confident that we can deliver that"
56,"As far as my comments earlier about Asia, so Asia-Pacific is extremely attractive to us"
57,It has a growing middle class
58,"I mean, the countries we'd be most interested there would be Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand"
59,"And with a growing middle class using increasing consumption of personal care products, and our products are under-represented there, so we're looking at consolidating our resources in that area, making more investments in the future"
60,"You're only the second question in, Kevin, so you didn't miss it"
61,"So, our categories in the first half of the year grew 1.5%"
62,"That's ticked down a bit in the third quarter; a little over 1% for our categories, so – and we expect the same for Q4, and I think that's reflected in our full year call, up 2.5%"
63,The other piece of that is international
64,International has had big growth for three quarters
65,"They're going to be much lower in the fourth quarter, and that's – it can be somewhat lumpy in international, and"
66,one of the reasons for that is because of export
67,"We have lots of different countries, so it doesn't always come in that evenly"
68,"It's no reflection of our long-term expectation of international, but international will be part of the story for the fourth quarter and why we'd be a little bit short"
69,"No, we came in at 6% – 6% and change organic for the quarter for international"
70,"It's early – we had a big first quarter for international, so it's a little bit lumpy"
71,"So, it'll be our lowest quarter of the year, but it's just going to fall over into 2018."
72,"We didn't get into that level of detail as far as the net sales growth in the quarter, but what I can say is – what we had said is"
73,it's going to grow above our evergreen target of 4%
74,The business did perform well in August and September
75,"So, we think that this business is going to be a big part of our story going forward"
76,"Some things we've learned, it's a very innovative culture; 20% of the business is online, which might be astonishing to you"
77,It's sort of very sophisticated in how to sell online
78,"I would think international is a big opportunity, because only $50 million of their business is international today"
79,"And of course, we have a $700 million business in international"
80,"So, we have a lot of leverage that we can help those guys grow their business"
81,"So, it's –"
82,we're very happy with this acquisition
83,The integration is going very well
84,"Integration is not dependent upon people as much as it is a focus on how we can leverage the Church & Dwight with the suppliers and, also, the networks that we have internationally to grow their business"
85,"Yeah, tapering pricing in this environment is very difficult"
86,"I mean, generally the only categories you're going to be taking price in is where you have a clear number one share, and even then, you need to have a story with respect to input costs"
87,"So, that would be, for example, in condoms for latex"
88,"So, I think price – pass-through of input costs is generally difficult"
89,"Typically, what you see is changing in quantity sizes, in ounces and units in a package, is how you're going to get price"
90,"Hey, Jason"
91,"You can always ask a question, Jason"
92,Yeah
93,"Well, as you know, Jason, we only give our outlook every February"
94,"So, we have no intention of giving a 2018 outlook today"
95,"What I can remind everybody of is that we have an evergreen target of 3% organic growth, annually, and that target is based on Domestic growth of 2%, International of 6%, and Specialty Products of 5%"
96,"And the Specialty Products of 5% is driven by the fact that, over the last couple years, we bought a couple of businesses, one was VI-COR, the other Agro BioSciences that got us into things other than dairy, so we're expecting a lot of growth from that business going forward"
97,"Well, we're already seeing those trends in the fourth quarter"
98,We're seeing that both vitamin consumption and condom consumption has improved from quarter-to-quarter
99,"Now, we can – it's a little early with respect to answering your fourth quarter question when XOXO could be part of that story for condoms"
100,"And obviously, we had some new innovation on the vitamin side of the business"
101,"BATISTE, of course, is in dry shampoo, has been a rocket ship for us"
102,"You might have probably heard on my comments that that category grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter and, at the same time, we grew share tremendously and we are at 33% share"
103,That's a category that's $140 million
104,"And if it grows as fast as the UK and where the UK levels off, it will be a $300 million category"
105,So it gives you a little bit of color on three categories in Personal Care
106,I think the way to think about categories is you got to look at the volumes
107,"So, the volumes are healthy in a lot of categories, so the real story is, when it comes to dollars, it's simply price; and, that's going to vary from category to category"
108,"And typically, it's much greater in household categories than it is in personal care, but as long as volumes stay healthy, I think that's a good barometer"
109,"So, I don't think that the price is something that is going to last permanently, but certainly it's something we're all dealing with now"
110,Yeah
111,"As far as your question on Waterpik, as I said before, it's a really impressive group of people that run that business"
112,"And when it comes to working online, it's early days, but what we've seen with respect to their development of web pages, the development of content for online, their social listening skills, the fact that they're already focused on Amazon, have sales on Amazon in Europe, they've been in it for – and more sophisticated than we've been for a number of years"
113,"So, we do think we can learn a lot from these guys"
114,"As far as is there any one specific category that would benefit, I mean, certainly it would be Personal Care more than Household because Personal Care lends itself more to online sales than Household"
115,But it's a good question and we're very happy that these guys are now part of the family
116,"Hey, Caroline"
117,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
118,on the acquisition – Good morning
119,"On the acquisition contribution outlook, it just seems that the contribution was bigger than we had expected in the past quarter"
120,"So, if you could just give us a sense from a sales standpoint whether you see that Waterpik is coming in ahead of plan?"
121,"And then, staying with Waterpik, what percent of the sales come from sort of electronic –"
122,the gadget part and what percent from the replacement part
123,"that's more the annuity business, and just what's the cycle there?"
124,Just a little deeper understanding would be really helpful
125,Yeah
126,"Sure, Caroline"
127,"On the second one, in terms of the mix between units versus replacement, it's predominantly units, okay"
128,It's a very small percentage that's replacements
129,"That's not really as applicable at this time, right"
130,"Maybe that'll change one day in the future, but right now, it's largely just the replacement units"
131,"and it's like a three-year replacement cycle, in general"
132,"So that's why innovation is so important, but that's also why category penetration is really the driver behind that business"
133,"And then, your first question was on Waterpik and just the contribution"
134,We're not going to give details of the businesses; we just don't
135,That's not our past practice
136,"We haven't done that with any acquisition, whether it was Avid, Orajel, or OxiClean"
137,"I'm trying to be as clear as we can, but for EPS it's a neutral impact for the year"
138,and that's what we're going to stick with
139,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
140,Got it
141,"And then, just within the – you touched a little bit on the pricing environment and couponing, but are there any metrics you can put around what's going on in the vitamin business and just help us understand what the – how long this price war might continue?"
142,Yeah
143,"Well, look, when it comes to vitamins, the category is healthy"
144,"There are a lot more competitors out there right now than when we first bought the business, so there's lots of options for consumers"
145,"The space has expanded, as far as when you go on shelf, and the space has expended largely for the existing pill brands that are now creating gummy products and expanding gummy products, like"
146,"Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Centrum"
147,"And there's a fair amount of brand loyalty when somebody switches from pills to capsules, and BOGOs are exacerbating that transition"
148,"So, we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs, which as I said, is affecting our ability to grow"
149,We do have a new ad campaign right now to try to break through the noise in the gummy category and we do expect to be up in the fourth quarter
150,"But yeah, it's concerning and something that we continue to watch, Caroline"
151,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
152,"Just lastly on that, is Amazon a major player there?"
153,Because one of our fears – and I think investors across the board are just wondering which categories is Amazon going to become a big private label player?
154,And are you seeing them in any of your categories at this point?
155,"I mean, in gummy vitamins, we're the number one gummy on Amazon"
156,"In fact, our shares are super high in Amazon in comparison to what they are in bricks and mortar, so no worries there right now"
157,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
158,"The reason for that is private label today in laundry, and has been for a long, long time, is generally mid-tier"
159,It's not a deep value
160,"And if you look at the long-term trends, mid-tier has been the share donor to premium and to value detergent for a long, long time"
161,"And the reason you don't have a value in private label is because you already have deep value laundry detergent products on shelf, and so it's very difficult to make any money in deep value and come in as the opening price point below an extreme value laundry detergent"
162,"So, yeah, private label laundry detergent really is miniscule in the U.S"
163,I wouldn't say it's a distribution game
164,It's really more innovation
165,"So, the folks at Waterpik are experts in water jet technology"
166,"And just as they have the number one share and really own the water flosser category, they also have the number one share in replacement showerheads"
167,"So, there's – regulations typically affect the replacement showerhead business"
168,"In other words, the number of gallons per minute, today, generally around 2.0; that's going to go lower in the future"
169,"Question is, do you have the technology to deliver the same consumer experience that you did when you had a higher water flow?"
170,"So, it's – to go back to your question, it's not a distribution game"
171,It's really an innovation game
172,I'll give you an example of innovation
173,"So, one of the new products is a Pet Wand"
174,"So, you know that more people have pets than children today, and that continues to grow"
175,"So, it's getting behind that particular trend"
176,"So, its translating their technology in the shower into a wand for washing your pets"
177,"And to answer your second question, in my time with the company, we have looked at bigger transactions than the Waterpik transaction, which is our most recent one"
178,"And as far as other structures go, yeah, we're no strangers to visitors from the major banks coming in, proposing combinations with various companies in the past through other structures, which we'd always be open to to the extent that it is going to create shareholder value"
179,But that's about all I could say
180,"As far as how you react to a competitor move to take price down, typically it's IRCs, immediately redeemable coupons, those are things you can act on pretty quickly"
181,"As far as trade deals with the retailers, usually that's going to be six months out"
182,"Well, thanks for joining us today and we'll see everybody in February with the 2018 outlook"
