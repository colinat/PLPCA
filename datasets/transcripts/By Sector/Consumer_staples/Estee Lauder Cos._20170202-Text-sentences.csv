97,", sales of the core Advanced Night Repair Serum rose 17%, boosted by its innovative Intensive Recovery Ampoules"
98,And a new eye mask that just launched last month as part of the franchise should further lift the serum and the entire collection
99,I'm proud that several of these products are being recognized for their innovation
100,"Last month, Estée Lauder received Marie Claire's prestigious Prix d'Excellence Award in research and development for three products: Advanced Night Repair Powerfoil Mask, Advanced Night Repair Ampoules, and Revitalizing Supreme+"
101,This award honors the most Innovative products of the year
102,"Our innovation is helped by our brands' and retailers' websites, which play a key role as a marketing vehicle to raise awareness of our new products"
103,Millions of people can research the latest launches and read ratings and reviews before purchasing
104,"We will continue to invest in capabilities to further expand our presence online, and our brands are making important strides to stay on the cutting edge of social media, which continues to strongly influence beauty choices"
105,"As an example, in the last years, M•A•C has significantly increased its digital engagement"
106,The number of global Instagram followers of M•A•C has increased by 75% to 40 million and its number of global Facebook fans has climbed sharply
107,"M•A•C has launched local Instagram's account in several markets including Brazil, Germany and Russia and the content is shoppable"

110,Our brands' actions to drive earned media value through influencers is working well
111,a win made (17:58) gains in all product categories
112,"As a company, we have tied to the number one position in earned media value share in Total Beauty is measured by Tribe Dynamics, which quantifies the value of digital content created by third parties about a brand"
113,We have the largest corporate share in skin care and fragrances and we have tied for first in makeup
114,"We have Tom Ford, Smashbox and now Too Faced a strongly growing share of engagement with influencers, which is reflected in the higher shares in prestige beauty"
115,"In the second quarter M•A•C strongly increased its social influencer engagement, which led to a 30% rise in earned media value"
116,"And in another impressive achievement in China, the Estée Lauder brand was ranked number one and the only genius brand in the recent L2 China Beauty Index, which cited the brand leadership in digital marketing, mobile and social media"
117,Now let me turn to outlook
118,We expect to achieve constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017.
119,This includes approximately 1% of incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of Too Faced
120,We continue to expect our sales and profits to accelerate in the second half
121,"The stronger gains are expected to come from four main factors, including organic growth, regular price increases that took effect in January, increased consumer coverage tailored by brand and contribution from the recently acquired brands"
122,"There are certain brands, channels in countries that we believe will be superior growth engines"
123,"They include our luxury brands and the online, travel retail and specialty-multi channels"
124,"By market, we expect China to remain strong and Hong Kong should start stabilizing"
125,"As we capitalize on the best growth prospects, we are also managing costs and reallocating resources from lower growth area to priority ones, aided by Leading Beauty Forward"
126,We continue to hire talent where we need skill sets and investing capabilities that will position us to win in the fast moving competitive world of global prestige beauty for the long-term
127,"With a diversified business that's directed by proven strategy and powered by multiple engines of growth, which we have strengthened even further with our artisanal fragrances and our recent acquisition of fast-growing makeup brands, we are confident in our long-term outlook"
128,Our results will continue to be fueled by the best brand portfolio and the best people in the industry which will drive our winning strategy and continue our leadership in global prestige beauty
129,Now I will turn the call over to Tracey
130,Good morning
131,"Yeah, and just to add one aspect (33:51)"
132,"that, beyond reducing cost and doing of what Tracey is explained, I believe one of the key benefits in the next two, three years of Leading Beauty Forward, to reallocate resources to the fast-growing opportunity and the fast-growing businesses that we have around the world"
133,"So this should further enforce our strengths, on top of creating more cost saving and more margin over the long-term"
134,"And I just would like to add one thing on the top-line, which is – yeah, 4% to 5% organic plus acquisition"
135,is what we see today
136,"And actually, all what we are doing in terms of action is to improve the ability of all of these elements to grow faster in the future"
137,"Meaning the organic is – the good news, there are so many very strong drivers of growth within the current organic travel retail"
138,"China gains, stabilization of Hong Kong, continue of online, and they're all accretive in term of margin"
139,"So the organic, with the activity that we are doing and with actually – with the decrease of the department store in the U.S"
140,", which is, at this point, the most disappointing performance as part of our portfolio, this part is decreasing as a percentage of business"
141,What is increasing as a percentage of business are all the fast-growing channels and fast-growing activity
142,"So the 4% to 5% can become stronger over time and not weaker, plus the acquisition"
143,Now the acquisitions are doing fantastic
144,"We acquired great brands, both this concept of artisanal high-end fragrances, which as I said in my prepared remarks, altogether growing more than 30% and the new acquisitions like Too Faced, the BECCA which have high growth brand into high growth channels"
145,So the mix of improving our organics with a new change of mix and adapting to the new reality and the strong acquisition actually aims to reinforce our growth potential rather than dilute it
146,"So, no, I frankly disagree that over what's happening on M•A•C is out of our control"
147,"There are two things which is happening on M•A•C One, which is a soft traffic in the distribution where M•A•C is present and we need to correct that over time"
148,And so it's kind of in our control
149,We can correct that
150,"And second, if M•A•C had to make improvements in the social media activity penetration and we are making these improvements"
151,And this is in our control and it's an area that we could do better
152,We are doing better as I explained and we'll continue to do even better
153,And the third part is marketing programs
154,"M•A•C quality of collection, quality of innovation will need to improve and continue to improve in the U.S"
155,and we are working on it and some of the things have been already visible in quarter two and more to come in the next quarter
156,"So it's not only a distribution adjustment, it's also a consumer engagement opportunity and also an innovation programs opportunities and we are addressing all of these three"
157,"Then I want to add that on M•A•C we are also working on new freestanding store formats that will address the ability to have freestanding store also in lower productivity situation while low tourist traffic because they will be smaller, more connected online, more engaging for consumers and more profitable"
158,"And the only thing I would like to add is that in a moment of evolution where consumers are really sensitive to innovation and to trying new products, one of the area of promotion where we are investing more is sampling"
159,"And we really are learning more and more how to make samplings very effective, also models that we call paid samplings which are very effective way to do sampling"
160,So we are increasing sampling
161,"And thanks to this, we are increasing the trial level of our new innovations"
162,I will – let me start from the growth
163,So we see the market 4% to 5%
164,"Our goal – our, say, high-end goal has always been to grow at least 1 point more than market, meaning to continue growing market share"
165,And we are delivering that
166,and we believe we'll continue to deliver that in the long-term
167,Now to explain the detail of what happened
168,"In reality, we are taking the estimate down 1%"
169,"That's what's happening, and we are obviously still deliver 6% to 7% thanks to Too Faced"
170,But there is 1% less expected growth than there were before Too Faced
171,Now where this comes from and why we believe will accelerate in the second half
172,This comes from mid-tier department stores in the U.S
173,"that did less than what we expected originally and comes from the Middle East, emerging markets mainly"
174,"Middle East, that was really tough, and Turkey"
175,Turkey was a super high growth market for us and a very unfortunate event of the quarter two make Turkey grow much less than what we were expecting
176,And so this is what was the 1% less
177,"But on the other side, there were many things that continue to do well actually that did even better than what we expected"
178,"So for example, the improvements in Asia particularly in China are even better than expected"
179,The trend stabilization of Hong Kong is very good news
180,"The continued success of Korea is really amazing, and this has huge implication for travel retail"
181,"Frankly, the super high growth of travel retail, which show how our strategy is working is even better than what we could have anticipated"
182,And the online continue to be very strong
183,"So at the end, the net of this is that many of our engines of growth are getting better and better"
184,"Two of the things that took us down in the past, Middle East and Hong Kong are stabilizing, and the issue remains mid-tier department store U.S"
185,"where we do not anticipate a lot of improvements in this quarter, and that's what is the result"
186,"Of our estimate, you need to add to this that our acquisitions are very strong and they could do very well and even better, and so that's the other element of strength that we are adding to the second semester in our ability to deliver our goals"
187,"Now, Tracey, on the EPS?"
188,"So probably I could (52:06) start and say our absolute advertising spending is going to be more or less stable across the year and will be – is assumed to be a bit stronger actually in the second six months, so in the six months we have in front of us, particularly in the third quarter because of innovation launches and activities"
189,"In terms of percentage of sales, so we'll slightly down in the year"
190,"and this percentage is driven also by mix, meaning our advertised – or more advertised brands"
191,", I should say our traditionally advertised brands are becoming a lower percentage of our total business and our brands which are supported by different tools from social media to sampling and to others like in store activities are becoming a bigger percentage of the business"
192,"Because of that, you should assume an overall stability for the next months of our absolute investment, and a slight reduction of percentage of sales"
193,"In gross margin, Tracey, you want to comment on that?"
194,"So on the first question, the answer is yes"
195,The evolution of our channel mix is accretive
196,"But not only to margin, it's also accretive to growth potential, because we are swinging a bigger percentage of our business into higher growth channels, from what we see"
197,So there is a positive margin and positive growth
198,"And to your point, to your second question, I think – I believe I already explained"
199,The key thing is that the key area of acceleration are pricing
200,"We had pricing in January, which had about 2 points of acceleration"
201,"We had a lot of new – particularly for new brands – new distribution opportunities which are planned to start being impacting the business in the second semester, and there are 2, 3 points that will come out of new distribution"
202,"And this new distribution, I do mean – new distribution, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone in new countries, new cities"
203,"So it's not cannibalizing distribution, it's really coverage of consumer"
204,That's why we call it consumer coverage opportunities
205,"Plus, this includes some of the mix acceleration, meaning the moment Estée Lauder brand successfully built doors in ULTA, and they were very well, these automatically create more distribution which grows better"
206,So there is more of this in the second semester
207,"Then there is strong organic growth, the innovation that is working, as we have explained our prepared remark, will now continue to impact and grow in multiple areas"
208,"I believe the good news is that skin care is growing again and is adding this engine – and the other good news is that the engine we just created with these fragrances – high-end fragrances – continue to grow (57:51) very well, and we continue to accelerate growth on a higher base"
209,"Plus, as I explained, Middle East and Hong Kong , they've been two negatives in the first six months, should be better in the second six months"
210,"And finally, the base is lower, frankly, particularly in quarter four"
211,"The base is lower, and so we believe that the combination of these things will bring our organic growth to the level that we are estimating"
212,"On top of that, the new acquisitions, Too Faced and BECCA, are doing very well, so – and we believe they will add the very significant sense of comfort to the ability to deliver the right growth, and by the way, this will continue into next fiscal year"
213,"And going back to the first part of the question is, yeah, we came at the low end of the guidance, but the guidance has a high end and a low end, so I would now conclude is that we have issues forecasting"
214,The issue is the one I explained
215,The issue is that versus our competition
216,We are absolutely overexposed to mid-tier department stores in the U.S
217,particularly
218,And this very high exposure and we have been obviously hit harder than others on the soft traffic that this channel has experienced in the last year
219,And that's why we are trying to react to
220,"We are trying to continue to diversify our business globally in order to be able not to be over-dependent by any channel, any country, any brand"
221,And to have such a well diversified portfolio that we can deliver our 1 point ahead of market or more growth independently from any other area of the business or any specific area of the business
222,"So frankly I'm very proud how we are pivoting the company in terms of online, TR, specialty-multi distribution, how we are pivoting the company in terms of social media versus historical or traditional way to engage the consumers, how we are pivoting the company to penetrate the makeup boom in a very aggressive way, how we are pivoting the company to split up and change our innovation models"
223,We are pivoting and we are pivoting while continue to be one of the fastest growth companies in the consumer industry
224,I personally am very proud of my team in the way we are managing this
225,although we do recognize that we were at the low end of our estimate and we are overexposed to the soft and usual mid-tier department store in the U.S
