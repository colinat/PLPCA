100,"Across our brands, we are focused on the biggest global opportunities, which in Clinique's case means its core products, like moisturizers"

115,"In fragrance, Jo Malone launched Star Magnolia cologne, which is expected to have wide appeal, and Tom Ford created SOLE DI POSITANO, which evokes my fragrant (17:28)"
116,Italian coast
117,"With the help of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, we continue to reallocate resources faster, and cut cost deeper, to invest in talent and capabilities that will drive our business in today evolving beauty landscape"
118,"This includes social media, digital technologies, retail operations, and analytical expertise"
119,"To help leverage both new and existing brands, our brands continue to increase their social media activity and capabilities to engage consumers across numerous digital platforms using influencers, brand ambassadors, and other compelling voices and technologies"
120,"For example, Smashbox collaborated with a popular influencer to help promote its Cover Shot Eye Palette, and the collection became one of the brand's largest launch ever"
121,"And in China, the Estée Lauder brand significantly lifted its makeup sales by leveraging a combination of in-store and social media campaigns"
122,This kind of digital content created by influencers and third-parties is measured in terms of earned media value
123,"In the third quarter, M•A•C remained the second largest beauty brand among prestige and mass makeup players in earned media value in the U.S"
124,", as measured by Tribe Dynamics"
125,M•A•C has improved its earned media value share in makeup in each of the last three quarters
126,Our brands are also creating inventive digital experience for consumers
127,"For example, a cutting edge technology used by Estée Lauder and Smashbox lets consumers virtually apply different lipstick shades, either in real-time or in (19:16)"
128,"Our performance this quarter further demonstrated our company strategy, built on multiple engines of growth and leading to agile resource reallocation, when need, is sustainable and working"
129,Our company has the most desirable portfolio of prestige brands in the industry
130,And we are (19:38) to strategically deploy them brand across fastest-growing channels and consumer segments around the world
131,"Importantly, we have the highest quality workforce with extremely capable people committed to our company's success"
132,"At the same time, we are reducing costs, redesigned for better sales growth leverage, and reallocating our resources to make priority investment in the most attractive areas that are expected to drive our growth in both the fourth quarter and next year"
133,"As a successful high growth company in a growing industry, we have continued to increase our global share in prestige beauty"
134,"And as we enter our fourth quarter, we are further building momentum to deliver another year of strong profitable growth"
135,"Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey"
136,"So the growth is very, very strong in these two brands"
137,"So, it's very strong double-digit growth in each one of the two brands and in every segment they're operating"
138,"And what is driving the success is actually same-door sales is a success, which is driven mainly by same-door sales and for the moment, a very small initial distribution deployment"
139,These two brands are really strong and consumer demand is exceptional
140,And their recent launches are among the most successful launches in the entire marketplace
141,"And on top of that, for us, the great news are that they attract really new consumers that in the past we were attracting less,"
142,particularly Too Faced attract more younger consumers in our portfolio which is great extra business for the company overall
143,"And importantly, they have dramatically increased our penetration in Specialty Multi in the U.S"
144,"And this will continue internationally, which is a very important objective because as you all know, the Specialty Multi-Channel globally is one of the fastest growing channels in our sector"
145,I'll start with answering the ULTA question
146,So Clinique is very successful in the ULTA channel
147,"And what we have learned is that when Clinique is exposed with all the strengths of the core (32:42) portfolio and the strengths of services to a good growing traffic, the brand responds very, very well"
148,And Clinique is growing both makeup and skin care aggressively in every ULTA door in which the brand is deployed
149,"In terms of what we can learn for M•A•C – by the way, as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan to increase gradually the number of Clinique doors in ULTA in agreement with our retail partner"
150,"And, as far as the learning for M•A•C, absolutely we have learned a lot for perfecting our upcoming M•A•C execution; also from the Clinique experience"
151,"In particular, we have learned the importance of the service aspect, of making sure that the brand is deployed with all the necessarily SKU, assortment SKU, and decorations of the SKUs to the consumer, is the concept of a curated assortment that really fit the consumer, which has been a big learning that will be absolutely applied to every one of our brands"
152,"The good news, that is true for Clinique based on your question, but is true for every other – our three big brands"
153,We really attract new consumers and a lot of millennial consumers
154,"So the cannibalization is very, very limited"
155,"This consumer, our consumer that were not shopping in the brands before in a large majority, or they were lapsed brand users, because they were not anymore going in channels that – where the brands today are distributed"
156,So the large majority of the business is net extra business
157,"So on the total M•A•C growth, no"
158,We're not seeing a big change
159,"Overall, it's still between 4% and 5%; probably closer to 4% in this moment than to 5%, but still in the range"
160,And – but what we have seen a change – we see a change continuously is where the growth is coming from
161,"And the growth is coming from – by category – is coming more from makeup than in the past, as you know"
162,"And by recently, in this quarter, the growth is again coming from Asia more than in the previous quarters"
163,"And then, certain emerging markets have been more challenged than in the past, like, I don't know, Brazil or Turkey, obviously, and a few others"
164,"And so, we see a variation where the growth come from"
165,But what is interesting is actually the total growth is still between 4% and 5%
166,"So, let me start from this last question, is –"
167,"no, is what I said"
168,"You should not model it differently; is 25 by June and then 100, and you can assume that the 100 will be equally split, because it's a matter of capability opening"
169,"And the opening will be more aggressive as of September, obviously, because of organization and capability things"
170,But this is the total number that we're planning for at the moment
171,What was the?
172,"Ah, the earned media value of M•A•C"
173,"So what was driving the improvement of the earned media value of M•A•C is, first of all, the M•A•C activation of many more influencers"
174,"And the activation also of M•A•C makeup artist has influenced themselves, which is a unique model created by the M•A•C brand"
175,"Meaning M•A•C is, obviously, activity is external influencer, (39:17), but also, many of the very valuable makeup artists of M•A•C influence themselves"
176,"And being enabled by a lot of great quality asset to support to do this job around the world, and particularly in the U.S"
177,"The other thing is, activity in this, is M•A•C is back launching hero products"
178,"And as you know, a lot of these media value is driven by exciting new products"
179,"For example, Next to Nothing launch, which I mentioned in my prepared remark, is an activity which is creating a lot of conversation in the social media arena, which is helping support the brand"
180,We believe this strength will continue
181,The M•A•C brand is very active among the various changes they're leading in the U.S
182,market and internationally in increasing the numbers of hero products that will be passed of their deployed portfolio of innovation
183,"So, let me start from this line"
184,I think we said it in prepared remark and everywhere we comment on this new distribution
185,The new distribution is bringing new customers
186,And so we have absolute evidence
187,"That's why we have tested our way first with 30 doors, then in certain areas internationally, the same"
188,We have done this very gradually with a lot of attention
189,And there is – the large majority of consumers are new to the brands
190,"This is true for new distribution, both online in specialty and this is true for a lot of our new innovation which is focused on segments where we have strategic opportunities or strategic gaps"
191,And that's actually been the big strength
192,And the other information we – that I have already shared but
193,I want to further clarify it is that the large majority of these new consumers are millennials
194,And that's true in all these things that we have
195,"We have year-end data that comport all these learnings and then based on this data, we made decision on distribution evolutions around the world"
196,"And then in term of profit dilution of the new distribution, M•A•C is very dependent from traffic"
197,"And so if we – where we are able to create good sales per door, M•A•C is a profitable brand"
198,And so our priority is to stay focused on really making M•A•C a good brand with great sales per door in every single distribution channel and that will make M•A•C – will keep M•A•C as a very profitable brand
199,"And in term of the overall dynamic, I want again to clarify the – M•A•C exposure to, in this moment,"
200,the declining brick-and-mortar department store traffic is the key issue we are trying to solve
201,M•A•C has enormous demand and attention from consumers
202,It's a very desirable brand
203,"Wherever M•A•C is exposed to traffic, it's performing well"
204,And that's the key issue we are trying to work on
205,"As we said, we have many international pockets where M•A•C is booming"
206,And we need to address the U.S
207,issue as we have discussed
208,And I hope you see many of the pivoting activity that we are doing to achieve this goal as fast as possible
209,Our growth algorithm is 6% to 8% and we are obviously on this trend
210,And the key point is this industry is not a zero-sum game
211,All the big companies are growing
212,"And depending by quarter and by year, some are growing a bit less or a bit more, but we all are growing"
213,So the key point is that there is a strong category growth and there is space to grow for a lot of big companies
214,"And they believe that small brands are diluting the growth of big companies is clearly not demonstrated by the facts, because big companies are growing, are growing their brands and enriching their portfolios"
215,"If there are some smaller brands which are doing very well, some of them get acquired by the big companies when they have the right rate of return"
216,And so I believe actually this is an environment where many big companies can grow and can grow at the same time in this amazing part of the industry which is prestige beauty
217,"Now, what do I attribute in the short-term in the last six months, nine months?"
218,Our growth be below
219,some of our competitor is frankly 80% U.S
220,department store traffic
221,We are the company which has the highest exposure in percentage of our business and in our big brands to U.S
222,department store traffic
223,"And then there are other – many, many other areas of the world where frankly we are growing faster than many other companies"
224,"And the last point I want to make, we are building market share"
225,"So in a market we continue to grow 4% to 5%, we continue to grow market share"
226,This was evident also in the recent Unimonitor (52:02) report for 2016 calendar and is obviously proven by these first quarter numbers where we are growing in constant currency 9% versus the market which is probably closer to 4%
227,So we keep growing market share
228,"We keep growing well in all over the world and we do have an issue to solve – to address, which is that U.S"
229,department store traffic and our high penetration of this channel
230,And we are pivoting to reinforce this channel and at the same time diversify our business in the needed way
231,Okay
232,So let's start again
233,M•A•C is – there've been some recent research issued that M•A•C is the number one brand loved by teenagers in this market in the U.S
234,", and just been published a research on this"
235,"All our consumer data showed that M•A•C is among the preferred brands among the millennials and, frankly, all generations"
236,So M•A•C is a business built to be really very sensitive to traffic
237,And that's the key thing we need to do
238,"The brand is in excellent shape, very desirable"
239,"And as I said, to demonstrate this, there are markets around the world where the brand this quarter has been growing 40% or 45%, despite the competition being the same"
240,And so it's a very specific opportunity
241,"Said that, there is definitely a lot of new competition, and every big brand has to face this new competition"
242,"On this, I would like to make an – to do an observation"
243,"What we see in the data is that this increasing competition, done by an ever-increasing number of brands, is an increasing competition in the momental (55:06) trial"
244,"That is, we don't see increasing competition in the area of loyalty and in the area of retention and repeat, which where the profit is"
245,Let me explain this
246,"We have, for example, in all our big brands, take Estée Lauder with Advanced Night Repair, take M•A•C with Studio Fix, the big hero products in this moment are getting more success and increased repeat, despite the increased competition"
247,"What is tougher is to get the attention at the trial moment, because of the many small brands , there's more activity out there (55:42)"
248,But I would like you to think that the trial moment is not the profitable moment
249,Trial is an investment
250,Repeat is a profit
251,"And so at the end, the profitable brands are still the big brands with great hero product, great repeat, and not many small brands that generate a lot of noise on trial, because unless they get the repeat, they will not be sustainable"
252,"And so, we are very focused on a sustainable, long-term profitability strategy for our brands, and that's the way we are addressing the issue at M•A•C and the opportunity for all our brands"
253,"So, the second question was specialty-multi, which is an opportunity for many of our brands, and I mentioned many of them in my prepared remarks, exactly to give you maximum exposure to all the pivoting we're doing"
254,"Instead of repeating them, I would like just to clarify one point"
255,Every brand has a unique distribution strategy in the Estée Lauder Company portfolio
256,"So, we don't do things by channel"
257,We do things by brand
258,"So, there are brands which are designed to win well in specialty, brands which are designed to be in multiple channels, and brands that are designed to be more exclusive in a certain channel type"
259,And our broad portfolio brands give us the possibility to play this growing multichannel portfolio globally in an excellent strategic way
260,"The last question was on online, and yes, we see a very different pattern in purchases online"
261,"Purchases online tend to be younger and tend to be, frankly, very profitable, because consumers are very loyal when they get into it"
262,There's a lot of good repeat
263,"But most importantly, the online sales allow us to reach consumers that sometimes we cannot reach with brick and mortar"
264,This is particularly true in emerging markets
265,"I just gave the good example of China, where a good launch of M•A•C in Tmall that will happen this quarter, we know, by all our analysis, that will expose millions of Chinese consumers in cities of Tier 3 or Tier 4, that today cannot buy the brand, to be able to buy the brand"
266,"This is true for many other brands in our portfolio, and many of our online activities around the world"
267,Okay
268,"I'll start from the Lauder and Clinique question, and Tracey will take over"
269,"So, first of all, Lauder is growing, so it's not stabilized"
270,"Lauder has been growing in a very exciting way, in my opinion, this quarter"
271,And this is the second quarter in a row where the Lauder brand is growing globally
272,"What is driving that is successful innovation that is hitting new consumers, combined with an amazing work on relaunching hero products, and that's the key point"
273,"I mean, Double Wear is a fantastic foundation product that millions of consumers around the world love"
274,"But still, there are millions of consumer that never tried this product"
275,"And so, the ability of the brand to continue win with winning hero products is the key learning, and this is working very well"
276,"And, for example, we have learned that Double Wear in specialty-multi attracts Millennials, despite being a foundation that's been there for many years, and being a fantastic product for many years, attract new Millennials to the brand better than maybe specific Millennial launches targeted to Millennial"
277,So we are now ready to leverage these new discoveries on Lauder and continue the acceleration
278,"The third thing which is helping the Lauder brand is that the Lauder brand is more exposed, positively exposed, to the Chinese consumers and to the Asian dynamics than the Clinique brand, for example"
279,The Clinique brand in the country is more exposed to U.S
280,department store than any other brand in our portfolio together with M•A•C U.S
281,"But globally, Clinique is more exposed in total"
282,"So the key point is that Lauder benefited from the comeback of growth in Asia and it being part of one of the brands, driving the comeback of skin care in Asia"
283,"And so the research of Asia, Asia skin care is obviously helping the Lauder brand and in our opinion will continue to grow – to support the growth of the Lauder brand"
284,"The learning for Clinique are the same, is more hero products, more activity on innovation that on top of building specific new products, build existing hero products, the Pressed Fresh Vitamin C launch is an example of that"
285,"Vitamin C is a new product per se, but at the same time create regimen with existing moisturizer of Clinique and so sell and build hero products"
