80,Many international department store continue to generate very healthy growth especially those in high traffic touristic destinations like Harrods or Selfridges in London where our business is robust
81,"In several other markets such as China or Italy, department stores are delivering strong gains"
82,Our biggest challenge has been in some U.S
83,"brick-and-mortar department stores, which are struggling from falling foot traffic especially in smaller malls and touristic driven doors"
84,department store represents approximately 17% of our global sales last year
85,And we are encouraged by new signs of strength in some retailers’ top doors
86,"We will leverage debt activity by improving our merchandising, our service, our communication, and our sampling and we are also collaborating with U.S"
87,"department stores to boost that business online, which is growing strongly"

95,by fiscal year-end
96,Clinique has enjoyed good momentum in China and travel retail in recent months in recent response to new launches such as Fresh Pressed Serum with pure vitamin C and we believe its results will also improve
97,We will continue to reallocate resources and add talents to our social media programs which have become a critical component of beauty marketing
98,Our brands are aligning with authentic and locally relevant influencers and amplifying their storytelling to ensure that their content is differentiated and memorable
99,Consumers are purchasing beauty products more frequently than in the past partly because they can quickly and easily order online
100,"This is especially true for our hero products and franchises, which generate more triumph in bringing new consumer as well as repeat business, which is more profitable"
101,We have robust cadence of launches planned with an emphasis on strengthening core franchises
102,"As an example, Estée Lauder just introduced Advanced Night Repair eye concentrate matrix which incorporates innovative technology and has been well received"
103,"It also launched a new formula of its best-selling Double Wear foundation, which is a top recruiting product in many markets, attracting both millennials and ageless consumers"
104,Foundations are a large and high loyalty subcategory and many other brands like Clinique are introducing new formulas
105,It’s Even Better glow makeup is off to a strong start
106,MAC
107,Next to Nothing lightweight foundation is a departure from the brand’s full coverage makeups and should continue to be a strong recruitment product this year
108,"In skin care, La Mer is rolling out two new types of moisturizer to support its iconic Crème de La Mer product lineup including a lotion with a matte finish and we expect a strong consumer response"
109,"Clinique launched Fresh Pressed serum and a supercharged version of Moisture Surge a few months ago, each to terrific perception and they should continue to be a major sales driver for the brand this year"

114,"I want to thank our global employees and my executive team for their leadership and ability to effectively execute change across the organization, which is an important competitive advantage for our company"
115,We are fortunate to operate in a highly desirable industry they are focused on the many opportunities in our future
116,We are confident in our ability to win
117,"We will achieve our goals by leveraging our successful strategy that is based on multiple engine of growth, a well-diversified business, superior talent and creativity and unmatched product quality and branding"
118,"As we have shown this past year, we are executing our change agenda with excellence and speed"
119,"As we drive our momentum, we will continue to embrace a changing landscape, push the boundaries of possibility and pivot to tomorrow’s opportunity as consumer preferences evolve"
120,"As I mentioned, we are instilling a digital-first mind-set throughout our company"
121,And now Dennis McEniry who has led our online business for the past 17 years will discuss this exciting area
122,Dennis?
123,"And on the contour of the cadence, in fact, the activity also – the base of the second six months would be stronger than the base of the first six months"
124,"As you remember, we had the first quarter last year at plus 2%, 3%"
125,And so that’s the other factor that we would need to expect
126,"So in our estimate, we do expect a stronger top line in the first six months from the second six months"
127,"But we expect also very strong and solid second six months and as we said, a 7% to 8% for the year"
128,"On the second question, on your question on Amazon, I mean, we distribute into brand-building distribution, which exercise the key drivers of our prestige beauty including High-Touch services"
129,And so we are ready to distribute in channels where those criterias are fully respected
130,We do distribute in some global e-commerce platforms like Tmall where those criterias are respected
131,"At this point we do not distribute in Amazon, and in our fiscal year 2018 plan and estimates, there is no distribution in Amazon included"
132,"Yes, no, absolutely, no"
133,We are really strongly collaborating with our partners in department store to increase traffic
134,And I mentioned that – but I mentioned merchandising
135,"We are relooking at merchandising activity and we are relooking at our counters, at our system of engagements in store, and we are making some progress, in my opinion"
136,"But obviously most importantly is the way innovation gets executed, and the way social media gets executed on the innovation is also an important element to contribute to traffic building again"
137,"The third big factor, we are working very aggressively with our partners with online"
138,"And they’re making excellent progress online, and we are making on our business very good progress on e-commerce with them as well, and that’s also important"
139,"The other important thing that e-commerce is increasing the frequency of purchase of our consumers because their repurchase is readily available, and sometimes in the past, people would have waited to repurchase their regular preferred product to the next visit"
140,Now they don’t need to wait
141,So basically all the gaps of people in usage or repeated usage of product are being filled by the user online
142,"That’s also very true also in the department store channel, and we are leveraging this reality"
143,"We are seeing some initial progress in the strong doors, and as I said in my prepared remark, the problem remains in the smaller malls where traffic for the moment is not yet strong"
144,But I’m optimistic that we may see – we may have in front of us a moment of improvement in this area in fiscal year 2018.
145,"So on the first question, as I said, all of our brand – our company is 100% focused on prestige luxury beauty, meaning that all of our brands without exception are distributed in brand-building distribution proven to have all the driver of prestige"
146,So there will not be exception for brands like – any brand
147,"And Clinique, by the way, is very much a key prestige brand in our portfolio"
148,"On Asia, yes, 40% is a big number, so I’m not going to say 40% is sustainable"
149,But a double-digit continuous growth in this moment looks very sustainable because there are several dynamics that are playing in the China situation
150,"First of all, the growth in China is depending a lot from the lower import duty that’s been passed on to pricing into the local product"
151,This has pushed the market
152,Then the second big dynamic is that the Chinese consumers are passionate about makeup and fragrances more and more
153,So China historically was really driven by skincare
154,"Today, China is driven by three engines, two of which on a very dynamic growth"
155,"So this is proven by our retail growth in quarter four, where we had for example"
156,"some brands like MAC that just doubled the business in one quarter now, obviously helped by the team who launched"
157,"But still, the growth in the same-door brick-and-mortar was outstanding, and the same for our Bobbi Brown and the same for our Estée Lauder makeup, where historically Estée Lauder was very successful on skincare only is now adding a very important leg in makeup"
158,"This phenomenon is going to continue, in our opinion, and that’s why it would be sustainable"
159,"Third point in China, we see growth from department store, from Sephora, from freestanding store, from online; it’s really across"
160,and it’s
161,across all the cities
162,We are in 170 cities
163,"When we look at our online sales, where the purchases come from, an enormous amount of these purchases come from cities we do not operate in brick-and-mortar, which makes the distribution in China efficient, but also the opportunity to grow new consumers come from cities where we do not operate today"
164,"And then finally, the portfolio fragrance is going to get traction for the industry and for us, particularly Jo Malone and Tom Ford at this point"
165,So I believe there is a lot of traction and a lot of fundamentals in China in this moment which is very strong
166,"Now, you asked about Korean brands"
167,"Yes, in this moment Korean brands in China are weaker than usual and this may not be the sustainable part of the story"
168,"But that’s why I wanted first to explain the sustainable part of the story because I believe that even when the Korea brands demand had to stabilize, I think we will continue to see good traction in China"
169,MAC U.S
170,"is improving, that has still been declining in the last quarter"
171,"So our expectation is that the brand will improve by better innovation, stronger social media, improvement in store and obviously activities, which are about the assortment and the marketing plans of the brand, which are in evolution to better match the consumer expectation and the consumer evolution"
172,"And also the distribution, MAC is still very much exposed in the U.S"
173,to the foot traffic of brick-and-mortar department stores
174,And so this will be for some time
175,And so we will – we are working to improve MAC trend in the U.S
176,as well
177,"But for the moment, we are assuming that MAC in the U.S"
178,will get the majority of the improvement from the marketing I said and from the ULTA distribution that I quoted in my prepared remarks
179,The rest of the benefit will come from the international business
180,"Most importantly, I want to underline that MAC online in the U.S"
181,", as was explained in the prepared remark of Dennis, grew 29% last year and we are expecting this to continue"
182,"So in summary, better marketing, better in-store activities, more social media, ULTA distributions, strong online are the positives that should create the improvements of MAC"
183,And we are for the moment not assuming an enormous improvement in the brick-and-mortar department store part in our estimates
184,but we are working on it actively
185,I’ll start with – to say your question is if the consumer will get accustomed to promotion
186,"I mean, they are –"
187,"consumers are segmented, and there are certain consumers that do wait for promotional opportunities to buy and this is not new"
188,This has always been the case
189,And there are other consumers that don’t
190,"But on average, I just want to make you think that the growing part of the business is the non-promoted one"
191,And the growing – the fastest-growing channels are the channels that promote the least
192,"And so in total, I would say that prestige beauty is from a consumer standpoint is an industry that need a moderate amount of promotions"
193,And then where there are excessive promotions is a short-term event that generally doesn’t generate a change in consumer behaviors
194,And then I think Tracey will address Leading Beauty Forward
195,So I’m not sure I understand completely the question
196,"But no, we don’t see any change in the dynamic of the industry"
197,"Actually, let me take the opportunity to explain one important thing"
198,"Obviously, the industry is based on trial and repurchase"
199,What the change of the last few years is that the trial activity has become more competitive
200,"There are more brands that have been in some cases promotions, they’ve been more active"
201,"And so, the world of trial has become more competitive"
202,But the world of trial tends to be an investment
203,"The world of repurchase, loyalty, actually has not changed a lot"
204,"The loyalty level on our brands are improving in some cases, stable in others"
205,The repurchase rate remains very high for our hero SKUs
206,"So, what’s happening is that the repurchase is still driven by product quality and by product performance and by brand loyalty"
207,And those things are not changing much less
208,"Now, it happened that the majority of the profitability is in the repurchase gain"
209,"And so, the brands and the companies that own the repurchase gain are owning more of the profit and more of the cash"
210,"And the trial gain which is becoming more competitive is what we are all reacting to, improving our social media activation, our innovation, our activation in-store and all the rest"
211,"Promotion is only one element of how this is evolving and, frankly, not the biggest one in my opinion"
212,"So, on stats and then Tracey, you take SMI"
213,"So, on Clinique"
214,Clinique is growing in Asia
215,Clinique is growing in Europe
216,Clinique is growing in Latin America
217,I’ll ask Dennis in a second to speak about Clinique online
218,Fresh Pressed has been a success
219,There are several aspect in the Clinique business which is growing
220,Clinique in brick-and-mortar U.S
221,department store is declining
222,"And since this is still an important part of Clinique business, obviously, this is offsetting some of the positive moments"
223,"Sorry, then you asked about specialty, Clinique is growing in specialty in the U.S"
224,"Dennis, on online?"
225,Yes
226,"And then on MAC again, as I said before, I already answered the question on what type of positive signs from MAC which is, MAC international and MAC online, ULTA, MAC in the U.S"
227,", the improvements in MAC marketing activity, et cetera"
228,"But yes, the two areas of MAC which are still taking the brand down are brick-and-mortar brand store and freestanding store U.S"
229,But freestanding store outside of the U.S
230,keep growing profitably
231,"So, those are the two areas where we are working to further turn around the MAC However, to be clear, the expectation in fiscal year 2018 is MAC to grow because between the positive and these two areas still to be fixed, the positive are much bigger than these two areas still to be fixed"
232,"Yes, I would like to take the opportunity of this question to make one thing noticeable, that we have double-digit growth in many of these channels"
233,"But if you just take the combination of travel retail, specialty-multi, online, you arrive, just with these three, at well about one-third of the company"
234,"And this is growing very strongly and very double-digit, more than 20% each one of these channels, et cetera"
235,"So, we are in a situation from a channel diversification that we have more than one-third of the company growing in the high-20s"
236,"and that’s very, very strong"
237,"So, the channel mix is actually a great point of our strategy of multiple engines of growth and diversification and is one of the key element which is building momentum"
238,"So, yes, in our plans, there is a stabilization of the U.S"
239,business without BECCA and Too Faced and absolutely
240,That’s what we are aiming for and working for
241,"And the second question, we believe that we can open more distribution points than what will be closed"
242,"And so, this will be – is in our numbers"
243,There’s still a net improvement of consumer reach in our plans
244,"So, freestanding – go, go"
245,"In terms of innovation, we have one of the strongest innovation pipelines"
246,"As I said in my prepared remarks, the innovation in fiscal 2018 will be also very focused on reinforcing the existing very strong franchises which are in all brands –"
247,"Too Faced, Peach or Better Than Sex, Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, Clinique taking the Fresh Pressed concept to the next level, et cetera, et cetera"
248,"So, there is a lot of buildup"
249,"You are now going to see one blockbuster which is a high-return, high-risk"
250,"You’re going to see every brand to have three, five, big serious initiative well-focused by category"
251,"And the portfolio of innovation of the company to cover all the opportunity by sub-category and region in a much more sophisticated way than we did in the past, thanks to better analytic and better preplanning"
252,"Frankly, this is very small"
253,"I mean, only one small fragrance brand is really in these impairment"
254,And then one very small brand that was part of the acquisition before
255,"And most of the other brands are growing double-digit, triple-digit, out of our [indiscernible] where we’re including the small brands where we have an impairment on"
256,They are all growing double-digit or triple-digit
257,"And in the case of the impairment, it actually is a timing issue"
258,"So, frankly, no"
259,We believe our acquisitions have been very successful and there is only one brand that has a small delay which in the context of the many acquisition that we have done is frankly not relevant
260,"We are very satisfied with acquisition and we believe that BECCA and Too Faced and the other acquisition we have done particularly in the fragrances, or GLAMGLOW for example, are extremely successful and will continue to be a big part of our growth"
