134,"Good morning, Chris"
135,"Yes, sure"
136,"Thanks, John"
137,I’ll give you – try to answer as many of those questions I can as a lot rolled up there
138,"Clearly, it’s a competitive environment right now as new players entered the U.S"
139,as emerging channels like e-commerce come on to the scene
140,"So definitely, it’s competitive both on the retailer side, as well as the manufacturer side"
141,"What I can tell you is, I feel really good about our ability to compete in this environment"
142,Where we’re big in the U.S
143,", we’re one of the top food companies"
144,"We have scale across center store, refrigerated and frozen"
145,"And as we grow the categories of our retailers growth, so again, it’s important that we have good plans locked in with our retailers"
146,"In addition to that, we’ve got one of the best sales forces as ranked by Cantor in the industry"
147,They’re doing a great job of really sitting down with the retailers and putting together joint business plans
148,And what we find with those joint business plans is trade-offs
149,"And again, even across a retailer, we might give a bit one category to get something in return in another"
150,"But by applying our scale, and again, if we’re growing broadly, that’s really good for our retailers category"
151,We’re finding a way to get to win-win solution
152,"So, again, there’s a lot going on"
153,"And certainly, space optimization,"
154,that’s something that we’re seeing as well
155,"What I’d tell you there is, we have some businesses that are going to win in that"
156,"So we have a broad snacking portfolio, which will likely win in that environment in addition to that natural organic’s core strength of ours as well with the third largest national organic player in the country, so that’s good"
157,And in the categories that might contract
158,"What we tend to see is that, the smaller manufacturers the third or fourth or fifth players tend to be the ones that lose"
159,And when you look at our business in the U.S
160,", 80% of our brands are the number one or number two in their category"
161,So it’s tough out there for sure
162,"But at the same time, I actually feel like, we’re in a place now that we can be advantaged and really win in this marketplace"
163,Thank you
164,Yes
165,"Sure, Matthew, this is Jon"
166,"What I can tell you is that, we really like the way that we’re competing in the cereal category right now"
167,"When you look at our performance through the first-half, our change in trend is pretty significant and nearly 70% of that change is from baseline sales"
168,"So, again, it’s really better innovation and better marketing"
169,"that’s driving our results in the category, and that’s really been the recipe for success in the category over the long-term"
170,"So we’re very committed to, again, continue to build strong brands and then innovate more aggressively"
171,and we feel really good about the pipeline as we look forward
172,"As you think about the category, it’s still a big category, important category is the fourth largest class across grocery"
173,And we believe and it’s highly penetrated 90% of households consume cereal
174,So we really believe in the category
175,We think there’s growth ahead
176,There are some interesting timing of things
177,"So again, if you think about the category grew nicely during the financial downturn"
178,"So between 2007 and 2012, the category grew"
179,"As the economy gradually got better and out of home eating increased, we saw the category tip the negative"
180,So we’re starting to see that moderate in terms of the in-home versus out-of-home
181,"We also know that, 30% of consumption of the category comes from boomers and older adults and that group of consumers are going to grow"
182,So we absolutely believe in the category
183,We believe that strong marketing and good innovation can drive it
184,We’re committed to doing our part
185,and we look forward to again driving our growth as we move to the back-half and into the future
186,You too
187,"Sure, sure"
188,So a couple of things
189,"One, we really like the way we’re competing across categories"
190,"And again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’re seeing broad-based improvement across the majority of our categories and we like the way we’re competing across channels"
191,It’s really is broad-based better as well
192,"We feel like we’re winning in the majority of our channels, so that feels really good"
193,"As we think about share, again, the thing that gives us good confidence that we’re heading in the right direction here is the majority of our change and improvement in trend is really coming from baseline sales"
194,"So, again, across total U.S"
195,"retail, 75% of our improvement is via baseline sales"
196,"So it’s really not a case of merchandising driving the bulk of our improvement, so it’s better marketing"
197,"And as I mentioned in my remarks, we made a pretty major change last year shifting long relationships with advertising agencies moving to some new ones"
198,and we really like that trend that we see in market
199,and we know that is driving our business and our baselines and our innovations
200,are better
201,", it’s up 50% year-over-year"
202,And I can tell you that’s actually off the same number of items
203,"So, again, it’s not turning much stuff out there"
204,", it’s actually better quality"
205,So we’re really focused on competing
206,We’re focused on the fundamentals
207,"And we believe that if we continue to do that, we can continue to see broad-based wins across our business"
208,"Again, we feel good generally across the majority of the channels"
209,"And again, without calling off specific customers, there’s this puts and takes"
210,"But the reality is, we’re growing share across all channels"
211,"And I think for us right now, that’s the focus to compete wherever we are"
212,So I’m not going to – there’s not one that jumps out of me
213,"Again, we feel really good about how we’re trending in all of them"
214,I’ll give you a few thoughts on Wii
215,"So, again, we’re really pleased with the results there"
216,It’s about 1.5 share of the category already
217,We expect that to continue to increase
218,"And for year one, again, we expect this to be in north of $100 million in sales"
219,"So, again, it’s off to a terrific start"
220,"We’re seeing really good repeat rates and consumers are telling us that they view us very, very unique"
221,"In terms of how we got there, I’m really proud of we"
222,"And again, let me just start by saying, we know there’s a lot more work to be done in yogurt"
223,"So we’re not taking any victory laps in that category, to be clear"
224,"But I like the way that, that seems really operating"
225,They’re focused on playing our game and then looking for opportunities and segments that are going to be growing in the future and bringing fundamental innovation
226,"And we did it in a really scrappy way, innovating quickly and closely with consumers is"
227,truly is consumer-first innovation
228,"And by being in market and iterating over time, we’ve got to a product that we know really resonates with consumers really works hard"
229,"So the actual process that we used to create, we were actually moving across overall use in the U.S"
230,", really around the world to make sure that we move more quickly and make sure that we’re connected as closely to the consumer as we can"
231,And we believe that’s going to help our pipeline as we move forward and make our innovation even more impactful
232,"Sure, Steve"
233,"The categories through key season is growing, so that’s good overall"
234,"And, again, for the rest of the strong share, which we like"
235,Similar to some of the other businesses what we really like that 80% of our improvement in trend in soup is actually coming from baseline sales
236,"So, again, it’s fundamentals, it’s"
237,good marketing
238,"Now we’ve got a little bit of innovation with the progress of organics, it’s"
239,working for us as well
240,"So, again, like many of the other categories, it’s about fundamentals and competing well"
241,"And if we do that, we think that we can be successful and drive the category"
242,"And again, through key season, we’re seeing the category grow"
243,and it appears to be healthy
244,and we’re having good constructive conversations with the retailers around it
245,So we’d expect continued growth through the back-half of the year
