12,"Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store's profitability this quarter: declining turkey prices, increased expenses and increased competition"

61,"While it is early in the year, our assessment of the impact of turkey prices at seven-year lows creates challenges for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the total company's full-year outlook, despite expected growth in other segments"
62,"As such, we are adjusting our full-year guidance to $1.65 to $1.71 per share"
63,We are confident in the balance we have purposely built into our business and expect strong performance from our other segments to overcome the market headwinds at Jennie-O Turkey Store
64,"At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017."
65,"Morning, Farha"
66,"Farha, Jim Snee here"
67,"We do already purchase some meat on the outside, and we do have flexibility at times"
68,But our production cycle is a relatively long production cycle
69,So the flexibility doesn't really allow you to capitalize on all of that opportunity
70,"But certainly, our team is looking at that and watching those market dynamics and taking advantage of it as they can"
71,"Sure, Farha"
72,We're very active on the M&A front
73,"And like most quarters, we feel good about the pipeline we have"
74,"For us, the biggest issue continues to be getting it across the finish line"
75,That's always the most difficult part
76,"But as we think about what we are focused on, the need to become more global, businesses or items that afford us the opportunity to become more healthy, holistic, on-the-go, multicultural are all things that are squarely in our wheelhouse"
77,"And then we also, of course, are looking for those right opportunities that will add scale or support existing businesses with the idea that we want businesses that are margin accretive, that are one or two in the categories where they compete, and we want to make sure that we're bringing more than just a check that we really can add value to the business"
78,But I think the important thing to understand is that Fred and his team are very active
79,"The pipeline is full, and we'll continue to work hard in that area"
80,"So, Adam, as we put together our new guidance, on the JOTS side of the business, we do expect in Q2 to see similar decreases that we saw in the first quarter, and of course in half two, we're calling for mid-single digit declines for JOTS"
81,"We don't feel like we're being overly optimistic there, we are taking a realistic look at the business"
82,"We do expect stronger performance in Refrigerated Foods have very strong value-added sales, we expect that to continue"
83,"Specialty Foods group, the business and CytoSport which, of course, includes Muscle Milk, continues to perform well"
84,So we are expecting stronger performance throughout the year
85,"And then, Grocery Products have seen a lot of good sales momentum, we expect that to continue"
86,"International, same thing"
87,"So, we are expecting that those two business units will meet expectations"
88,"And then as we said, when we roll that all up, it's really â€“ what we tout is our balanced business model that will offset some of those challenging market conditions for JOTS"
89,"Adam, we did â€“ that your number is right and for us"
90,what it is the seasonality in the business
91,"And we learned through the rollout â€“ our innovative SKIPPY PB bites items, that once you get past Halloween, there are some seasonality, downturn in the confectionary business"
92,"So, it wasn't totally unexpected"
93,But we are on track for the $100 million and the $0.01 EPS accretion this year
94,So feel really good
95,"I think at its core, the volume for Justin's year-over-year was up 20%"
96,So the business is doing quite well
97,"Good morning, Jeremy"
98,I don't know if we've ever said that ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge
99,They obviously have a very strong position
100,Our position has been that we've seen growth in ground turkey because it continues to be on trend for consumers
101,And we expect over time that we are going to see growth in the share
102,We're going to see growth in the category
103,"Obviously, in any given quarter or any given year you run the risk of the supply cycle, and I think that's what's happened here"
104,"Obviously, from a pricing perspective, we've seen some discounts"
105,The one thing that I would point out is that our tray pack volume was still very strong for the quarter
106,The tray pack volume was up 15%
107,And so that tells us that the product is on trend with consumers
108,"But ground beef is certainly going to be a challenge for us as we continue, but we feel like we've got the right product connecting with the right consumers"
109,"As we looked at the rollup, Jeremy, we really feel like we've done a deep assessment of the business, and this is a realistic outlook for the business"
110,"We've got some good strong sales growth even in the first quarter in retail, foodservice, deli"
111,"But the fact is there is competition out there, and we understand that"
112,We understand the market dynamics
113,"And so we feel like this guidance is a very realistic look, not only at JOTS, but all of the business segments"
114,"That's a hard one, Jeremy"
115,"And we've talked about that a lot in terms of when we've been asked the question about what does it mean to you, one of the things we have responded with is tell us when"
116,"And so once we know when this is all going to happen, we'll be able to give you a better answer"
117,And I think labor certainly is one of the variables that comes into the mix
118,"From our perspective, clearly, we've got a great long-term workforce in many of our facilities, so we're well positioned"
119,And so we will be watching the timing of these plants coming online very closely and trying to better understand what that means
120,"Sure, Heather"
121,"From our perspective, as Jim Sheehan described earlier, we did see a spike in belly prices, and we took appropriate pricing action"
122,"It's going to take a little while to work through the system, but we feel really good about our ability to continue to take pricing in that category"
123,"We've also seen some competitive pricing action in that category as well, which bodes well, we believe, for our future, especially in bacon"
124,"In Refrigerated Foods also, let's not forget about our strong foodservice business"
125,"They had another great quarter in the first quarter, and there's no signs of that business slowing down"
126,So we feel really good about that
127,"And so the second quarter should be a good quarter for Refrigerated Foods, and that's what's leading us to say we do expect it to be a stronger performance for the full year"
128,"Heather, I would say it's pretty consistent across retail, foodservice, and deli"
129,"Good morning, Ken"
130,"First thing, obviously, is we're looking out the balance of the year driven by JOTS"
131,"As we get throughout the year, we'll be able to take a closer look at that, but it is early for us to be looking out into 2018 and 2019."
132,"Okay, thanks for the clarification, Ken"
133,I don't think that it structurally changes our business going forward
134,We're obviously in a market cycle
135,That cycle will correct
136,"And when we think about JOTS in particular, from our perspective, we know that there's history here"
137,History has been on our side
138,"We've seen this in 2003 and in the 2008, 2009 timeframe"
139,"In each case, we've emerged stronger"
140,We know that it's important for us to stay disciplined
141,"And JOTS, as you know, it's a key part of our balanced model and a key part of our business"
142,"So in terms of structural change, we don't see it, we just have to get through this cycle and we will"
143,"Sure, Akshay"
144,Jim Snee
145,"So the first part around competition and competitive pressure, I mean, we are seeing it in the markets, or in the meats, as you say, and we are also seeing it from competitors"
146,We're not the only company that was coming back out of AI looking to regain distribution and regain business
147,So there is an element of market pressure and competitive set pressure
148,So we are seeing that on both sides
149,"And then when we think about the next piece when you talk about expenses, Jim Sheehan referenced some of the bird performance on the live production side and we know that those are cycles and our team, again, coming out of AI is already working on addressing that in the live production side of the business"
150,So competition does have both parts
151,The expenses with bird performance
152,"The other thing that we mentioned, which is going to be a very good thing for us over the long-term is our venture into raised without antibiotics"
153,"And right now, obviously, we're making investments in that business"
154,We know that it's the right thing to do
155,"And that includes feed, supply chain densities"
156,There's a lot of things too that go into that
157,"And then the last thing, Akshay, and I want to make this part just clear on your opening comment"
158,We are not projecting $100 million decline year-on-year for Jennie-O Turkey Store
159,"We would expect it to be less than that, more â€“ maybe half of that"
160,"Akshay, we saw that release earlier this week as well"
161,"Obviously, chicken has been in that space for a long time"
162,And so it's too early to tell
163,"We haven't seen the product, haven't really heard what the consumers think, haven't heard what retailers think"
164,So it's really too early to tell on that specific product line
165,But clearly we'll be watching it closely
166,"Thanks, Akshay"
167,Really we've got stronger performance for the balance of the year in both Refrigerated and Specialty Foods
168,"On the Refrigerated side, the big driver there is going to be continued strong value-added sales both on the retail side of the business and continued strong performance from our foodservice team"
169,"And then on the Specialty Foods side, like we said, the CytoSport business continues to do well gaining distribution, but also some great, new innovative items that are really starting to take hold in the marketplace"
170,"So between those two things, that's really what's going to offset some of the difficult market conditions for JOTS"
171,"Yes, Sean"
172,Jim Snee
173,That's a fair statement
174,"Really in terms of expenses, obviously, advertising was up on the quarter"
175,"There, as you would expect, were expenses associated with the Justin's integration that are one-time expenses"
176,So certainly advertising will play a benefit for the rest of the year
177,"We won't have the ongoing integration charges, but the bigger driver in all of this is really the sales momentum for Grocery Products"
178,And so SKIPPY continues to do really well
179,Our MegaMex portfolio of products is doing well
180,And then we do see some favorable market conditions that will help them out and then again the full year benefit of Justin's
181,So that's really what's driving our outlook for Grocery Products
182,"I think, Sean, we've talked a lot about the continued growth, the migration up the value ladder, if you will, in our Refrigerated Foods segment, and it occurs not just in packaged items"
183,"We're doing it across the entire Refrigerated Foods organization, in fresh pork, in meat products"
184,It's happening everywhere
185,"And so we'll continue to work on that, and we've been very successful"
186,"The other part to really consider is the, once again, strong growth of our foodservice business"
187,That's a business that continue to deliver quite well for our organization
188,We don't expect that to slow down
189,And then a lot of the innovation work that we are doing in on-the-go with our party trays and
190,some of our other items that we've developed
191,So is it a structural difference?
192,"It certainly is a structural shift, and we will continue to be working on that so that we do eliminate volatility over the long-term"
193,Sure
194,"Thanks, Rob"
195,"So to your first question, the answer is yes"
196,"We are committed to that long-term margin guidance, and clearly the impact of Jennie-O on just this one quarter moved us back a little bit"
197,But we do believe that this business is going to rebound and will emerge stronger
198,and it's going to be a key part of that journey in the margin improvement
199,So the answer is yes
200,We are committed to that
201,"And to your second question, certainly there are elements of both, right?"
202,"I think we are still probably gaining back some distribution, but you're gaining back distribution because there's consumer demand"
203,"And so again, the underlying fundamental there is we feel really good about the business"
204,", it's connecting with consumers and it's on trend, and we expect to continue to do that"
205,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
206,LLC
207,"Okay, thank you"
208,"Sure, Rupesh"
209,"Good morning, Jim Snee"
210,"Yeah, just following up on the earlier question around Justin's, the $13 million in the first quarter does account for some seasonality in the business in the whole confectionary space"
211,But we do want to point out that the volume is up 20% year over year
212,And so we do believe that we're on track for $100 million for the full year and still remain very positive about that acquisition and that business going forward
213,"And as you get to the Applegate business, our team there continues to work through the rebound of the supply situation, both on the pork side, and then that was compounded with turkey supply shortages through AI"
214,"And as you think of that business in specific parts of the store, the walled deli space is extremely competitive"
215,"The team's making progress there, but that's been a battle"
216,Really a lot of continued success in the meat case and the freezer
217,"Hot dogs, dinner sausage, the nuggets, the chicken breakfast sausage, those items are doing well"
218,And we're working now on developing business in the foodservice channel as well
219,So we think that that business is very healthy and going to continue to do well
220,Sure
221,"Eric, good morning, Jim Snee"
222,Thanks for those questions
223,I'll try to break those down here
224,So the first one around avocados â€“ and you are correct
225,We have taken pricing increases on Wholly Guacamole
226,"And those prices have been in the marketplace a little while now, but consumer demand remains strong for the products"
227,"In terms of the avocado market, there are a couple of things"
228,"Prices are historically high, but they are down from some of their October peaks"
229,The other thing to understand is that there is adequate supply
230,"And so we have a number of â€“ or a lot of the supply that comes out of Mexico, but we have other sources for supply as well"
231,So there's adequate supply in that space
232,And we again feel really good about the business going forward
233,"From a Grocery Products perspective, our guidance is consistent with what we laid out in the fourth quarter call"
234,"And so the business is very healthy, a lot of sales momentum"
235,"And you're right, once you get through some of these one-time expenses, we'll be able to deliver the guidance we laid out"
236,"And yeah, there is a mix shift (53:56), a mix shift as we think about the Justin's and SKIPPY and all of those product lines that really continue to build a nice broad base in the Grocery Products portfolio"
237,So we feel really good about what Grocery Products is doing and where they're headed
238,"Hi, Mario"
239,I think we're on track for the 5% organic growth number
240,"As you go around all of the different business segments, Refrigerated Foods, the strong value-added sales will continue to deliver there"
241,JOTS will be slightly lower
242,"We are going to see some volume growth, but obviously we understand the market conditions"
243,Specialty Foods will continue to perform well
244,"And then International, Grocery Products are all on track for what we said they were going to do"
245,"So we do believe, Mario, that we're going to be able to deliver that 5% organic number"
246,"I mean, I think, we've said our stronger performance will come from Refrigerated and Specialty, but there's some really nice sales momentum in Grocery Products, and we don't expect that to slow down"
247,"Thanks, Mario"
248,"Specialty Foods, you've got to remember that that's still a mix of CytoSport, HHL and our Specialty Products group"
249,"And so when we talk about that business, we are talking across all those different categories that are performing well"
250,"So I think we expect that business to continue to be strong, and even within that segment there's a bit of a balance that goes on at any given time"
251,We've seen some nice growth with CytoSport in some more traditional channels
252,"Remember, the C-store business, which is a big part of the CytoSport business, isn't measured"
253,And the team's done a great job not only gaining distribution but creating innovative new items to meet the needs of that channel
254,So it's all of those things that are really setting it up for a strong 2017.
255,"Heather, just a reminder, fresh pork exports are â€“ they are a decent-sized part of the International business"
256,"They're not, I would say, a huge part of the overall company"
257,"And on any given year, obviously, we've had strength"
258,and then we've had some challenges with pricing pressure with products coming out of the European markets the last several years
259,But it does look like the markets are setting up for a strong full year
260,"Certainly, you've got the China conditions, but I think we've also all read what's happened, or what is happening in South Korea, which is a strong export market for us"
261,So I mean we do feel like it'll continue to be strong throughout the year
262,"No, we're less than that, Heather"
263,Great
264,"Well, thank you all very much"
265,"While unfavorable market conditions in the turkey industry challenged our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, the balance we have intentionally built into all of our businesses allowed us to deliver earnings growth this quarter"
266,"Our team has a track record of delivering results, and we clearly understand what needs to be done this year to deliver the guidance range we provided"
267,"On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today"
