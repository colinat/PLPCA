0,"Good morning, everyone"
1,The first quarter was certainly a challenging one for Kellogg North America
2,We again delivered strong operating profit margin expansion
3,"However, our top-line was not where we wanted it to be"
4,John has already walked you through the unexpectedly soft consumption that was felt across our categories and across the entire industry
5,"And, as he said, it appears that at least some of this was due to transitory factors that will not persist"
6,We also had a notable decrease in trade inventories
7,We knew that trade inventory would come out in Q1 and it did
8,"During the quarter, we made good progress on productivity initiatives, investment in food and packaging and our DSD transition, which I'll come back to in a moment"
9,"And we had strong commercial plans across our businesses for Q2 and the second half, though I'm confident that our sales performance will improve"
10,"Let's briefly walk through each business, starting with the ones whose results came in largely as expected, and then moving to Morning Foods and Snacks, where the factors I mentioned were most acute"
11,I'll start with Specialty Channels on slide 13.
12,"Our Specialty Channels business in Q1 delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth, even against a tough year-ago comparison"
13,"The net sales growth was delivered through equal parts of volume and price/mix, and via market expansion in core channels, as well as expansion in emerging growth channels, all of which was aided by innovation"
14,"Operating profit margin continued to improve, driven by price, mix, as well as continued Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting savings"
15,So we continue to feel good about Specialty Channels
16,Now we'll look at our North America Other segment on slide number 14.
17,"As we expected, this segment posted strong 8% profit growth in Q1 with margins improving substantially, up 200 basis points on the strength of Project K and ZBB savings"
18,"In Frozen, Eggo consumption returned to growth in March"
19,"With the removal of artificial ingredients and solid commercial plans, we expect better net sales performance in coming quarters"
20,MorningStar Farms is a similar story
21,Consumption turned to growth in March and our renovated line is now on shelf and being supported
22,"So that should get gradually better, too"
23,"At Kashi, trade inventory corrected, following innovation launches in late Q4."
24,"However, we continue to show good progress in our overhauled Cereal business, which continued to grow consumption in the natural channel and grew consumption in xAOC measured channels, too, with particularly encouraging gains for our bear naked brand"
25,And we're just starting to get back on air with media
26,We launched our new Nut Butter Bars in January
27,Our early signs are good and we're following it up with further renovations and innovations in the second half
28,"So Kashi is another business in which we expect to see gradual improvement as the year goes on, both in consumption and in net sales"
29,"In Canada, we're still seeing the volume impact of our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover the steep transactional FX impact of a weakened Canadian dollar"
30,We expect the impact to stabilize as we lap our pricing actions in the next couple of months
31,So Canada is on track to meet expectations for the year
32,"Now, let's turn to slide 15 and U.S"
33,Morning Foods
34,"Morning Foods' Q1 sales were affected by the category-wide consumption slowdowns in January and February, by trade inventory reductions coming out of Q4 and by the timing of our commercial plans"
35,Performance across our core six brands was mixed
36,Our kid brands grew consumption and share behind a strong performance of Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops
37,"Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the leading category innovation this year, and Froot Loops responded very well to its new Whatever Froots Your Loops campaign"
38,"On the flipside, Special K and Mini-Wheats started the year in decline, largely due to the year-on-year timing of innovation and renovation"
39,"Last year, both had important activity in Q1."
40,"While this year, both are set to launch new and renovated offerings during Q2."
41,"We expect quarterly sequential improvement in sales for cereal and share, driven by continued momentum in our kid brands and by the renovation, innovation, and new communication for the Special K and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, which are breaking here in the month of May"
42,We also have a major in-store event coming in late Q2 behind the movie release of Despicable Me 3.
43,"Pop-Tarts in Q1 continued to gain share in toaster pastries, driven by the successful launch of new Pop-Tarts Dunkin'"
44,Donuts flavors
45,We'll continue to drive this brand hard in the back half of the year with the launch of JOLLY RANCHER-flavored Pop-Tarts
46,"So we expect gradual improvement in Morning Foods' sales performance in the coming quarters, while OP margin expansion will continue"
47,"Now, let's talk about U.S"
48,Snacks shown on slide number 16.
49,Snacks had a tough quarter for the consumption and trade inventory reasons we've mentioned previously
50,"Additionally, but not unexpectedly, we also experienced some initial order softness during the few weeks in February when we were informing our DSD employees of our exit"
51,These factors combined to pull down net sales and operating profit in the quarter
52,"The good news is that we continue to gain share in Crackers, led by our Big 3 brands"
53,And we saw newly-supported Keebler gain share in Cookies
54,"We also sustained share growth momentum in another focused brand for us, Rice Krispies Treats"
55,So our underlying in-market business performance remains healthy
56,And we feel good about what's coming in our commercial plans for the rest of the year
57,"We've already launched Special K Snacks in Q1 and still transitioning that on shelf, but that will help us stabilize that brand"
58,"As we transition out of DSD, we are ramping up brand-building support across key cracker brands, wholesome snack brands, and Pringles"
59,"Q2 will see support behind our innovations as well as in-store promotions around Major League Soccer and the tie-in to the movie, Despicable Me 3."
60,"And going into the second half, our plan strengthens further with innovations behind Cheez"
61,"-It, the renovation of Nutri-Grain and new single-serve pack-form adds across multiple categories, all of this supported by the incremental brand-building that is a key element of our transition to our new Go-to-Market Model"
62,"This brings me to another important development in the quarter, our progress against the DSD transition"
63,This is graphically depicted on slide number 16 (sic)
64,[17]
65,"Transition planning is well underway, driven by a multi-functional team and led by individuals that orchestrated our successful integration of Pringles"
66,Joint business planning with customers has gone well
67,And our retention of employees is on track
68,And we've made numerous other elements of progress against a host of operational elements
69,So we feel very good about our progress so far
70,Portfolio optimization began in Q1 and will continue through the transition as we optimize the assortment for warehouse delivery and work down inventories
71,"This will have an increasing impact on volume as the year goes on, but it facilitates the transitions this year and should contribute to a net improvement in velocity and profitability as we get into 2018."
72,"Customer transitions have begun, with the first of our customer base being converted here in Q2."
73,"This will trigger the first of the list price adjustments, which will have an increasing impact as more customers get converted across Q2 and Q3."
74,Keep in mind that we already have a fully-functioning warehouse system that is both efficient and scalable and is ready for this transition
75,"Remember, though, most of DSD network will have to remain open through the transition"
76,"The final exit, including the final head count and DC reductions, will happen as the last of the customers gets converted during Q4."
77,That's when you will see the true benefit of the savings begin to come forward at their ultimate run rate
78,"So in summary for Kellogg North America, our top-line performance across the region was affected by softened consumption across most categories in the U.S"
79,", as well as some shipment timing and some short-term issues that should be behind us"
80,"Commercial plans get stronger in Q2, and we are making good progress on the DSD transition"
81,And we continue to deliver strong improvement in our operating profit margin
82,"With that, I'll turn it back to John for a look at the international regions"
83,"Hey, Rob, Paul"
84,"Yeah, Kashi"
85,I will come to Kashi in a second
86,"If you look across Crackers, Cookies, Pop-Tarts, Cereal, Frozen, and Kashi, consumption was higher than our shipments in every case"
87,Okay?
88,So it really was a significant impact
89,"Again, more granular on something like Kashi, there's a big disconnect in cereal, in particular, partly because of the selling in of innovation at the end of last year, which we knew drove some inventory in"
90,"The good news is, is the consumption is exactly where, if not ahead of where we planned"
91,So we're seeing that come through in the first quarter and will normalize now as we go forward into the second quarter
92,I want to dig deeper and give you a little bit of color maybe on Snacks
93,"Snacks was off, as you can see, by about 6%"
94,"Half of that, we think, is consumption-related broad-based trends in the marketplace"
95,"As I said, we grew share in Crackers"
96,We grew share in the Keebler Cookie brand
97,Rice Krispies continues to do well
98,"But the other half is things like the inventory decline, so planned SKU culls and a little bit of disruption around the, as John said, the transition as it relates to ordering, particularly in those two weeks when we spoke to our sales force about the future"
99,"So you can see this disconnect come through just about in every one of our businesses, it gives us the belief it's transitory and things will get better"
100,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
101,LLC Thank you
102,Here's how we see the status of the DSD transition
103,"So far, everything is on track"
104,And we're very happy with where we stand
105,"If you step back, remember, what's driving this is a consumer and shopper-driven reason and a customer channel-driven reason"
106,"Part of the orientation away to a pull model is that we will shift significant resources to brand-building behind those, what I would call, invest-to-grow brands, particularly within Snacks, brands like Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, for example"
107,Our warehouse model is more effective and efficient
108,We already ship through warehouses
109,We deliver better service and higher in-stocks and it offers us better joint value creation with our customers as we come through on one platform
110,"As far as the shelf is concerned, we're deliberately leaning in to optimize our assortment, so we can make the shelf work harder"
111,"And so we are looking proactively to make sure that we have our fastest moving, biggest brands, where the investment is going to go, on shelf"
112,We're not looking to lose space
113,We're looking to optimize our shelf so it can work harder
114,"Within our customer discussions, so far, there is broad-based agreement that this is the future of delivery in these kinds of categories"
115,And we're working through how we achieve it in the near-term
116,So we've had generally very good support for the move
117,"Specifically on brand-building, as I alluded to, you will see the brand-building ramp up here as we go through Q2, Q3, and Q4."
118,"It is really important as we go through this transition that we have strong plans in market to ensure shelf presence, display presence"
119,and we've got big things to sell behind
120,"So as you look at our Snacks business year to go, we do have a double-digit increase in brand-building coming on crackers, wholesome snacks and Pringles"
121,We have renovation of the core Nutri-Grain business and brand
122,We have a big range of seasonal innovations across cookies and wholesome that will drive fun and excitement and display in store
123,We have Cheez-
124,It innovation coming in the back half
125,"And we have lots of new pack formats across crackers, cookies, and wholesome snacks to drive incremental consumption in new occasions"
126,And a lot of those packs will exist in the mainstream retail environment as well
127,So we have a pretty packed program of things to come that will drive excitement in the category
128,and we'll benefit from the brand-building as we put it in in the back half of the year
129,"I can't give you a quantification today, David"
130,But what you're saying is what we're doing
131,We are eliminating tail where it doesn't make sense
132,And we're looking to prioritize and maximize assortment against the biggest things we have
133,"And so when I talk about putting more brand-building in behind brands like Cheez-Its and Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera, we are making sure that we have the most efficient and effective assortment to drive our business harder going forward"
134,"But there is a degree of SKU rationalization, and we've leant in proactively on that"
135,"Hey, Josh, I can't go into detail on price or anything that you call the give-backs"
136,But I can tell you that the discussions with retailers have gone well
137,"And within the context of the plans we put together going in, so far so good"
138,"Yes, Josh, I think it would be fair to say there is always pressure from our retail partners to keep prices low"
139,"If you look at the data we see, you see there's not a lot of massive deflation going on in our categories right now"
140,We have seen a little bit of push from private labels in selected categories
141,Frozen would be one
142,"We've see private label items come up, and we've also seen our Eggo items come up, which suggests that there are factors going on there"
143,"And the retail environment is changing to adapt to consumer needs, quite frankly"
144,"And so we're seeing growth on the fringes of retail in all kinds of places, just incumbent on us to be more agile with the right food in the right format at the right price, depending on those retail environments"
145,But the pressure is the same as it's always been
146,"Yes, we see the improvement coming sequentially across the year"
147,"A far as the Snacks business is concerned, obviously, I'm not sure we'll see incremental volume or price pressure, as John alluded to"
148,"As part of the transition, our retailers will actually get more margin here"
149,And we have great plans to pull coming through in brand-building
150,"So we will see some deflation of pricing because of the net sales impact, but overall underlying velocities, there's going to be a lot of volatility"
151,But we're still going to execute our plan
152,"I think some of that 50% or so, half of it being consumption decline, was related to the January, February impacts that I think the entire industry felt"
153,We're not anticipating those declines to become the norm
154,I think they were transitory in nature
155,And so we feel very confident that snacking categories are ripe for growth going forward
156,"Specifically to Kashi Snacks, we launched two Nut Butter Bars at the beginning of the year here, and so far so good"
157,The pickup has been better than we expected
158,We have more listings to come in the back half around nut butters
159,"We're also fully renovating our chewy bars here at the end of the second quarter, moving into the third quarter, and the food is significantly preferred, so we have a real upgrade coming on our chewy bars"
160,So that's the innovation and renovation
161,"We've just gone back on air with new advertising which features the bars here in March, April, so"
162,And that will continue through Q2 and Q3.
163,So we are on track to deliver what we expected this year
164,"Now as we've said, on Kashi bars in particular, we expected growth on cereal this year from a consumption point of view"
165,That is our outlook
166,"On bars, we expected to dramatically decline the rate of decline, if you like"
167,"So we're not expecting growth, but we are expecting a much lower rate of decline, in the single digits"
168,"And so far, we're on track"
169,and we feel good with the uptake of these new bars
170,"In terms of points of distribution on bars, we are seeing going into the second half of the year, a stabilization as it pertains to points of distribution, which is positive because we hadn't seen that over the past couple of years"
171,"So with a bit of luck and a bit of hope and a bit of good execution, we're bottoming out here"
172,and we can start to look forward on snacks
173,"Specifically to Kashi, Michael, or to the"
174,"Granted, we expect it to come across all of our businesses, as I mentioned, that we see consumption disconnected from shipments in just about every category"
175,So we expect improving consumption on cereal through the back half of the year
176,"We expect it on cookies and crackers from a velocity point of view, Pop-Tarts"
177,"Frozen, we're anticipating getting back into growth"
178,"Kashi Cereal, we're looking to see that consumption growth come through in our business"
179,"Specialty, we expect to maintain the momentum we've developed"
180,"And in our Canadian business, we're going to lap, as I said, the pricing interventions from a year ago soon, and we expect an improving performance there as well"
181,So it really is broad-based
182,"We don't give quarterly indications, but we have factored in, obviously, a degree of an inventory build and a transfer here through the second and third quarter, which will be offset by some other factors as the year goes on"
183,"So as John, I think, might pick it up, we'd originally factored in the impact to the company in the year from this"
184,"It's Paul, David"
185,The Special K Cereal business has actually flattened out pretty much and held or grown share in the last two years
186,"The impact in Q1 was really down to a timing of innovation activity, and we have all of that lined up to start"
187,"and it's starting here in May, as we speak"
188,"So the Cereal business, you picked it up"
189,"If we're going to win and drive this category forward, our Core 6 needs to fire on all cylinders"
190,And K needs to do better in the back half
191,We think we have the plans to do that
192,"Our kid brands momentum will continue, specifically with wholesome snacks"
193,There's more than Special K to wholesome snacks
194,"Rice Krispies Treats continues to grow, and we look to accelerate that"
195,Nutri-Grain has significant renovation coming as well
196,"And then the Special K transition is underway, with better food and we'll benefit from the new campaign across the entire brand"
197,So we expect an improving trend in Special K bars as part of our wholesome snack business year to go
