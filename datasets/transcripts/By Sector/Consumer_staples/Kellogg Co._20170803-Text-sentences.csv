0,"Thanks, Fareed, and good morning everyone"
1,"As the chart on slide 10 shows, Kellogg North America saw sequential improvement in our performance for net sales, operating profit and for operating profit margin"
2,"A few things to point out, each of which I'll describe in more detail in a moment"
3,"First, we're seeing growth or improving sales performance in businesses ranging from Specialty Channels to Frozen Foods, to the Kashi Company to Canada"
4,"Second, an area of disappointment in the quarter was Morning Foods top-line performance"
5,"Like so many categories for cereal and toaster pastry categories, we haven't returned to last year's rates"
6,"It's incumbent on us to drive these categories, and we have stronger plans coming in the second half"
7,"Third, we feel very good about our transition into warehouse and out of DSD, which is nearly complete"
8,We are right on track on this big step towards the transformation of U.S
9,Snacks
10,"And finally, we continue to realize good margin expansion"
11,It's driven by productivity and it has us on track for our 2018 targets
12,But I want to emphasize something
13,We are mindful of ensuring that these productivity efforts don't in any way inhibit our return to growth
14,"So, now let's briefly walk through each of our North America segments"
15,We'll start with U.S
16,Snacks and our update on our DSD transition on slide 11.
17,"As I mentioned, this transition has gone very well"
18,We are now entering the final wind-down phase
19,It's important to recognize what is now behind us
20,We've completed all customer negotiations
21,"This means we know the list price adjustment to customers, and we have been developing joint business plans with them"
22,We finalized our SKU rationalizations
23,So we know the shelf assortment
24,"We've started reducing complexity in our supply chain, and we started to make the store shelf work harder for us and for our customers"
25,"As of this week, we are 100% out of DSD"
26,"That is, we are receiving orders from customers and we are shipping to all customers warehouses"
27,"It's early days, but where we have customer data, we are already seeing improved on-shelf availability"
28,"We've now entered the final phase of the project, completing the exit"
29,"Not only are we now closing the distribution centers, but we are also in hyper-care mode, in which we devote resources to stores in order to ensure that everything, from ordering to shelf tagging, to shipments, are operating smoothly"
30,This is important because it's also the time when we are pivoting our teams' focus to driving top-line growth
31,"We are ramping up our brand-building and in-store activation, and we're planning and executing jointly with our customers, all to ensure we start growing demand"
32,"We are obviously pleased with how this is going on all fronts, from the strong engagement and collaboration of our customers, to the attention to detail of our project team, to the positive attitude of our sales force and supply chain"
33,And we really want to thank all of them for their dedication and focus on execution during this challenging transition
34,"Obviously, we're taking on a very complex change initiative, one that could present executional risk and/or competitive risk at any time, but the team is managing it very well, and our full-year outlook for this transition has not changed"
35,"Now, let's talk about Snacks results for the quarter, which is shown on slide number 12."
36,"Net sales were flat in the quarter, reflecting two factors related to the DSD transition"
37,"Firstly, there was the positive impact of inventory pipeline fill"
38,This is the shipping of inventory into our customers' warehouses as we convert them from DSD to warehouse distribution
39,This began in the latter half of Q2 and ramped up in early Q3 as we converted the remaining customers
40,"Secondly, in-store promotion activity was reduced, as you can see in the scanner data, not only in the sharp declines in volume sold on promotion, but also in our sizable increases in average prices"
41,"As you would expect, this pullback was driven by a combination of us and our customers wanting to mitigate big shipment swings as we produce and ship inventory for their warehouses"
42,"With us now fully in warehouse distribution, we strengthen our promotional calendar in the second half"
43,This reduced promo activity is masking some good underlying trends
44,"Our Big 3 cracker brands held share, despite the reduced activity"
45,"Keebler Fudge Shoppe maintained consumption and share growth in cookies, and Rice Krispies Treats sustained its momentum in wholesome snacks"
46,"Importantly, we started up our accelerated investment in brand-building during the quarter as we transition to a pull model"
47,"This, along with some duplicative costs as we resourced up our warehouse distribution, held down profit in the quarter"
48,"But this profit came in as we'd expected, and the increased brand-building bodes well for consumption performance in the second half"
49,So Snacks is in a good place
50,"The DSD transition is right where we'd expected it to be, and we are now turning to a pull model that will help transform this business"
51,"It's worth reminding everyone that this transition starts with a reduction in net sales, due to the price we set to customers, a reduction in SKUs and somewhat lower secondary and tertiary displays, so net sales come down for 12 months before they start growing again"
52,"On the flipside, our operating profit and operating margins start to move higher right away and especially in Q4, when we completely eliminate our DSD expenses"
53,That's even despite the sizable reinvestments we're making
54,"All of this is already in our guidance, and I think you'll agree that we'll come out of this with a faster growing, more profitable U.S"
55,Snacks business
56,"Now, let's turn to slide 13 on U.S"
57,Morning Foods
58,"Whilst we're pleased with our great progress on margin expansion, we are not happy about our top-line performance in this segment"
59,"Our Core 6 cereal brands collectively held share in the quarter, but the cereal category remained softer than expected"
60,"Whilst there are a variety of industry-wide trends that we can point to, it's our job to drive this category through great commercial ideas, across major brands"
61,"To that then, we expect to see sequential improvement in the second half, and here's why"
62,"One, we will continue to support our taste-oriented brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, which continue to gain share behind effective media and innovation, respectively"
63,"In fact, Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the number one innovation this year across the entire category"
64,"Two, Special K was down year-on-year, but it improved sequentially and even returned to share growth in June, behind innovation and our new Own"
65,It campaign
66,This is a promising sign going into the second half
67,"And three, we have better in-store program in the second half"
68,This includes stronger seasonal innovation and strong Back-to-School programs
69,"Looking beyond 2017, we've got to think bigger"
70,"Once we're happy with the performance of our taste brands, we know we have to do more to reassert this category's health and wellness credentials"
71,It's the adult health-oriented segment that is pulling down the category
72,"And the way to reinvigorate that segment has always been through nutritional innovation claims and brand-building, so"
73,that's where we're focusing our efforts
74,An example of this is on the slide
75,"Late this year, we'll be launching a new Special K Nourish offering, featuring probiotics"
76,We'll have more to share with you as we get closer to 2018.
77,"Now let's talk about Specialty Channels, shown on slide number 14."
78,Our Specialty Channels business in Q2 delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth
79,"We generated growth in our three core channels, in which we already have leading positions, foodservice, convenience stores and vending"
80,"In foodservice, our growth was again led by the K-12 segment"
81,"And in C-stores and vending, our growth was aided by innovation"
82,"Importantly, in Q2, we implemented a transformation of our sales force to a hybrid direct and broker mode"
83,"This is expected to drive stronger focus on our core accounts, whilst expanding our market coverage by almost 40% across foodservice and convenience channels"
84,"Operating profit margin continued to improve strongly, driven by better price/mix and by continued savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting"
85,So we continue to feel good about our Specialty Channels business
86,"And growth should continue in the second half, even despite tough comparisons"
87,"Finally, we'll turn to slide number 15 and our North America Other segment"
88,"As we said would happen, we are solidly in profit growth for this segment"
89,Q2 was a third straight quarter of strong operating profit performance
90,But just as important is the fact that we also realized good sequential improvement in net sales
91,"At the Kashi Company, sales remained pressured by last year's exiting of non-core or less profitable SKUs, promotions and categories"
92,"But we're going to be lapping those soon, and the quarter offered promising signs of what's to come"
93,We realized another quarter of share gains in cereal and xAOC channels as well as in the natural channel
94,"And we saw markedly improved trends in these channels through our Wholesome Snacks business, as recent innovations and media are starting to take hold"
95,"We are turning the corner on this business, and we are confident we'll continue to see sequential improvement in top-line in the second half"
96,"In Canada, we also continue to see improving results"
97,Recall that we have been feeling the elasticity impact from our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover FX-driven input cost inflation
98,"We started to lap some of that, and our net sales and consumption have continued to improve"
99,"During Q2, our consumption declines in cereal moderated significantly"
100,"Our base consumption was again very strong, and we increased share as a result"
101,"In Wholesome Snacks, we gained share, too, also behind strong base consumption"
102,And our Pringles business grew consumption and share as well
103,So Canada is on the right track to meet expectations for the year
104,"In Frozen, Eggo grew consumption and share, aided by the removal of artificial ingredients and the launch of kid-loved shapes, with Mickey Mouse-shaped waffles leading the way"
105,"Our frozen veggie business under MorningStar Farms and the Gardenburger brands added another quarter to its return to consumption growth, thanks to a focus on core burger offerings"
106,So Frozen is back in growth and picking up momentum
107,"So to wrap up North America, Snacks came in as expected, with terrific progress on the DSD transition"
108,Specialty Channels continues to grow
109,And North America Other is turning the corner
110,"Morning Foods remains soft, so we have to redouble our efforts to get the cereal category growing again, but the net of all of this is sequential improvement on top of sustained margin expansion"
111,"With that, I'll turn you back to John for a look at our international regions"
112,"Hey, Matthew, I'd just tell you it's gone and is going very well"
113,We had great customer engagement
114,We have a great assortment
115,"And we were proactive, as you probably are aware, in managing that assortment, from an SKU reduction point of view, but also with a focus on making our biggest brands and our bigger SKUs work harder within that assortment"
116,"So as SKUs come out, we gain space on our faster, harder-working SKUs"
117,The pricing negotiations are all behind us
118,"For competitive reasons and obviously other reasons, I'm not going to go into those, but those will flow through our P&L as we go forward"
119,And there's been strong collaboration between our teams internally and our customer teams internally right all the way through this
120,We're out of DSD
121,We're 100% shipping through warehouses
122,"Our focus has pivoted to really the in-store environment right now, making sure that the ordering processes are working, the shelf hands are where they need to be, helping educate store-level employees on doing the job that we used to do"
123,And through the data we're seeing come through in the customers we can see already
124,", we're seeing in-stock's up, which is positive"
125,The internal center of gravity is now very much in Deanie's team around contributing to growth
126,So we're executing against our pull model
127,Brand-building will be up significantly in the back half
128,Our promotional pressure comes back now in the back half following the pullback in Q2 to manage the transition
129,"So you can expect good Back-to-School programs, fall football programs, holiday programs and the strengthening of our relation pipeline coming into 2018."
130,Our team's done a great job and the financials are exactly where we thought they would be and on track for the year to come
131,I'll take that
132,and maybe Fareed might want talk about how it lays down for the year
133,"But again, everything's on track and really where we thought it would be,"
134,"so there's, I wouldn't say, we're necessarily ahead"
135,There has been some impact obviously in the business through Q2 and we would expect to see some of that through the rest of the year
136,"The impacts, so far year-to-date, are really two"
137,"We saw some inventory come in, in Q2."
138,"And that was probably about 5% that contributed to our performance in Q2, offset by emerging merchandising pullback and some of the price adjustments coming through"
139,So those two things mostly offset each other
140,"As we pivot to the back half of the year, you will see a little more inventory come in in Q3."
141,"And also Q3 has July in it, so there's been a little bit more disruption, a merchandising pullback as we go through the execution"
142,"Then, as we said and I said in the prepared notes, we will see a drop off in net sales because of the price decline and the transfer of work as we go forward, and that would impact the P&L as we go forward"
143,"Down the P&L, we will see the costs of the DSD organization collapse as we go through that and really fluctuate with full force for Q4 this year"
144,"Does that answer your question, Chris?"
145,"Ken, let me take it up a level"
146,"If you look at the category, the history of that category, there have been cycles over the years that have driven the category"
147,"Those cycles are often related to health and wellness, positively"
148,"and, many times, negatively"
149,The whole fiber oat brand booms of prior years drove the category
150,"Well frankly, through the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, low-calorie, low-fat and weight management really drove the category"
151,And no brands rode the category harder in those years than Special K
152,"As we get through to 2010 and into the recent years, low-calorie, low-fat has come off trend and we have obviously been impacted significantly by that"
153,"What encourages me as I look forward and where science and nutrition is going, where the trends are, clearly what is big and right in front of us now"
154,"and I think will be really important is gut health and the gut-brain connection, the importance of the microbiome and the importance of fiber coming back into people's diets, either prebiotic or probiotic benefits"
155,"Those things, considering nine out of 10 Americans don't get enough fiber today, I think are going to position our category extremely well to grow as we go forward"
156,"So the tailwind is coming back, in my opinion, following a short period here of headwind"
157,"For us, we need to reassert our credentials in these areas"
158,"So we'll do the hygiene work we're already doing, removing artificials, et cetera, but the big wins will come from upping our claims on existing brands like Raisin Bran, Mini-Wheats, around fiber and the importance of fiber and then, driving innovation into our adult brands, things like Special K with probiotics, et cetera, as we go forward"
159,"So that's how the health and wellness piece, for me, is encouraging and gives me belief that we can get this category back with a tailwind behind it"
160,"The other thing that's important, quite frankly, is how people eat today"
161,"And as you probably heard us talk before, 35-plus percent of cereal there is consumed outside of breakfast occasion"
162,"And in repositioning the category, it's a big word, to be"
163,"more of an all-day food and an all-day snack to be consumed whenever you want, is, I think, critical to how we open up growth potential for the category, whether that's driving brands or Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes or Rice Krispies throughout the day through a recipe or consumption opportunity or whether it's bringing innovation in the area of convenience and affordability to the cereal category to unlock those opportunities throughout the day"
164,"And then last, and also important is, we got to keep the pressure on fun and taste in this category, which has always been an important part of what drives the heartbeat of the performance of the category"
165,"If I look today, the pressure on fun and taste is fine"
166,"The other two, we can do more"
167,"So big question; the reason we originally did this was a consumer shelf-driven strategic decision, given how, when you look at the food business and the retail business, how the shopper's shopping is changing so much"
168,"So the focus was to shift our resources away from what we consider for our business, at least, to be a demoted route to market and get our resources against the shopper, the brand-building resources we need in this changing environment that the shopper shops in"
169,"Talking top-to-top with our largest customers, they all see the benefits of moving in that direction because most of our customers are moving into a click-and-collect world"
170,Our click-and-collect for our overall e-commerce business is actually doing extremely well
171,"It's growing in the second quarter, up 70%-plus"
172,So we're doing very well and that's total e-comm
173,"So we need to feed that trend as we go forward by moving more of our resources, marketing dollars, people dollars, against where that world is going to be, not just e-commerce, but also the smaller format environments that are growing as well"
174,We have a great warehouse system
175,Our customers have great warehouse systems
176,"75% of what we make as a company in North America already goes through a warehouse system, and we know we get better service and higher in-stocks in a warehouse system"
177,"So when we go to one delivered system to all of our retail partners, not just certain ones versus other ones, I can have a better deal-value-creation conversation about one platform delivered, shared efficiencies, scale benefits from the Kellogg Company that could help both us and them in what, let's face it, is a changing retail environment where they need to pivot some of their cost of investment against changing their model just to meet where the shopper shops"
178,So I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for
179,It was about a big strategic move to get ahead of the shopper
180,is why we did it
181,"Every customer's different, to be honest"
182,"And that's not trying to skirt around the question, but some of the earlier customers, we proactively culled SKUs with the aim of strengthening our assortment to get a harder-working assortment behind our biggest brands"
183,"With some customers, we're gaining space on the shelf"
184,"Some customers, we're giving up space because of items we're deleting simplify everything, quite frankly, through the process"
185,"And then, we're regaining space behind those deletions around our biggest brands like Cheez-It or Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera"
186,So it is a customer-by-customer picture
187,"The aim of this, though, David, is to get a harder working portfolio"
188,"And remember, in a DSD world relative to a warehouse world, the customer margin in the warehouse world is higher than in a DSD world"
189,"So you have big mega brands with big brand-building investment, promotional pressure, there's a real incentive for the win-win here to drive these brands harder going forward"
190,July will be the same because we're still transitioning through July
191,"So July, we don't expect any difference"
192,Our ramping up of programming really comes in in August
193,That will be offset by obviously inside the P&L
194,"So, Nielsen data, you'll see some improvement"
195,In the P&L you'll see the impact of the net sales
196,"As for the commitment we made in the past to put margins up to the norm, that commitment still stands"
197,"Hey, Jonathan"
198,"Internally, we talk, focused very much on what we call the Core 6."
199,"There are six brands, which are our Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Rice Krispies, Special K, Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran, plus one or two, which is Kashi, on account of the Kashi Company"
200,Those brands cover the broad spectrum of needs in the cereal category
201,And so for the fundamentals of the category to work well
202,", you have to have, we say, you've got to be firing on all cylinders across those six brands"
203,That is innovation
204,That is renovation
205,That is great ideas
206,And that is excellence when it comes to in-store execution and leveraging the scale of those brands across our retail base
207,And so that's very much what we focus on
208,So what you said is where we're going or what we're doing
209,"As I mentioned, there are areas we can do better"
210,We need to focus more on those health and wellness credentials across our adult brands
211,"We also need to adapt more to the changing shopper environment as we go forward and make sure that our foods, our brands are available in those areas where the shoppers are shopping down the road"
212,So what you said is what we're doing
213,We segment this category through something we call demand chain
214,It looks at consumer and it looks at shopper
215,And it looks at cohorts within all different age groups
216,"So we target, whether it's millennials, boomers, families, we constantly look at how the shopper shops as part of how we motivate and drive these brands"
217,We can do more against boomers
218,And we can do more against millennials and Hispanics in our portfolio
219,We over-index against Hispanics and do very well there
220,"Millennials, we need to drive relevancy"
221,"This is why versatility comes into play and this is why those health and wellness credentials are really important in today's environment, but also important in the environments in which they shop and how they shop"
