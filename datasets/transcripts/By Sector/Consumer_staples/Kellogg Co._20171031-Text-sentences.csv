0,"Thanks, Fareed"
1,We'll start with our transformation of U.S
2,Snacks and an update on our DSD transition on slide number 16.
3,I'm very pleased with the execution of this extremely complex undertaking
4,"Customer feedback has been very good, and our operational metrics are all on track"
5,"By the end of July, we were shipping completely via warehouse distribution to all customers and exiting our DCs, trucks and equipment and reducing the workforce"
6,We are working diligently with our customer to ensure all details and issues are taken care of
7,And I'm extremely proud of how our organization has risen to this challenge
8,"From the standpoint of in-market performance, you saw the impact of the transition in our scanner data and we expected this"
9,We pulled right back on promotional activity in order to facilitate the production and shipping of initial inventories to the warehouses of our customers
10,"This resulted in sharp declines in incremental sales, promotional volume and number of displays"
11,"Our average number of items are down, too, reflecting our SKU rationalization"
12,"Now, as we look forward, we will see momentum build behind a more focused assortment on-shelf and fewer, but bigger, displays with an emphasis on quality positions"
13,"All of this will be supported by significant increases in brand-building against our largest brands, as we move from push to pull"
14,The net results of all of this will be an improvement in our in-market performance over the coming weeks and months
15,"From a financial perspective, the transformation of Snacks remains on track"
16,We have already begun to boost our brand-building investment
17,"And, as you can see in our Q3 P&L, the expected overhead reductions are coming through to the bottom line"
18,An undertaking of this magnitude isn't easy
19,We've come a long way and we still have work to do
20,But you're starting to see U.S
21,Snack's future taking shape
22,"There is no question that this will become a stronger, more profitable business"
23,"Snack's Q3 results, summarized on slide number 17, came in as expected"
24,Net sales were impacted by the factors we've already discussed: the list price adjustment; the pullback in merchandising; and the rationalization of SKUs
25,"Nevertheless, we also saw a strong increase in operating profit and operating margin"
26,"We did boost our brand-building investment in Q3, which bodes well for future performance"
27,"And this was more than offset by a ramp-up of overhead savings during the quarter, as we reduced our workforce and exited distribution centers, trucks and equipment"
28,"In the fourth quarter, we're working to build momentum"
29,"We're increasing brand-building significantly, including in-market promotional support"
30,And we expect to see an improvement in consumption
31,"Meanwhile, we'll be close to a full overhead savings rate, boosting profit"
32,"We'll give back some benefits from Q3, including hurricane-related shipments and some brand-building timing, but profit growth will still be very strong"
33,"Now, let's turn to slide number 18 and U.S"
34,"Morning Foods, where our top-line and in-market performance have been below our expectations"
35,There are some things that have continued to work well
36,"We've continued to gain share in kid-oriented brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops, which have brought to market innovation and brand-building that have excited consumers"
37,And we've continued to improve our profit margins through effective productivity initiatives
38,Where we've fallen short is on bringing enough excitement to our adult-oriented health and wellness brands
39,This is the segment that is most holding down the entire cereal category's sales and especially ours
40,What we have to do is get back to running the playbook that worked well for us before this year and that is working well for our kid-oriented brands to-date
41,So here's what we're planning for 2018.
42,"Firstly, we do have stronger commercial ideas"
43,"We have new media that will emphasize the health and wellness credentials of Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran, two brands that simply didn't have strong enough brand-building this year"
44,We also launched the next phase of the Special K Own
45,"It campaign, emphasizing the brand's inner strength credentials and positioning"
46,"And we've got great ideas for our kid-oriented brands, emphasizing out of breakfast snacking, for example"
47,"Secondly, you will see a step change in innovation next year"
48,"We'll renovate and innovate against our core, with news on Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops as well as more fruit-filled Raisin Bran and Special K that moves into probiotics"
49,This is bigger innovation activity than this year
50,We'll also try some new things that are new to the category
51,These will lean into health and wellness and into convenience
52,And you will hear more about them in the months to come
53,"Third, we'll drive bigger in-store excitement, with stronger properties and events and programs that leverage a total Kellogg go-to-market model now that U.S"
54,Snacks is no longer in DSD
55,"Imagine, for example, promotions and displays featuring Rice Krispies and Rice Krispies Treats together"
56,We can now do that seamlessly for the first time
57,We'll do these three things for Pop-Tarts as well
58,This brand will come to market with strong food news in January
59,And we'll follow that up with differentiated innovation around mid-year
60,We know what needs to be done because we've done it before
61,"Remember, we stabilized U.S"
62,"cereal in 2015 and 2016, and we've done it this year in our other three core cereal markets, all following the same playbook"
63,"For the rest of 2017, I don't see a change in trend for Morning Foods"
64,But I am encouraged by the strength of our plans and expect much improved performance in 2018.
65,"Now, let's talk about Specialty Channels shown on slide number 19."
66,"This business posted its ninth straight quarter of sales and profit growth in Q3, a reflection of continued good execution by our team"
67,"Sales growth in the quarter was led by both convenience and foodservice channels, Specialty segments like K through 12 schools and cafeterias, with an added pickup from hurricane-related orders"
68,"The hybrid direct and broker approach we implemented early this year is giving us greater focus on key accounts and channels, while more economically expanding our reach to new customers"
69,And it gives us confidence in the future growth potential for this business
70,Margin expansion continued on the strength of ZBB and RGM efforts
71,These are important and growing channels for us
72,And our sustained momentum reflects our continued commitment and focus to winning wherever the shopper shops
73,Turning to slide number 20 and our North American Other segment
74,We had signaled an improved second half
75,"And this segment certainly delivered, with a return to top line growth in Q3."
76,U.S
77,Frozen Foods sustained the momentum it started the previous quarter
78,Eggo accelerated its consumption growth and share gains on the strength of its removal of artificial colors and flavors and the success of Disney-shaped waffles
79,It also benefited from the exit of a competitor
80,"This was skewed mostly to the east coast, and the brand grew even excluding this"
81,"Our Morningstar Farms line has returned to consumption and share growth, too, reflecting focused marketing and in-store support on our core burger offerings during the summer grilling season"
82,"Kashi Company continued its sequential improvement in the quarter, as anticipated"
83,"Whilst we haven't completely lapped some of the distribution declines on the Kashi brand, we are seeing strong momentum in cereal share led by Bare Naked, which is now the number one granola brand in the U.S"
84,"Meanwhile, our renovated snacks offerings are stabilizing share, as we had anticipated, with share getting back up to flat in the quarter"
85,"In Canada, we generated continued improvement in consumption, with broad-based share gains in both cereal and snacks"
86,This business has now lapped the elasticity impact of price increases executed last year and is showing consistent improvement as we invest behind strong commercial programming and innovation
87,"So to wrap up North America, I'm encouraged by the way we're executing post-DSD in Snacks"
88,I'm delighted to see our North American Other businesses turning around
89,And we're sustaining good momentum in Specialty Channels
90,"Cereal is a tough category right now, but we have a stronger commercial plan in place, particularly as we get to 2018."
91,"And, of course, I like what we've done to our cost structure, which has driven continued margin expansion"
92,I'll now hand you back to John for a review of international business
93,"Hey, Ken"
94,"Obviously, I'm not going to talk about competitors"
95,We're pretty much focused on doing our job
96,and that's rebuilding momentum
97,And I feel good about our plan and the strength of our plan in Q4.
98,"We're reinvesting in, obviously, significant amounts of brand-building here behind a pull model"
99,"We're reinvesting in in-store promotions behind a more focused assortment and we are driving more impactful, larger displays in key positions in stores"
100,"When you exit DSD, you're always going to lose some tertiary and secondary displays, but the benefits of shipping through warehouse is that we can drive some big impact displays across our biggest brands as we build momentum into what will be a strong Q1 as well from an innovation point of view and our ability to leverage the Power of K in-store going forward across one delivered platform"
101,So we're focused on getting the momentum back in our brands
102,And our plans look very strong year-to-go
103,"As it regards Morning Foods and cereal, specifically, we're not seeing points of distribution or things happen at a category level, per se"
104,"We are, obviously, disappointed with our performance this year"
105,And we're not hitting our plan
106,We're hitting our plan on many elements around kids and productivity where we're not hitting our plan has been around our biggest adult brands
107,"And that shortfall on brands like Mini-Wheats and Special K and, to a certain degree, Raisin Bran, is what's driving a softer category performance this year"
108,The category's going be down between 2% and 3%
109,"And some of that, quite frankly, is on us"
110,"We need to now pivot and reassert our health and wellness credentials on those adult brands, increasing claims, news and innovation around those brands as we go into next year"
111,So I've mentioned probiotics on Special K
112,We have news coming on Raisin Bran
113,And one thing we'll talk to you about in coming months
114,is some more transformational innovation coming to the category around the area of digestive health and convenience as we look to really stimulate adult growth within the cereal category
115,"As you go back over time, this category has always responded, over the past 50 years, to health and wellness, whether it was fortification, fiber, oat bran, low calorie, low fat in the 1990s and 2000s"
116,We need to drive the health credentials of the category
117,"And that's what our plan is as we go into next year, whilst continue to drive fun and taste and versatility, and, as John said, big consumer excitement engagement through big properties and fun in-store"
118,So that's really where we're headed
119,And I'm very much focused forward right now on those things
120,"Hey, David"
121,It's Paul
122,"It's hard for me to give you a sense of the exact volume declines, but remember what we said coming into this"
123,"There is a 50% to 20% SKU rationalization that will obviously not have that amount of impact on our business, but will have a limited impact"
124,We hope to gain space on some of our core items to get a more powerful assortment there
125,"At the same time, we said and we knew we would get fewer displays as we came out of DSD but more impactful displays"
126,And we pulled right back on promotions and display support through a period of three to four months here to be able to operate effectively in what is a new model for the Snacks team
127,We have now pivoted
128,Brand-building was up in Q3 and will be up much more in Q4.
129,"Our investment in promotions and in-store support with our customers is now beginning to come to life as we reinvest behind these biggest brands, and that will continue as we go into next year"
130,I'm optimistic we will see consumption improvement in the coming weeks and months on this business
131,"We have a strong innovation pipeline coming at the beginning of the year, so that will accelerate into next year from a consumption point of view"
132,"So we're now, if you like, the transition is behind us in many ways"
133,"We're now very much focused on operating effectively in a warehouse-delivered model, which we think we can do because we do it across our other businesses"
134,"It's a good question, David"
135,Our business is responding in the way we expected it to
136,So all of our key metrics are right where the team expected them to be
137,"It takes a lot of work in-store to make sure tags and placement and compliance is there across 20,000-plus stores, which we used to call on twice a week"
138,"But so far so good, and we'll continue to improve as we go forward"
139,So there's nothing outside of our assumptions in our business case at the moment that would worry us
140,"Like I say, we're just focused on getting back to growth with our customers and then obviously working with our customers in a new delivered environment, where we can also help them from a cost to serve point of view as we're on one platform now and build those joint value-creating plans in ways that we couldn't before, which I think will be really important looking forward"
141,"Absolutely, Brian"
142,"When we laid out the business plan when we started this at the beginning of the year, this was really based on a set of consumer-based and shopper-based assumptions, which is exactly what you said"
143,"Investing money in a go-to market mechanism or operating model, the consumers don't see the benefit from, quite frankly, was not where we wanted to be"
144,So those resources are now going into focusing on how and where the shopper shops
145,"Whether that's brand-building in old-fashioned ways or new-fashioned ways from a shopper point of view, reaching those shoppers in whichever retail environment they choose to shop, that's exactly what we're doing"
146,"We're also investing more resources, people resources, against where the growth channels are in our business"
147,"So we're seeing, for example, eCommerce in North America in Q3 grew over 60%"
148,"So like every company, winning where the shopper shops in new environments, be"
149,that pure play or click-and-collect is right up there on our agenda
150,"And investing in capabilities, whether it be supply chain, marketing, sales in that environment, is where some of these dollars are going"
151,"Also remember some of the highest growth potential brands in our portfolio, Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, these brands are going get significantly more brand-building, way up there in the double digits for the next year, as we look to accelerate those brands"
152,"Whether that's TV, media type investments, whether it's customer focused investments, whether it's capital into pack/price format investments to make sure that we have exactly the right offering in the right channel to fit the consumers and the shoppers' needs"
153,"What we said we're doing, we're going to do, and you'll see it come through in the months to come into next year"
154,"Thanks, John"
155,"As I look forward on our portfolio, as I emphasized, it's less about absolute money or share of voice as it used to be"
156,It's more about getting the right ideas behind the right brands
157,"We have a great set of existing core brands, the Core 6, as we call them"
158,"They cover 70% of the needs when it comes to the category, number one"
159,"We have to up our game on brands like Mini-Wheats, Special K, and Raisin Bran to bring, as Steve said, contemporary health and wellness credentials to those brands"
160,We're down the track on Special K
161,"And we're seeing the brand begin to respond, not only in the U.S"
162,but around the world
163,"And we're bringing more, in the way of probiotics to Special K next year"
164,Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats
165,", we can do a lot more to pull out the wellness credentials of those brands and talk to consumers about them"
166,"This isn't category work, per se"
167,"This is brand work relevant to consumer needs, brand-on-brand"
168,"I've spoken before about how the category's always been driven over time, actually through nutrition"
169,"Whether it was fortification back in the 1950s, fiber, oat bran in the 1970s and 1980s, and then for a long while here, low calorie, low fat drove the Special K brand in particular and the category for years"
170,"Now, I believe gut health and science is coming back to nutrition and nutrition in the cereal category"
171,We're well placed as a category to actually find tailwinds in nutrition in the months and years to come
172,It's good for cereal
173,and it's good for our emphasis on health and wellness
174,"You add the Kashi brands and the Kashi business to that as well and we have a on-trend set of brands, I think, for the 10 years to come"
175,"The critical thing, though, is finding great commercial ideas, renovation and innovation that can bring to life those trends in unique ways for our brands"
176,Our portfolio and our category is uniquely placed to do that
177,It's incumbent on us to do it
178,So that's really where our focus is
179,"35%,36% of the cereal consumption in the U.S"
180,today happens outside of the breakfast occasion
181,That trend's only increasing and will only continue to increase as you think of demographics and age cohorts going forward here
182,And so we are agnostic to what time of day
183,we communicate the benefits of our foods
184,"And we'll communicate to everybody, wherever they are throughout the day, these benefits"
185,"We've had great success with some of our kid brands against millennials in certain dayparts, like the evening, and we will continue to drive our portfolio where it makes sense to fit people's days"
186,"The final thing I'll mention is we do need to still bring transformational innovation to cereal, okay, and to the breakfast occasion, which means investing more, maybe, in new alternatives in the area of digestive health and/or convenience"
187,And we're working hard on that
188,"And hopefully, you'll see some transformational innovation ideas come out of our company over the next few months here"
189,that show that we are investing to grow our business across these key categories
