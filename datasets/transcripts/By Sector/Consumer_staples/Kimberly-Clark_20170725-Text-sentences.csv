0,"Good morning, everyone"
1,Let me start with the headlines for the quarter
2,"Sales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year"
3,"We delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook"
4,"And finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan"
5,"Now let's take a look at the details, starting with sales"
6,"Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales"
7,Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes
8,"On profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year"
9,"Operating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points"
10,"While margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall"
11,"Commodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs"
12,Our teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings
13,Second quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million
14,Our original target was for savings of at least $400 million
15,"Given the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending"
16,"On the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year"
17,"Lower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate"
18,Now let's take a look at cash flow
19,"Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations"
20,"Cash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year"
21,"Second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days"
22,"We're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year"
23,"We also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range"
24,"On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million"
25,We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion
26,"Looking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices"
27,Organic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere
28,"Personal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points"
29,"The improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs"
30,"In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America"
31,"Overall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points"
32,The results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs
33,"In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies"
34,"K-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points"
35,The comparison included benefits from cost savings
36,"So in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity"
37,"Nonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways"
38,I'll now turn the call back over to Tom
39,"Yeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target"
40,"And what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere"
41,"When you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products"
42,"And year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well"
43,I continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward
44,"So good performance there, and"
45,I think more opportunity there
46,Sure
47,"On the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year"
48,We're on track with that
49,"And in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize"
50,"And the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year"
