0,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone"
1,I will start on slide 5 and our U.S
2,I think George covered off the key macro drivers
3,"In the end, we saw favorable pricing primarily in cheese that was more than offset by the volume/mix decline from consumption weakness across categories"
4,"Foodservice, cheese, meats and nuts were the categories most affected and they offset ongoing solid gains from Lunchables, frozen meals, and macaroni & cheese"
5,"Moving to EBITDA, we had incremental Integration savings, just less than $100 million"
6,"Note that in Q1, the pace of net savings versus the prior year was consistent with our expectations and we do expect that pace to pick up more in the second half of the year"
7,"In the first quarter however, the incremental savings together with pricing were more than offset by both the decline in volume/mix and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable key commodity costs in coffee and bacon"
8,"Although I would note that, versus last year, adjusted EBITDA was down only 1.4%, considering we were up against significant key commodity costs favorability in Q1 last year"
9,Let's turn to slide 6 and Canada
10,"Bernardo mentioned, Canada's Q1 results versus the prior year were significantly impacted by later-than-usual go-to-market agreements with key retailers"
11,As a result (16:03) was a double-digit decline in volume/mix from a combination of reduced in-store activity and a related decline in shipments
12,"At EBITDA, we had a slightly greater percentage decline than what we saw in organic net sales, reflecting the volume/mix decline and change to promotional levels versus the prior year"
13,"That being said, I think there are three important factors to consider as we move forward"
14,"First, we had significantly favorable pricing relative to local input costs within Q1 EBITDA last year"
15,"Second, despite the headwinds seen in this Q1, Canada's adjusted EBITDA growth is still in the double-digits on a two-year basis"
16,"And third, we are confident that the new go-to-market agreements we've reached in Canada will lead to a resumption of run rate trends in growth and profit margins for the balance of the year"
17,"That brings us to Europe on slide 7 where we saw sequential improvement in overall organic growth, including top-line growth in the UK"
18,"Strong currency headwinds continued to be a factor in reported results and net pricing declined due to timing of promotional activity, primarily in UK and Italy"
19,Volume/mix growth was driven by gains in UK condiments and sauces and this was partially offset by weakness in Italy infant nutrition as well as soup and beverage in Netherlands
20,"Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the UK gives us the confidence that the business is on the right path, and that our investments with retailers in the second half of last year are now paying off"
21,"At adjusted EBITDA, we had solid constant currency gains from strong cost favorability, mainly manufacturing savings that more than offset unfavorable input costs in local currency driven by transactional currency headwinds"
22,"Going forward in Europe, while we expect further improvement to our performance in the marketplace and across geographies, we expect Q2 organic top line and EBITDA to be held back by two factors: one, is shipments phasing versus the prior year where some July shipments were pulled into June last year; the second is the likelihood of unfavorable product costs as we will continue to face transactional foreign exchange headwinds within our supply chain in the near-term"
23,"Finally, let's look at our Rest of the World segment on slide 8 where results were consistent with expectations we laid out on our last call"
24,"Specifically, our plan for 2017 called for us to go after growth opportunities aggressively and would include significant incremental investments in marketing, go-to-market capabilities and product development that would hold back margins"
25,And Q1 reflected the first stage of this plan
26,"At volume/mix, we had positive on base performance in both China and from condiments and sauces in Latin America"
27,We also had favorable shipments related to the timing of Ramadan in Indonesia that were offset by actions we took to realign our distributor network in several countries and mainly affected our exports business
28,"In the end, we are encouraged by seeing our investments paying off, from condiments and sauces across Latin America, and on a more local basis, a strong organic growth in China, India, Korea, and the Middle East and Africa"
29,"At EBITDA, the strong contribution from volume/mix growth was offset by two factors: one, significant commercial investments in marketing and sales to drive top-line growth in our EMEA region; and two, higher input costs in local currency, particularly affecting our business in India, Egypt and Nigeria"
30,"Looking forward, while we expect our investments to continue as a headwind to EBITDA through the second quarter, we also expect organic sales growth to accelerate from Q1 levels as the year progresses"
31,"That concludes our review of Q1 results, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of the year"
32,"To begin, there is no doubt that the headwinds we've highlighted before will remain, from highly competitive retail markets to persistent foreign exchange headwinds, especially in Europe here in Q2."
33,"But these factors are likely to affect everybody in our industry, not just Kraft Heinz"
34,"That said, we are expecting profitable organic sales growth to ramp up as the year progresses, especially in the second half"
35,Why do we believe this?
36,"First, as George noted, we have a much stronger retail calendar in the U.S"
37,"for the balance of the year, beginning with better retail events in Q2."
38,"Second, we expect and have already being seeing our restoration of normal go-to-market activity in Canada, including our innovation and marketing agendas in light of having completed all agreements with key retailers"
39,"And third, we expect the positive investment-driven consumption trends in Europe, Latin America and Asia, Middle East and Africa to continue"
40,"At the profit line, we still expect the progression of our 2017 results to reflect aggressive up-front investment in growth and favorable commodity trends to be followed by a step-up in cost savings in the second half of the year"
41,"We are on track to deliver the $1.7 billion in cumulative Integration Program savings, net of inflation and business investments in North America by end of 2017."
42,"We do, however, have significant work ahead of us in order to deliver our plan"
43,"We must continue to execute our footprint related manufacturing line start-ups, which are well underway"
44,We have an extensive pipeline of Big Bets innovations in whitespace in Q2 and throughout the second half of the year
45,"And we will keep our focus on our defined strategy of investing, in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market capabilities as we ramp up the savings and efficiencies within our business"
46,"In the end, we continue to expect 2017 will be another year of sustainable profitable growth for The Kraft Heinz Company and another significant step forward in realizing our potential"
47,"And now, we'd be happy to take your questions"
48,Question-and-Answer Session
49,"Hi, Ken"
50,"Hi, this is Paulo"
51,"So, I don't remember we mentioning it during the call, but in terms of the gross margin, which is pretty much flat year-over-year, it's kind of encouraging to us given the commodity headwind that we had this quarter"
52,comparing to the prior year's first quarter
53,And also the geographic mix that we have this year with the decline of the higher margin business in North America
54,Sure
55,So if you think about – just let me step back to give more color on the main impacts we had in the quarter
56,"So pretty much our North America EBITDA declined around $40 million, $45 million"
57,The main impact we had was driven by volume mix
58,"And this impact offset the savings initiatives around the $100 million that we have, additional savings, and the pricing we got in the quarter"
59,So pretty much we had the commodity headwinds we faced this quarter being really responsible of the fact that the EBITDA decline
60,"Prior year, in the same quarter, we had a much bigger favorability than that, almost twice this size if you go back to Q1 2016."
61,"So, yes, you're right"
62,I think the majority of the cash declines we had was pretty much driven by typical seasonal working capital
63,Q1 is a quarter that we normally lose a lot of working capital due to seasonality in that
64,"And on top of that, we had inventory increase to prepare because we are preparing for all the footprint activities we are going to execute during the year"
65,So the majority of this is just the timing and we expect to recover in the following quarters
66,We're still seeing that
67,and we've said that before that we would have had investments in the Rest of the World business
68,The growth is coming and we expect the growth even to ramp up going forward
69,"And I think to better answer the questions, we're still seeing the margin there is around 20% being representative of the margin that we're going to see in this unit going forward"
70,So it's pretty much what I was saying
71,So we expect these investments happening in the first half of the year in Rest of the World
72,And we expect this pay off and start seeing better margins going back to the normal margins of the business in the second half of the year
73,That's the second stage in that we're seeing those investments
74,"Hi, Andrew"
75,This is Paulo
76,"So, to think about – the way that we think about our M&A framework, which hasn't changed since the beginning, and the framework is pretty much that we want to own brands that we'd be happy owning these brands for the long run, brands with strong equity, strong relative market share, brands that can travel"
77,"But we also analyze a lot how the business operates, the go-to-market of the business, and more important than that, how the business operates better, how they would operate better, how they grow fast being together"
78,Okay?
79,"And, of course, doing this analysis, we take everything into consideration, including all the synergies that we have, all the options that we have in terms of getting a better performance"
80,"And, again, everything that you said is always to improve our portfolio, right, when we have this type of framework"
81,"And more important and also very important is that we're always going to be very, very disciplined on price"
82,"Hi, Andrew"
83,"So, it's Paulo again"
84,"So when we're entering the second year of integration, it's much better to track for cumulative savings than trying to track a run-rate, given the structure of our savings that is net of inflation and net of investment"
85,So we ended the prior year at $1.2 billion cumulative savings
86,We are ending this first quarter at $1.2 billion level and we said that
87,and we're still in the path to get to $1.7 billion
88,"So, out of the $500 million that we expect to deliver this year additional, we delivered $100 million in the first quarter"
89,"And again, we still have $400 million to deliver going forward in the next three quarters"
90,"And again, you're right that we said that we expect additional savings – the majority of the savings to be in the second half"
91,"So hi, Pablo"
92,"So, on the first question – and let me start from there"
93,"So, the first question was about"
94,"So according to divestiture of the brands, today we feel comfortable with the brands and the capital that you operate"
95,We think we have scale and we operate well there
96,"Again, as soon as if we decide to divest any categories or any brand in any specific geography, we will communicate this properly to the market"
97,"So related to the Unilever potential transaction, we really believe that as I said in the M&A framework"
98,"it's kind of – again, if you go back here in terms of only consumer brands, brands with a strong market share, brands that can travel, similar go-to-market, similar operation, I think at the end of the day that these two segments of the consumer product goods are very similar and that's the reason why you see also many companies operating brands for consumers, sometimes food, sometimes personal care, sometimes healthcare"
99,Thank you
