28,We’re doing this by combining our knowledge of food and our ability to personalize through the use of data analytics; we’re doubling down on digital; and we’re leveraging new and ongoing partnerships to deepen our connection with customers and drive revenue

38,We’ve always believed that our customers shouldn’t have to pay higher prices just because a product is natural or organic
39,"We developed our Simple Truth brand to be honest, easy and affordable because our data told us this was a great customer need in the marketplace"
40,"Today, Simple Truth is the biggest natural and organic brand in the country by volume"
41,This market continues to provide a robust opportunity for Kroger
42,"Similarly, our culinary innovation team is bringing truly affordable and incredibly tasty meal kits to American households through our Prep+Pared offering"
43,"Just last week, we announced that we are expanding our offering of Prep+Pared to more than 50 stores in three of our divisions, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Ralphs"

47,"In the last year alone, Kroger has made more than 3 billion personalized recommendations to customers through product offers, promotions, recipes and more"
48,Data analytics is helping us win with Our Brands by identifying the best products to bring to market based on consumer behavior and taste trends
49,Research by an independent third party shows us that our customers favor Our Brands over national brands and competitor offerings
50,"The strength of Our Brands is what our customers realize Kroger quality is superior, and at a very affordable price"
51,It truly is quality without compromise
52,Customers get the best and most innovative quality at the best prices
53,We will build this momentum to be the premier private label destination in America
54,Combining our love of food with our data expertise allows us to offer content that inspires
55,We recently launched a new My Recipes feature on Kroger
56,com that serves up a personalized selection of suggested recipes
57,"The recipes offer greater diversity of meal ideas, all based on your individual purchase behavior"
58,"Our growing collection of recipes is also searchable by a variety of filters including seasonality, world cuisine, meal or dish type, and cooking style"
59,"While online recipes are not new, serving them up on a personalized recipe for your family is and customer and your family will love the new offerings"
60,And this is distinctly Kroger
61,"Personalized recipes are just one example on how we are bringing the combination of food and data together to create new and highly-relevant customer experiences, especially through digital and ecommerce"
62,Customers expect a great shopping experience and the ability to interact with us digitally or online in a seamless way
63,"Our digital efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personal, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs"

76,We will continue to focus on growing our core business to generate free cash flow and deepen our personal connection with customers
77,These changes also create opportunities to work with our existing partners to deliver more value for customers and to identify new partnerships to create alternative revenue streams
78,"Now, here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to walk you through changes to our capital allocation process and long-term guidance"
79,Mike?
80,"Thanks, Mike"
81,"I’m often reminded of the saying, “may you live in interesting times”"
82,"These are interesting times in our industry, and I know some of you wonder how Kroger can continue to thrive in such a dynamic operating environment"
83,We have a history of evolving to meet our customers’ ever-changing needs
84,The key is to proactively see where the customer is going and to proactively address the changes
85,That is what we are doing today
86,"Through innovation, Kroger is redefining the food and grocery customer experience based on our core strengths"
87,"Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization"
88,We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within one-to-two miles of our customers
89,We have a leadership team that combines deep experience with creative new talent
90,We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually
91,"In fact, we’ve been named America’s most beloved grocery store several times"
92,We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program
93,"And, we have a track record of connecting with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives, as evidenced by our team’s response to Hurricane Harvey"
94,"Now, we look forward to your questions"
95,Question-and-Answer Session
96,"Currently quarter-to-date, and this is without the hurricane effects, we would be above where we finished the second quarter"
97,and we would be closer to the high side of the guidance range
98,The reason we exclude the hurricane is because one day it’s
99,"a positive, one day"
100,it’s not because of obviously one day you will have business that’s up 100% or 200% and the next day it’s basically zero
101,"So, we just -- until we get completely through the two hurricanes and when we release third quarter, we will obviously give a lot more insight"
102,"But so far, we would be trending ahead of second quarter and closer to the top end of the range"
103,"And on changing the range, as Mike mentioned, if we left the range the same as it was before, it could have meant, we would have had positive -- negative identical, excuse me, for the second half of the year"
104,"And obviously, we wanted to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect identicals to be positive and the trends that we’re seeing so far, the identicals continue to improve"
105,"In terms of how much it encompasses, it would be everything that you mentioned plus some"
106,And as Mike mentioned in his comments on the space optimization 84.51° is helping us look across the whole store and how do we use space
107,"So, obviously, in some cases, it’s continuation of adding more fresh space"
108,"It’s also in terms of the products that we offer to the customer, every single item has to earn its right to be on the shelf and categories have to earn the right to have certain amount of allocation"
109,"So, it’s all of those things"
110,The expense would really be driven by two things
111,"One, when you make some changes, there are some equipments that you would write off"
112,"As you make the changes, there is certainly the labor and the cost in doing the changes, plus some of the equipment gets written off almost immediately"
113,"So, it’s both of those factors that is behind what Mike was mentioning"
114,"I would say, the broad comment would be, from an M&A standpoint, we would be equally as excited today as two years ago, when we find the right person to partner with"
115,"And as you know, when we look for someone to partner, we’re looking at somebody that brings things to us as much as we bring to them"
116,We would continue to be aggressively looking at anything digital that adds capabilities
117,"You may recall, in the past year and a half or so, we merged with a company called Market6 and another company called You Tech"
118,"And we were able to use in both of those situations, the 84.51° and accelerate the work that they did and accelerate some of the work that we’re doing plus brought a great amount of talent to our Company"
119,"So, we would increasingly look at curtain capabilities that somebody would bring to us and how do you partner with them in a way that would bring that capability"
120,"But for the right merger opportunity, whether it’s digital or physical, we would be as excited today as two years ago, but it would obviously have to be somebody that fit in"
121,well with where we operate and has a business that’s strong
122,"Well, as you mentioned, Ken, it’s only been a week and a half, so"
123,it’s very early in the process
124,"And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we’re really proud of the work that we started over a decade ago, and making sure natural and organic product is affordable to all customers, and we never felt like just because something is natural or organic, you should charge a premium for it"
125,"In terms of the impact, obviously, it’s way early, but there isn’t anything that would cause you to develop any point of view at all, in terms of changing trends, but it’s only been a week and a half"
126,"So, I would caveat it a million different ways"
127,"Obviously, the discussion around it has been longer than that"
128,"I don’t think -- I actually don’t look at two-year stacks very much, because I sold whatever I sold last year"
129,and I’m selling that plus more this year
130,And we feel very good about the underlying health of our business
131,"As we said in the prepared remarks and in response to questions so far, ID sales so far in the quarter are pushing the high end of the guidance range"
132,"We grew loyal households, we grew total households, we have strong market share growth and strong tonnage growth"
133,"And I would also remind you that as our brands continue to gain strength and gain a bigger share of both units and sales that comes at the expense of a lower retail ring, which winds up being a bit of a headwind to reported ID sales"
134,And we have been very aggressive with how we position those products inside of our stores
135,It’s a great question
136,and it’s hard to answer because the thing that we’re trying to do for our customers is to do it in a way that’s totally seamless
137,"So, the customer continues to come into the store and shop, so we actually get more of their total basket"
138,"So, it’s helping comps"
139,but it’s helping comps from that total customer household and how much they’re spending with us
140,"So, it’s helping identicals but"
141,it’s really hard to say ClickList is X percent of it or Y percent of it
142,"I don’t know, Mike, anything want to add?"
143,I’ll give a little bit broader answer than just your question
144,"First of all, we would talk about it in terms of our brands versus private label, because from -- and"
145,it’s something that took us longer than it should have
146,"But, if those brands, they are our brands and the customers tell us they love it and one of the things that we probably should have done years ago"
147,but we hadn’t
148,"but we actually, was much more aggressive on hiring a third-party company to do a broad test taste and quality preferences for our brands across multiple national brands and other companies’ private label programs"
149,And we always thought we were good
150,but we came out even significantly better than what we would have even thought
151,"So, it really highlighted the progress that our team has been making on improving the innovation in our brands, the variety of offerings"
152,"If you look at Simple Truth, obviously five years ago it didn’t exist; today, it continues to grow double digits"
153,"So, when you look at overall, our customers tell us they love our brands"
154,"And we continue to even get more aggressive in terms of creating additional innovation, brands, offerings within, new flavors"
155,"In terms of the potential, at this point, the only thing that I would say is it’s -- would be massive"
156,"And one of the things that we did several years ago, we went to the outside and hired a new leader for that team and"
157,about half of our team is from the outside
158,"And when you go and look at Europe, obviously, on the Our Brand product in Europe, the market shares there are significantly higher than the U.S"
159,"And we would be much more focused on how do we make sure the innovation, the quality and the offerings that we have, we earn the right for the customers to take it to that kind of level"
160,"In terms of our plant capacity, if you asked our manufacturing team, they would probably tell you they’re at almost capacity"
161,I’ve always found and we’ve always found that we always figure out ways to produce incremental product and do it very efficiently
162,"So, in terms of capacity, it is one of the great things about knowing how to operate plants, we could easily expand capacity, either through process change or additional expanding plants, things like that, whether is needed"
163,Not at this point
164,"I don’t know, Mike, if you -- not at this point"
165,"As you know, we are continuing to provide a little bit more insight than before"
166,"Yes, On the crossover with Walmart on digital, I actually don’t know the answer to that"
167,"And it’s incredibly easy to develop a shopping list with us, the work that our teams have done working with 84.51°"
168,"We do a lot of work on predicting what your shopping list will be, to make it really easy to do"
169,The one insight that I can give you
170,and we’ll have to go back and look to see the overlap on Walmart is --
171,our success on ClickList is very consistent across the country
172,You don’t see one place where it’s 1% and somewhere else
173,it’s a 100% variance of success
174,It’s pretty consistent
175,"On the Lidl, obviously, they continue to open stores"
176,"So far, what they’ve done has been pretty consistent with what we expected"
177,"And obviously, you’ve heard us talk about from a pricing standpoint, we won’t lose on price; we’re not trying to lead the market down on price, but we are not going to lose on price"
178,"The success so far in terms of being able to maintain our business and grow our business, we feel very good about the ability to compete against all the Lidl and anybody else"
179,"So, I wouldn’t say there has been any surprises so far"
180,"Obviously, they are our great competitor but there is a lot of great competitors out there"
181,"Well, as everybody on the call knows, we make our investment decisions in terms of what do we think is best for our business three to five years out and which intern means what’s best for our shareholders three to five years out"
182,There is no doubt that ClickList is a headwind on earnings currently and we’ve even continued to accelerate the speed in which we put ClickList in
183,"And so, it’s incremental headwind"
184,"We feel very comfortable, when you look at it over a three to five-year period of time"
185,Our customers will appreciate that we offer ClickList; our associates obviously in terms of being able to provide the service will be glad; and our shareholders will be glad
186,"So, we can clearly see where we’re -- there is a path where we’re indifferent on whether somebody comes into the store or shops with us on ClickList"
187,It’s you have initial paying and that would be a -- of what caused to affect the long-term guidance perspective
188,I would say it’s fairly common or fairly traditional time of a transition
189,"It’s just at anytime you go from higher prices to lower prices, the thing that gets disruptive is how quickly will people lower prices"
190,"and then the flip is the case as inflation creeps back in, how quickly will people adjust prices the other direction, to continue to protect the gross margin dollars that they would have in those products"
191,And that’s what causes the disruption in the short run as you’re cycling through the two of those
192,"I would say broad based, there isn’t anything that’s really out of the realm of what you normally see"
193,The one exception to that would be what we talked about earlier in the year relative to some low milk prices earlier in the year and eggs continue to be pretty inexpensive as well
194,"But, those would probably be the only two categories that I would hold out as maybe exceptions to the norm right now"
195,"The other thing that we have such great relationships with local agencies, almost always we would be considered part of the first responder group, because people understand that it’s important for the glossary stores to get stocks"
196,"So, our associates would be given clearance as a first responder in most cases"
197,"One CPGs, as you know, we always work with CPG partners, trying to understand how we grow our business on a combined basis"
198,"So, both of us are very focused on growing the business"
199,"I think CPGs continue to aggressively, incrementally try to work with us on helping grow their business"
200,It’s one of the things that’s nice about having the great insight we have with 84.51°
201,We partner with most CPGs in a different and more deep way that also involves product innovation
202,"So, there is no doubt, there is tremendous amount of change going on, the CPGs feel that change, and we’re working with the CPGs for both of us to grow our business"
203,"But, obviously, we’re also working and focusing on growing our business as well"
204,"Outside of that, I really wouldn’t say that it’s -- there has been a massive trend change, what do they always say in economics, all short statements are wrong"
205,"So, you give the scenario and I can find it somewhere"
206,The biggest change would be -- continue to be milk and eggs across the country; everywhere else would be puts and takes
207,The biggest thing that the 84.51° insight shows us is the customer decides where to shop based on their total experience
208,And obviously that total experience is what’s
209,"the shopping environment like,"
210,so what’s how the associates treat the customer
211,"What kind of rewards do you have, what type of personalized offers are you making, which is very hard for anybody to see that other than each one of us as a customer individually"
212,"And then, obviously from fresh product standpoint having great produce, meat, deli, dinner tonight, these kind of things"
213,"So, the thing that’s really important is the all of that together, the price, the specific price items, really each one of us would have different items that are in our biggest hot button"
214,"So, it would be factoring in all of those things in terms of how we decide where to price and how to price"
215,"And the insights, the biggest part of the insights is, it really is important to customers for their over total experience not just one dimension of the experience"
216,Yes
217,"On the milk and eggs, I just -- I didn’t -- the comment I made, I didn’t intend to infer that it changed anything from the first quarter in terms of broadening out or narrowing or anything on milk and eggs"
218,What was the second part of your question?
219,"Well, I guess, I would broaden it"
220,"We feel good about the pricing investments that we make and based on what the customers’ telling us, it continues to connect as we expected"
221,And it’s -- we feel good about it when you look at everything in total
222,"Also in some of the costs -- operating costs categories, the second quarter trends improved versus the first quarter as well"
223,"We feel very strongly that we would expect additional consolidation going forward and the consolidation will happen the way you describe, plus other ways in terms of companies merging and other thing"
224,"So, we don’t think there is any doubt that you’ll continue to see a lot of consolidation"
225,"You’ve always heard us talk about -- anything that happens, you should assume that we’ve looked at it"
226,"And if you look at what we did with Marsh, obviously those work out really well for us, because of specific trade areas that we haven’t been able to get into"
227,"And by buying some stores from somebody in that situation, you’re able to get into trade areas and leverage all your existing infrastructure"
228,"Those we always like, but they’re lumpy"
229,"So, you won’t have any for a couple of years"
230,and then you’ll have a whole bunch of them happen
231,"But, those are once that we will always be interested in and always take a look at"
232,"But, you should assume that our overall view on the merging with somebody is the same and we continue to look at stuff"
233,"If you look at natural and organic overall, it’s over $16 billion business for us on an annual basis"
234,"So, obviously, it’s an important part of our business"
235,It continues to grow strongly and we would continue to see a great opportunity in that space
236,We find more and more customers
237,"For some items, they will purchase natural organic items and other places, they will buy traditional items"
238,"And for us, what we try to do is, we don’t judge a customer on how they eat, and we try to make sure we have what the customer wants at a great value"
239,"In terms of the share of market, it depends on how you define share of market"
240,"If you look at Simple Truth, last year it was about a 1.7 billion category for us"
241,And if you look at the $16 billion in total that would obviously include some non-branded meat items and other items
242,"So, that would give you some insight in terms of share of market"
243,"If you look at grocery overall, grocery typically on units is close to 30%"
244,"So, obviously, there is still a lot of room to grow"
245,"When you look at total, we get more of the customers business and that’s what we find the reason why we are so supportive and keep working on it"
246,"In terms of the share of business, at this point, we wouldn’t give the specifics on stores and what percentage of their business is in ClickList"
247,It’s a reasonably wide range
248,And the range isn’t driven by anything that -- it’s more specific stores
249,"So, I know one store that has a pretty high percentage, it’s right off the interstate, so that store has gained a lot of new customers because it’s easy on and easy off, the interstate and their trade area for ClickList is completely different than their trade area for the store"
250,"For us, what we’ve tried to design is a business model that we know at certain percentage of business"
251,it’s more efficient to do it in store because of not having incremental asset investment
252,"At the point in time that it grows, it’s easily converted to dark stores or a freestanding warehouse facility where you put in more automation"
253,"So, what we’ve tried to do is design where we can support and partner and make money and the customers will take it to"
254,whatever percentage of our business they take it
255,and we’ll be there for them as they go
256,"So, we’ve really worked hard on having a model that’s easily scalable and scalable in terms of what percent of penetration"
257,it becomes
258,"So, thanks Alvin"
259,Okay
260,"Thanks, Alvin"
261,Thanks to everyone on the call
262,"Obviously -- hopefully you hear some of the comments that Mike and I are making, Kroger is playing to win"
263,And the things that we do are what we believe will be best when you look out three to five years for our customers and associates
264,"And what we’ve always found, when we do both of those, then, our shareholders are well rewarded as well"
265,And the business continues to generate great free cash flow and we have great opportunities in front of us
266,"So, and then one other comment, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates that are listening in"
267,"First of all, I would like to send our well wishes to the people of Huston and especially members of our Kroger family whose lives have been turned upside down by the recent hurricane and its aftermath"
268,Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are now bracing for Hurricane Irma as well
269,"Since the rains stopped in Houston, you have shown nothing can stop the strength, resilience and power of our amazing associates"
270,"Many of you stayed in or couldn’t easily leave stores, distribution centers, plants and offices and stayed overnight and worked tirelessly to not only serve our customers, but to provide food and supplies to first responders and local shelters"
271,"As a company we’ve sent nearly 2,800 semis packed with food, water and other critical supplies to the region"
272,More than 350 individual associates from all corners of the country traveled to Houston to lend their hands to help uplift the community
273,Having a physical presence and truly being part of a community is always important
274,This is perhaps never more apparent than when natural disasters strike
275,You and our stores are a vital part of the communities we serve
276,What I’m most proud of is how you’ve taken care of each other
277,"Whether that’s giving a hug to someone who needs it or traveling across the country to work side by side in reopening our stores and warehouse, we take care of each other, it’s who we are"
278,"Each day we open our doors and welcome our neighbors with true hospitality and generosity, and together, we make the world a better place"
279,Thank you for all you do in big ways and small ways to feed the human spirit
280,We are truly Kroger Strong
281,That completes our call today
