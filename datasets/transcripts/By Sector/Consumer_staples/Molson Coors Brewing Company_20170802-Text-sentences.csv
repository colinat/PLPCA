50,With the dynamic tax environment in the U.S
51,"right now, we are not changing our tax rate range of 24% to 28%, but our current view is that our full year underlying tax rate will be in the top half of this range"
52,We now expect cash pension contributions in the range of $300 million to $320 million to defined benefit plans in 2017.
53,"This range is $200 million higher than our previous target, as we plan to make an additional discretionary contribution of $200 million to our U.S"
54,plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goal
55,"Rating agencies treat pension under-funded status the same as debt, so this pension contribution will also benefit our investment-grade debt ratings"
56,"Note that all of these anticipated pension contributions are included in our 2017 underlying free cash flow target of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%"
57,This discretionary contribution is a strong indication of the progress we are making in achieving our financial plans and quickly paying down debt
58,We remain committed to reducing our leverage ratio to about four times on a rating-agency basis by the end of 2018.
59,"Looking forward, we are focused on three primary financial targets – first, cash generation; we made great progress in this area in the second quarter, and we are confident that we will achieve our cash goals this year"
60,"Second, deleverage; we reduced our net debt by more than $520 million in the second quarter"
61,"And third, we continue to expect the underlying EBITDA margin growth to average between 30 basis points and 60 basis points for the next three years to four years, while we remain focused on growing our top line, as well"
62,"At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for the business outlook, wrap up and the Q&A"
63,"Hi, Judy"
64,"So, just a couple of things"
65,"As I've said before, my priority is to generate free cash flow as quickly as possible, so that we can deleverage, and we've made that commitment to the rating agencies to be around four times by the end of 2018."
66,"So, U.S"
67,", I mean, we are generating stronger free cash flow and that has allowed us to make this incremental contribution to our U.S"
68,"So, that is the U.S"
69,So I do want to remind you that pension contributions are deductible for tax
70,That $200 million in gross
71,You would need to tax effect that to get the net number
72,"And then, the other part that goes in to our free cash flow is obviously our working capital and the timing of working capital does play into the guidance that we've given of the $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%"
73,"And in terms of looking forward to 2018, we're not ready to give guidance here for 2018."
74,We will do that early in 2018 to help with that
75,"So, Judy, look, we – our cost savings and synergy plans are on track"
76,"And so, we are pleased that we are delivering the cost savings"
77,"We have, as you rightly mentioned, we've said that for 2017, it is going to be more than the $175 million"
78,"However, we are not breaking that up quarter-by-quarter because that number does fluctuate and this is for the full year, it will be more than $175 million"
79,and we are very pleased with our plan so far to deliver the $550 million over the three years
80,"So, hi, Steve"
81,"So, the additional contributions that we made is to the U.S"
82,plan
83,"So, it is pulling forward next year's contributions"
84,We had an opportunity to do that
85,"However, the U.S"
86,isn't the only pension plan
87,"So, I don't want to say that there won't be any further contributions to pension plans, but this one is a pull forward for the U.S"
88,plans
89,"Having said that, there's a number of things that enter our decisions as to the amount to contribute to our pension plans, and one of those is market performance against our assets"
90,"So, depending on how the assets perform, will also tell us how much we need to contribute"
91,"And then just going forward, we're not going to give any contribution guidance at this stage, but we will do that again early next year, depending again as how our assets and our plan performs"
92,"So, a couple of things maybe just to keep in mind"
93,"So, Gavin did mentioned the fourth quarter of last year for the U.S"
94,"Just to give a number around that, we're cycling in Q4 for MillerCoors, and a pre-tax income increase of 42%"
95,"So, that's a big headwind for us in Q4."
96,The other thing just to mention is we – in Q3 we're cycling one more quarter of the Canada brand amortization
97,If you recall in Q4 of last year we reclassified some of our brands to definite lives
98,"So, we've got one more quarter of that cycle in Q3."
99,And then the other thing just to mention from a Canada point of view
100,is the COGS per hectoliter last year in Q4
101,"was actually a reduction, so recycling very positive performance in Q4 of last year"
102,And then another headwind just to consider is we do have the higher corporate cost as you mentioned
103,"We are investing, for example, behind our global business services that we opened in May in Romania, and we're investing behind the shared service center that we'll be keeping in Milwaukee"
104,"So, there is a couple of costs to consider for this year that we will be investing and also cycling some performance"
105,"And then, again, just to remind you, the 30 basis points to 60 basis points, we do look at that over a longer term, so three years to four years"
106,"So, yes"
