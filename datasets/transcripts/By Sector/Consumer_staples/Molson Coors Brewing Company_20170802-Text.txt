Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody
Following are our consolidated financial headlines for the second quarter versus pro forma results a year ago, except for cash flow, which is reported on an actual basis
Global net sales per hectoliter grew 1.7% in constant currency, driven by the U.S
, Canada and Europe
Worldwide total brand volume increased 2.3%, due to strong growth in Europe and International, partially as a result of adding the Miller global brands business, but also from growth in some of our core brands
Our global priority brands grew 4.6%
GAAP net income increased 4%, and underlying non-GAAP net income increased 2.9%, driven by increased brand volume, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, cost savings and lower marketing spending, partially offset by a higher underlying effective tax rate
This non-GAAP result was up nearly 50% on a reported basis, which demonstrates the substantial earnings accretion from the MillerCoors transaction
In the second quarter, we reported nearly $794 million of underlying EBITDA, a 4.2% increase from the pro forma result a year ago
In constant currency, underlying EBITDA was up 5.7%
Year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $586.7 million, which more than tripled versus $176.9 million in the first half of 2016. This significant increase was driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows, as well as lower cash paid for taxes, which were partially offset by higher cash paid for interest
With this strong free cash flow, we reduced our net debt by more than $522 million in the second quarter
Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights for the second quarter
, we grew net sales and underlying EBITDA on a pro forma basis, with 7.9% earnings growth driven by lower MG&A expenses, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, and cost savings
domestic net sales per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 1% for the quarter as a result of higher net pricing and positive sales mix, partially offset by cycling a multi-year adjustment in federal excise tax expense last year
Cycling this adjustment in federal excise tax reduced our NSR per hectoliter by 40 basis points this quarter
Overall, U.S
STRs declined 1.9%, but against the backdrop of a weak industry, we achieved our best first-half market share trend in more than three years
STRs were particularly soft late in the second quarter, which drove moderately higher than planned inventories for our distributors at the end of the quarter, but also lower out of stocks around the 4th of July holiday
We expect the majority of this additional inventory to be sold through by the end of the third quarter
We grew our share of the Premium Light segment, with Coors Light achieving its ninth consecutive quarter of increased segment share and Miller Lite reaching 11 consecutive quarters of increased segment share
Overall, our Premium Light segment volumes were down low-single digits
Coors Banquet grew volume at a mid-single-digit rate and also increased segment share
Our total Above Premium segment returned to growth, up low-single digits, driven by both our regional and national craft brands
Blue Moon Belgian White, Leinenkugel's, and Peroni grew strongly, while Redd's and Henry's posted lower volume
Zima, which returned to the U.S
market for a limited period, was Nielsen's number five growth brand for the four weeks ending July, the 1st
Our below-premium brands were down low-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, a significant trend improvement from the last – the past several years
Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 9.7% on a reported basis, primarily due to the impact of lower volume, input cost inflation, and negative foreign currency movements
Underlying EBITDA in constant currency was 7.2% lower
Overall Canada brand volume declined 1.3%, as a result of lower domestic volumes, partially driven by soft industry volume
Including the return of the Miller brands to our portfolio, we increased overall market share for the second consecutive quarter
Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter
Nonetheless, we continued to drive our First Choice agenda, including revenue management strategies, to bring momentum back to the top line
As a result, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 2.3%, driven by positive pricing and brand mix, primarily due to higher import brand volume
We continued to premiumize our portfolio through volume and market share gains by import brands led by Coors Banquet; above-premium craft brands including Belgian Moon and Granville Island; and the addition of the Miller brands
Europe grew underlying EBITDA 13.8%, which equates to 21.3% growth in constant currency, driven by higher volume, positive sales mix, the quarterly timing of marketing investments, increased net pension benefits, and the later timing of the Easter holiday this year
These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements
Brand volume increased 11.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the transfer of royalty and export brand volume across Europe from our International business and the addition of the Miller brands, along with the timing of Easter and strong growth from our core and above-premium brands
Net sales per hectoliter increased 3.7% in local currency due to positive mix and net pricing
Underlying EBITDA for our International business was a loss of $0.9 million, which improved from a loss of $1.7 million a year ago
Brand volume increased more than 40% in the second quarter to 1.2 million hectoliters
Our second quarter net sales grew more than 65% due to higher volume, along with positive pricing, while net sales per hectoliter declined 5.5% due to sales mix changes
This increase was driven by the transfer of our Puerto Rico business from MillerCoors, the addition of the Miller global brands, and Coors Light growth in Latin America, partially offset by the transfer of Europe royalty and export business to the Europe segment
In Latin America, excluding the addition of Puerto Rico, we grew Coors Light volume at a high-single-digit rate
The Miller brands integration process is continuing to progress as expected, and we have successfully exited almost all of our Transitional Service Agreements during the second quarter
In each of these instances, we have established routes to market that give us a strong platform for growth
Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the second quarter, as well as our latest outlook and guidance targets
This quarter, we have made the following adjustments to our guidance metrics: We now expect cost of goods sold per hectoliter for the full year 2017 in our International business to decrease at a mid-single-digit rate, versus a double-digit decrease previously
With the dynamic tax environment in the U.S
right now, we are not changing our tax rate range of 24% to 28%, but our current view is that our full year underlying tax rate will be in the top half of this range
We now expect cash pension contributions in the range of $300 million to $320 million to defined benefit plans in 2017. This range is $200 million higher than our previous target, as we plan to make an additional discretionary contribution of $200 million to our U.S
plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goal
Rating agencies treat pension under-funded status the same as debt, so this pension contribution will also benefit our investment-grade debt ratings
Note that all of these anticipated pension contributions are included in our 2017 underlying free cash flow target of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%
This discretionary contribution is a strong indication of the progress we are making in achieving our financial plans and quickly paying down debt
We remain committed to reducing our leverage ratio to about four times on a rating-agency basis by the end of 2018. Looking forward, we are focused on three primary financial targets – first, cash generation; we made great progress in this area in the second quarter, and we are confident that we will achieve our cash goals this year
Second, deleverage; we reduced our net debt by more than $520 million in the second quarter
And third, we continue to expect the underlying EBITDA margin growth to average between 30 basis points and 60 basis points for the next three years to four years, while we remain focused on growing our top line, as well
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for the business outlook, wrap up and the Q&A
Hi, Judy
So, just a couple of things
As I've said before, my priority is to generate free cash flow as quickly as possible, so that we can deleverage, and we've made that commitment to the rating agencies to be around four times by the end of 2018. So, U.S
, I mean, we are generating stronger free cash flow and that has allowed us to make this incremental contribution to our U.S
So, that is the U.S
So I do want to remind you that pension contributions are deductible for tax
That $200 million in gross
You would need to tax effect that to get the net number
And then, the other part that goes in to our free cash flow is obviously our working capital and the timing of working capital does play into the guidance that we've given of the $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%
And in terms of looking forward to 2018, we're not ready to give guidance here for 2018. We will do that early in 2018 to help with that
So, Judy, look, we – our cost savings and synergy plans are on track
And so, we are pleased that we are delivering the cost savings
We have, as you rightly mentioned, we've said that for 2017, it is going to be more than the $175 million
However, we are not breaking that up quarter-by-quarter because that number does fluctuate and this is for the full year, it will be more than $175 million and we are very pleased with our plan so far to deliver the $550 million over the three years
So, hi, Steve
So, the additional contributions that we made is to the U.S
plan
So, it is pulling forward next year's contributions
We had an opportunity to do that
However, the U.S
isn't the only pension plan
So, I don't want to say that there won't be any further contributions to pension plans, but this one is a pull forward for the U.S
plans
Having said that, there's a number of things that enter our decisions as to the amount to contribute to our pension plans, and one of those is market performance against our assets
So, depending on how the assets perform, will also tell us how much we need to contribute
And then just going forward, we're not going to give any contribution guidance at this stage, but we will do that again early next year, depending again as how our assets and our plan performs
So, a couple of things maybe just to keep in mind
So, Gavin did mentioned the fourth quarter of last year for the U.S
Just to give a number around that, we're cycling in Q4 for MillerCoors, and a pre-tax income increase of 42%
So, that's a big headwind for us in Q4. The other thing just to mention is we – in Q3 we're cycling one more quarter of the Canada brand amortization
If you recall in Q4 of last year we reclassified some of our brands to definite lives
So, we've got one more quarter of that cycle in Q3. And then the other thing just to mention from a Canada point of view is the COGS per hectoliter last year in Q4 was actually a reduction, so recycling very positive performance in Q4 of last year
And then another headwind just to consider is we do have the higher corporate cost as you mentioned
We are investing, for example, behind our global business services that we opened in May in Romania, and we're investing behind the shared service center that we'll be keeping in Milwaukee
So, there is a couple of costs to consider for this year that we will be investing and also cycling some performance
And then, again, just to remind you, the 30 basis points to 60 basis points, we do look at that over a longer term, so three years to four years
So, yes
