0,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning"
1,"Before I get into the quarter, let me provide more details on the malware incident and where we currently stand in our recovery"
2,"On June 27, like many other companies, we were globally impacted by an unprecedented malware incident"
3,"For the last four days of the quarter and into the third quarter, we had limited ability to ship and invoice customers in many markets"
4,"Thankfully, our teams managed to keep many of our manufacturing facilities running, which was a critical accomplishment"
5,We executed our business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact of the incident and minimize business disruption with a focus on consumers and customers
6,"Over the past four weeks, we've worked tirelessly to restore our systems and recover from the disruption"
7,"Although we've now restored the majority of our affected systems, in a few cases, parts of our supply chain have still not fully recovered, and we anticipate some impacts in our third quarter"
8,We'll also incur some additional one-time costs related to the incident during the second half
9,"In terms of our results, the malware incident had a negative impact of approximately 240 basis points to organic net revenue, or about $140 million"
10,"We expect to recover a majority of the delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter, and we've made good progress in shipping these orders during the month of July"
11,"We did, however, permanently lose some revenue due to shorter supply chains, mispromotions and lost consumption in some markets"
12,"That said, we do not believe the incident has had any long-term impact to our customer relationships or market share"
13,We're pleased with our execution during this crisis and believe that our business continuity plans were effective in minimizing the impact to our customers and to our ongoing financial results
14,"As you can imagine, we are conducting a comprehensive review of the incident to determine any potential opportunities to further improve the security of our global systems environment"
15,"Currently, we do not expect the required investments to be material to our results"
16,This event has underscored the resiliency of our team and their ability to pull together in the face of adversity
17,I'd like to thank our teams for their tireless efforts to put us back on track and ensure that we're focused most importantly on our customers and consumers
18,"As Irene stated, our second quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, absent the malware incident and the transition impact of the India GST, which were a combined headwind of 260 basis points to our top line growth"
19,"Excluding these items, our organic net revenue growth would have been essentially flat"
20,The impact of these incidents masked solid results in a number of areas
21,"For instance, our global e-commerce net revenues continued to grow strongly, up 30%"
22,"In Europe, we executed well overall and especially in our chocolate business"
23,And several of our emerging markets are stabilizing and have an improving macro outlook
24,"We're delivering solid results in countries such as India, Vietnam and Mexico, where market fundamentals are improving, and our momentum is strong"
25,Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance
26,Q2 marked another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion as we continued to aggressively reduce cost
27,"Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 90 basis points"
28,"Our progress was driven by improved SG&A as we continued to execute our Zero-Based Budgeting program, which delivered cost reductions in both overheads and advertising spend"
29,We expect our advertising and consumer promotion spending will be about flat for the total year as we move some spending to the second half
30,"Adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points as continued solid net productivity and better pricing were offset by unfavorable mix and higher input costs, especially in dairy"
31,We continue to see gross margin improvements as a key enabler to delivering our 2018 margin expansion commitments
32,"For the first half, adjusted OI margin was 16.3%, and we remain on track to deliver our mid-16% outlook for the year"
33,"I do want to note that we decided to adjust out the incremental costs associated with the malware incident in the quarter, representing about $7 million"
34,"As I said, we will incur additional one-time costs in the second half as well but do not expect them to be material at this point"
35,Let me now turn to our regional performance
36,We continue to see solid trends underlying the results in three of our four regions
37,Europe posted another strong quarter of margin expansion with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 220 basis points to 19%
38,"Strong net productivity, lower A&C costs and continued overhead reductions drove the improvement"
39,"Organic net revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 220 basis points due to the malware incident"
40,"Despite this impact, Europe delivered solid vol/mix growth in both chocolate and biscuits, and our chocolate business performance was led by Germany and Russia"
41,"Our Europe business continues to demonstrate solid operating performance, and we remain encouraged by additional growth opportunities, including in chocolate bakery and chocolate seasonals"
42,"In our large and diverse EMEA region, we continue to navigate through a mixed environment"
43,Our Asia Pacific business delivered solid results while some of our markets in the Middle East continue to be challenged
44,"Adjusted OI margin increased 230 basis points to 15.6%, driven primarily by lower A&C spend, continued overhead management and a property insurance recovery"
45,"In markets like the Middle East, we've selectively trimmed A&C spending where returns have been challenged"
46,"Organic revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 90 basis points from the transition impact of the India GST and the malware incident"
47,"Despite those impacts, we delivered strong results in India and Southeast Asia"
48,Our India business grew mid-single digits despite the impact from GST
49,"Excluding this headwind, growth would have been double-digit"
50,"Chocolate continued to be strong as we executed our plans, and the overall market conditions remained good"
51,"China posted a small decline, driven primarily by soft category trends"
52,"Our gum business continued to grow and take share, and Milka chocolate performed in line with our expectations"
53,We expect our biscuit business trajectory to improve as we relaunched Oreo this summer with both improved packaging and a new product formula
54,"Difficult economic conditions in the Middle East continue to pressure category growth, but our year-over-year comparisons are easier in the second half"
55,"In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 530 basis points to 14.3%, primarily driven by improved overhead costs and lower A&C spend, as we continue to adjust our spending levels to match the market dynamics in countries like Brazil and Argentina"
56,"Organic net revenue declined 0.5%, including a negative impact of 280 basis points from the malware incident"
57,"Mexico delivered solid growth, driven by strength in candy while Argentina implemented pricing to offset currency-driven inflation"
58,Brazil remains challenging due to continued economic weakness
59,"Our chocolate business delivered a third consecutive quarter of growth and solid share performance, while our biscuits business continued to face difficult price gaps and consumer down trading"
60,"Consistent with our discussion during our first quarter call, our North America results were challenged in Q2 as overall category growth was even lower than our tempered expectations"
61,"Adjusted OI margin declined 250 basis points to 19.2%, driven primarily by benefits in the prior year related to an asset sale"
62,"It's important to note that of all of our regions, the North America region was most impacted by the malware incident, driven by the lower trade stock levels associated with DSD"
63,"As we've said, this is also the market where we had the majority of our lost consumption due to the July 4 holiday timing"
64,"Organic net revenue declined 8%, including a negative impact of 410 basis points from the malware incident"
65,These results were driven by U.S
66,"biscuits, as well as declines in gum"
67,"As Irene mentioned, we're moving with a sense of urgency to address the issues we've identified and feel confident this business will return to growth"
68,We continue to expect to see improved results in the back half of the year
69,We have a strong second half innovation agenda in North America
70,"This includes our new VÃ©a snacks and non-GMO Triscuit crackers, both of which launched in July as well as"
71,"belVita Protein, RITZ Crisp & Thins and GOOD THiNS, which continue to gain share"
72,Our white space Oreo Milka chocolate candy is also gaining momentum with healthy velocity and stronger peak rates as we expand distribution and capacity
73,"In addition, our DSD-driven share gain plans are now beginning to play out as we'd expected"
74,"As our competitor began to transition out of its DSD system at the end of Q2 and our major customers reset their shelves, we're now capitalizing by gaining displays and share of shelf"
75,We expect this to be a key growth driver in the second half and into next year
76,"Now, let me spend a few moments providing some highlights by category"
77,"Snacking category growth was 1.5%, which was generally in line with our full year expectation"
78,We're pleased that our shares have stabilized and were roughly flat for the first half
79,You should note that these revenue growth numbers include the negative impact of the malware incident
80,"Our biscuits business posted a revenue decline as solid performance in the UK, Japan and Germany was offset by weakness in the U.S"
81,Approximately 80% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share
82,"In chocolate, our business grew 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India and Brazil"
83,We continue to see good momentum in U.S
84,"chocolate, which is now benefiting from increased capacity coming out in the second half, as well as Milka in China, which continued to perform well"
85,Approximately 60% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category
86,"Gum and candy declined approximately 7% as the gum category continued to experience significant weakness, especially in the U.S"
87,"We're planning for continued category declines while working on initiatives to stabilize share and shift focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy and mint platforms"
88,About 45% of our year-to-date revenue in gum and candy gained or held share
89,"Turning to earnings per share, in Q2, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.48, up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by our strong operating income growth"
90,We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year
91,"As you think about your models, let me remind you that our results now exclude the impact of our French confectionery and Australian cheese and grocery business divestitures that closed in April and early July, respectively"
92,These items were detailed in an 8-K we issued last week
93,These businesses account for approximately $530 million in revenue and $0.06 of EPS on an annual basis
94,The divestitures improve our growth rates while we're moving quickly to remove stranded costs associated with these actions
95,"In Q2, we returned approximately $900 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends"
96,"As we receive cash for our two recent divestitures, we're increasing our full year expectation for share repurchases to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion"
97,"In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend by 16% and are now targeting to grow our dividend faster than adjusted EPS as our improving free cash flow generation enables us to continue to fully fund our critical growth and transformation investments while also deploying more capital to shareholders"
98,Now to our outlook
99,"Overall, our outlook is unchanged for the full year"
100,Our organic net revenue growth target remains at least 1%
101,We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis
102,"As you think about your models for the next two quarters, remember that Q4 is seasonally a higher revenue quarter and will be higher than Q3 even after the impact of the additional malware incident related shipments"
103,"You'll note that we're absorbing the dilution from the two divestitures, but we're also adjusting our outlook for interest expense for the year, and the two items roughly offset one another"
104,"And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year as we see lower CapEx, improved margins and good working capital efficiency"
105,"With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments before we take your questions"
106,"Hey, Andrew"
107,"And I think, Andrew, as you look at some of the July data, it will be a little messy because of some of the malware shipment timing issues"
108,"But again, at the individual retail or account level, we feel very good about the progress"
109,"Hey, Chris"
110,Yeah
111,"Look, you're talking globally?"
112,"Yeah, look, there's no question as we think about the second half"
113,So you can do the math on what we need to do in the second half to get to at least one
114,That's still â we need a good second half
115,"The malware incident has created a headwind, and I would say it does make that target a little bit tougher as we talked a little bit about some of the third quarter challenges"
116,But I'll give you a few reasons to believe that we feel good about the second half
117,Three of our four regions are actually executing well and don't really need a significant change in trajectory as we look at the second half
118,The second thing is we will ship through the majority of the Q2 malware shipments
119,"And again, July, we did the majority of that and feel good about that"
120,"We also, as Irene talked a bit about North America, we have good confidence in North America having a much better second half, and it's about the DSD opportunity"
121,"It's about the pipeline of health and wellness opportunities that we're pursuing, and it's about the execution of the team as we've had leadership in place there"
122,"So, those are really the drivers that I think we feel good about it"
123,"There's the VÃ©a, the Triscuit and the share gains that we'll have, and we think that will also help the category growth in North America"
124,"And then in general, I think as you look at the second half, we have easier compares"
125,You got India demonetization
126,You've got some of the weakness we saw and trade stock dynamics playing out of the Middle East that I think will help us in the second half as we look at compares
127,"So look I think we feel pretty good about the opportunity to have a much better second half, and those are the real drivers"
128,"I think we expect â it was around 9% for the first half, which is slightly down from where we were in the first half of last year, but roughly in the range of where we've been as we look at the last six quarters or so"
129,"For the full year, I would say we'll be approximately flat"
130,"So, we will have a little bit of timing and more A&C spending in the second half"
131,"We continue to distort that spending, obviously, to Power Brands and to markets where we're seeing the growth opportunity, and therefore, we've taken it out of some"
132,Digital mix continues to be a priority
133,We're projected to be at 30% of our spend on digital
134,We still think that makes lots of sense
135,"And again, as I said, given the innovation initiatives that we have in the back half, that will drive some of the spending that we have lined up for the second half"
136,"You got it, Chris"
137,"Hi, Ken"
138,"Sure, Alexia"
139,"Yeah, I mean, gross margins were down slightly in the quarter, and that's sort of the trend we've had over the last few quarters"
140,"The net productivity, the supply chain reinvention work is executing well"
141,We're delivering strong net productivity
142,So that's not the challenge
143,"I would say, clearly, we lost some volume leverage in the quarter as it related to the malware issue, and the pricing dynamic, pricing in general was positive, and the reality is most of that was driven by some of the inflationary economies like Argentina and Egypt, Nigeria"
144,"Those are big, big drivers where we had significant pricing"
145,There's a couple of places where we have seen trade spending and incremental pricing challenges
146,You call out the U.S
147,I would just say in the U.S
148,", that pricing has been more or less tied to some of the DSD opportunities as we position to gain some market share and take shelf space"
149,"Obviously, that's part of the equation and just something that we had expected to do"
150,So we've been appropriately investing there
151,"So again, I would just close by saying I think gross margins will continue to be a key element as we look at the margin expansion"
152,"And again, we have a full portfolio of programs we're driving around productivity that we expect will deliver over the next multiple quarters here"
153,"Clearly, we've seen cocoa drop, but as you know, it's more than cocoa in the portfolio"
154,Dairy has been a challenge
155,"Even cocoa butter has been a challenge, wheat and sugar"
156,There're some other things moving the other way
157,"Right now, in the first half of the year, commodities were a pressure, and they were a pressure versus what we even had in our plans"
158,"As we go to the second half, not significant changes, as we're mostly hedged for a lot of those commodities, and dairy, as I think you know, there's not a lot of liquidity, and you can't really hedge that exposure"
159,"So as you head into 2018, based on what we see right now, there's a bit of relief"
160,"But obviously, you have to work through the pricing dynamics, and it's a complex equation"
161,"But we are, as we've talked about, disproportionately moving investments and building route-to-market capability and distribution around channels that are growing faster"
162,"So acknowledging that there are some unmeasured channels that clearly may provide more growth is something we've done and clearly, putting some investment there is part of our strategy"
163,Consumption for Easter was â
164,yeah
165,We said (45:59) in the first quarter was somewhere closer to 1%
166,So it's 1% to 1.5% is about what we're seeing pretty consistently
167,"I think, Rob, it's still just a little bit early"
168,I hope you can sense our optimism and positive energy around it
169,"I think, clearly, we're in the middle of shelf resets now, and you'll start to see that play out as you move through August and into September"
170,"And as I said a little bit earlier, there is a bit of noise because of some of the shift in timing and what played into July, and how that may have affected some of the shelf resets, and we're working through that now"
171,But I'm not going to provide details
172,"I mean, obviously, there's a competitive sensitivity to sharing some of that data as well"
173,"You'll see it play out, but I think it'll play out as you get through the third quarter into the fourth quarter, I think it'll be much clearer in some of that reported data"
174,That's what I would say
175,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
176,LLC
177,"So your confidence then, Brian, is because you have commitments like verbal commitments from customers to make these changes?"
178,"In many cases, yes"
179,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
180,LLC
181,Okay
182,"Hey, John"
183,"Is that chocolate specifically, Steve, or just broadly?"
184,"Yeah, So one of the things I said in the prepared comments was we have added capacity that that's come online even in the last few weeks, and we now have the capability in the U.S"
185,to accelerate some of our distribution expansion
186,"So you'll see a broader footprint and a bigger market position for Oreo,"
187,Milka as that capacities come on
188,based capacity
189,"We will likely, as this business grows and we continue to invest, need to have a discussion around where we put incremental capacity beyond that, and that's something that we probably phase into within the next probably 12 months as we think about that business"
190,"But we're not there yet, and we've got plenty of capacity to drive the growth that we have for the second half and into next year"
