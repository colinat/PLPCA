2,Organic revenue was up 2% globally
3,"We delivered positive volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages, along with positive net price realization"
4,And core constant currency EPS grew 7%
5,"And despite the macro volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our organic revenue growth was driven by our developing and emerging markets businesses, with mid-single-digit organic revenue gains"
6,"We are particularly encouraged by the broad-based gains we saw in our two largest developing and emerging markets, Mexico and Russia, where growth across snacks, beverages and dairy led to high single-digit organic revenue growth in each of these important markets"
7,"And the developed markets, we grew organic revenue 1%, led by solid performance of Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages"
8,"And we delivered this performance despite facing a few headwinds, including: the timing of the New Year holiday, which fell into the 53rd week of our 2016 fiscal year; a later Easter this year; and the delay of U.S"
9,income tax refunds that dampened Q1 consumer spending across virtually every consumer category
10,"With Q1 coming in line with our expectations, we remain confident in the full year"
11,2017 outlook
12,"we shared with you last quarter,"
13,"namely, organic revenue growth of at least 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 8%"
14,We are proud of the strength and consistency of our performance over the years and we expect 2017 to be yet another strong year of achievement
15,"As I wrote in my annual letter to shareholders, our performance has been enabled, in large part, by our anticipation of and response to far-reaching demographic environmental and societal shifts"
16,"For more than a decade, it has been clear to us that if we wanted to make our future as bright as our past, we needed to transform our company in a number of critical ways"
17,"With changing consumer preferences reflecting a growing shift towards healthier lifestyles, we needed to continue to transform our portfolio to offer more nutritious products"
18,"With increasing strains on natural resources and the increasing importance governments are placing on protecting our planet, we needed to transform our operations to limit our environmental footprint"
19,"And we're changing attitudes, values and demographics in the workplace, especially as Millennials enter the workforce in large numbers"
20,We needed to transform our workplace and our culture to make sure we were meeting the evolving expectations of a new generation of associates
21,The urgency of responding to these shifts is what gave rise to the approach we call Performance with Purpose
22,"From the start, Performance with Purpose has been more than a slogan"
23,"It's been an overarching vision, guiding every aspect of our business"
24,It's about building a healthier future for all our stakeholders
25,"Of course, this begins with generating healthy financial returns for our owners, but that is just the table stakes"
26,Our challenge is to deliver them consistently and sustainably year after year
27,"And the way we are doing this is by continuing to transform in five areas: first, making healthier foods and beverages for our consumers"
28,"To meet the evolving needs of our consumers around the world, we are shifting our portfolio to a wider range of what we call: first, Everyday Nutrition products, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea; and two, what we call guilt-free products, which includes the Everyday Nutrition products plus beverages with 70 calories or less from added sugar per 12-ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat"
29,"As a result, today, more than 45% of our net revenue is derived from guilt-free products"
30,And our Everyday Nutrition portfolio is growing faster than the balance of the portfolio
31,"This transformation has been enabled by a series of critical investments in R&D that are paving the way for new flavors and sweeteners, as well as ingredients and recipes"
32,"And we are also investing in advanced manufacturing technologies, like our proprietary frying innovation that can reduce the amount of fat in potato chips by 20%"
33,You see our commitment to our product transformation and our recent innovation around the globe
34,"For example, in North America, we just launched LIFEWTR, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste"
35,The brand fuses creativity with design to serve as a source of inspiration by featuring the works of some of today's top visual artists on the package
36,We also launched LEMON LEMON
37,"It's a sparkling lemonade, a modern take on an old tradition with bubbles, lemon juice and a touch of sweeteners, with just 70 calories per 12-ounce serving"
38,"We launched IZZE FUSIONS, a next-generation sparkling beverage, modernized with unique flavors and just 60 calories per 12-ounce serving"
39,"And we're expanding the lineup of our highly-successful Smartfood Delight popcorn, that contains just 35 calories per cup"
40,"It's made with air-popped 100% whole grain popcorn, contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives and offers gluten-free and non-GMO project verified varieties"
41,"In Brazil, we are launching new Quaker fruit bars made with oats and real fruit"
42,"Quaker fruit bars are just 60 calories per serving, have no added sugar, has zero trans fats and are a source of fiber and Vitamin C"
43,"In Russia, our J7 whole fruit line, containing 100% fruit juice and nectars with the fiber of a whole fruit, hit the market earlier this year"
44,"In Mexico, we are expanding our global Sunbites franchise with the launch of three product forms, multi-grain chips, popcorn and plantains"
45,"And in the UK, we launched Quaker Super Goodness in two forms, SuperGrains and Super Fruits, both made with 100% whole-grain oats with beta glucan, which has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels"
46,And we believe there is much more room to grow in the space
47,"For example, working with our retail partners, Quaker Foods North America has the opportunity to return to growth by leveraging one of the most beloved nutrition distribution brands to renew excitement in the center of the store through innovative merchandising"
48,The second area is generating healthy growth for our retail and foodservice partners
49,"As a result of all the investments we have made to position ourselves for success over the long term, from anticipating consumer trends to building a robust innovation pipeline, to transforming our product portfolio to meet consumers' needs, we are delivering top-tier growth for our retailers"
50,"For the third consecutive year, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to branded retail food and beverage sales growth in the U.S"
51,"In fact, in 2016, we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined"
52,We're driving growth by leveraging our global scale and driving excellent local in-market execution
53,"For example, in 2016, we placed with our retail partners more than 250,000 single-serve displays dedicated to our fastest-growing brands with our best innovation, driving growth in single-serve beverages for our retail partners and us"
54,"By implementing the GES model pioneered Frito-Lay, our North America Beverage unit is improving order accuracy, reducing out-of-stocks and driving even greater levels of in-store service"
55,"To drive growth with our foodservice partners, in just one year, we placed"
56,"20,000 Hello Goodness branded vending units that offer consumers access to foods and beverages from across the PepsiCo portfolio that meet certain nutrition criteria"
57,"And we are building a powerhouse e-commerce team, creating global capability in markets from the U.S"
58,to China to the UK and tailoring that capability with retailers to fit their growth strategy
59,"Third, we are contributing to a healthier planet while boosting our bottom line"
60,"One of the central planks of Performance with Purpose, the vision we set out over a decade ago, has been protecting our planet and conserving natural resources"
61,"We continue to advance these efforts in a number of ways, including responsible water use, shrinking our carbon footprint across our supply chain and reducing our waste and packaging material, not only because it's the right thing to do, because it's the smart thing to do for business"
62,"I am pleased to report that globally, approximately one-third of our plants have now achieved near-zero waste landfill while reducing, reusing or recycling their waste"
63,And our efforts continue
64,"In January, we activated a wind turbine at our Skelmersdale plant in the UK, which is now providing 25% of the site's electricity with this renewable energy source"
65,"These and many other environmental sustainability initiatives are not only shrinking our environmental footprint, they're also substantially reducing our costs and boosting the bottom line"
66,The fourth area is creating a healthy workplace and culture for our associates
67,The extraordinary men and women who make up our company are our greatest assets
68,"That's why we're committed to remaining a place that the best and brightest come, not only to earn a living, but to build a life by fostering a healthy workplace and culture"
69,So we've undertaken a broad set of initiatives: to build a work force that's diverse and inclusive; to provide working caregivers the support and flexibility they need to meet their responsibilities at work and home; to foster learning; and to promote more effective ways to work together
70,"For example, in North American Beverages, we've declared 2017 to be the year of the frontline leader and launched frontline leader excellence training to our almost 3,000 frontline managers, with topics covering employer advocacy, time management and career building"
71,"And at Frito-Lay, we are piloting innovative programs to address the continuous need for skilled labor by creating a variety of programs aimed at skill development for our current associates as well as partnerships with local technical schools for development of future talent"
72,Our workplace and culture are more than the product of corporate policies
73,"It also reflects our values, holding ourselves to the highest standards of excellence, speaking with truth and candor and selling only products we can proudly stand behind"
74,And the fifth area is promoting healthier communities wherever we operate
75,"Although we're thought of as a global enterprise, we are also members of every local community where we do business"
76,"Our associates live there, we make our products there"
77,and we often source our raw materials there
78,"For all of these reasons, we have a stake in the local communities we serve and we work hard to meet our responsibilities to them"
79,"An important way we contribute to our communities is by creating well-paying jobs, along with the possibility of long, successful careers"
80,We are also doing our part to be a good neighbor in other ways
81,"For example, in Chicago, for over a decade, we've been the title partner of the largest high school soccer tournament in the U.S"
82,", the PepsiCo Showdown"
83,"In 2017, there are 216 Chicago area high schools and more than 21,500 student athletes involved in the event, which is built around the theme Make a Difference On AND Off the Field"
84,"Relatedly, there is a monthly community service push with the thousands of PepsiCo Showdown student athletes to cultivate leadership for a brighter future"
85,"And throughout Mexico, our Entrepreneurship for Growth program supports youngsters from vulnerable communities to improve their quality of life, to develop enough soft skills through sport and hard skills through technical education"
86,"So taken together, these steps form a virtuous cycle that's powering our ongoing transformation as a company, enabling us to do well by doing good and positioning us for success, not only over the short term but also over the long term, adding to both the durability and duration of our shareholder value creation"
87,"So net-net, we feel good about the state of our business"
88,We are on track to deliver our full-year financial targets
89,"And we are managing our business to both the short-term and the long-term in a way that delivers healthy, sustainable returns to our shareholders"
90,"With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston"
91,"Thank you, Lauren"
92,"Let me just say that, clearly, in the first part of the quarter, several things happened"
93,One is the fact that the New Year build up into the 53rd week of 2016 and then we had the slowdown because the tax refunds were delayed
94,"By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, the business started to pick up again"
95,So we aren't really concerned
96,It's just a timing issue
97,"I'd just say globally, our business is looking good"
98,Let me quickly give you a snapshot of what we are seeing globally
99,Europe is doing very well
100,"The return to growth has been impressive, so we are feeling very good about Europe, across all parts of Europe"
101,"The Latin American continent, outside of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, is good, but Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are causes for concern"
102,"The Middle East is retooling itself, and we have to wait for it to figure out how they're going to come out of the oil price decline"
103,"China, the GDP growth is good"
104,"Our snacks and nutrition business is doing very well, and our beverage business is slowly recovering"
105,And India is coming out of a bold demonetization now to remonetization
106,"There's good GDP growth and we feel good about our business prospects there, too"
107,And as far as the U.S
108,"is concerned, as we head into the second quarter, we don't have a reason to be worried"
109,"Morning, Ali"
110,"You know, Ali, those are all very good questions, but every one of these concerns can also be reframed as an opportunity"
111,"And that's really what we do because if PepsiCo's business is over-developed in C-stores, we look at expanding in grocery and other channels, whether it's foodservice or vending, as a bigger opportunity"
112,And then we look to see how we can leverage our DSD system to grow our business into new categories in C-stores
113,And that's what has made us more valuable partners to convenience store retailers
114,"And in terms of difficulty with impulse on online, we've built a very good e-commerce business"
115,It's growing at impressive rates
116,"I don't want to discuss those rates, but it's growing at impressive rates"
117,"And clearly, our challenge is to create impulse online"
118,And we are working on tools with all of our partners to make our categories look like impulse categories online
119,"It's a work in process, but I must tell you that our growth rates are quite impressive"
120,"And in terms of health and wellness and impacting the snacks business, look, snacks are simple pleasures of life"
121,What we are doing is making our snacks more permissible
122,We're reducing the saturated fat levels
123,We remove trans fats
124,We're reducing the sodium levels
125,"If you're going to eat a snack, eat a PepsiCo snack"
126,And there's nothing wrong with eating a snack that's guilt-free
127,"So our goal is to offer you a range of options from sort of fun-for-you products to guilt-free products, which include Everyday Nutrition, both in a snacking form and in a food-like form"
128,"And at this point, we are singularly focused on growing the core, expanding out of the core but making sure across the board"
129,we make them a lot more permissible
130,And it looks like that strategy is working at this point
131,"Morning, Dara"
132,"Morning, Judy"
133,And we're already seeing the volume back
134,"Morning, Andrea"
135,"Morning, Laurent"
136,Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
137,LLC
138,"Good morning, Indra"
139,Question about Quaker
140,"I mean, despite Quaker being one of the LTS of all (34:54) PepsiCo brands, it seems the top line has been soft for quite some time, now including this quarter"
141,"At the same time, operating margin have reached a new high with 27.4% in the quarter"
142,So could you please give us more color on this business segment and is this first quarter kind of a reflection of what we should see for the entire year?
143,"Great question, Laurent"
144,I'd say the Quaker business internationally outside the United States is doing very well
145,"Solid growth, we are entering new markets"
146,"It's doing very, very well"
147,", the Quaker North America numbers that you see includes the Quaker hot cereal, which is where the Quaker brand is housed"
148,"And then all of the other businesses that go within Quaker North America, including Rice-A-Roni, Pasta Roni, Aunt Jemima, there's a whole bunch of other businesses, ready-to-eat cereals"
149,One-third of the business is the Quaker hot cereals
150,"And the Quaker hot cereals business, I'd say, over the past few years, has been flat to very slightly down"
151,And the only reason why the overall portfolio looks negative is because it's center store business in grocery stores
152,"And the overall center store category is down high single digits, sometimes even low double digits in some quarters"
153,"And so while we are outperforming the center store categories handsomely, I think our next challenge is how do we leverage our relationships with retailers to reinvent center store"
154,And that's a conversation we've been having with some of the retailers to say how can we help you rethink the center store so that we can bring growth back to that category
155,"And we need to do that in order to bring interest back to that whole cereal aisle and, therefore, Quaker"
156,"By itself, Quaker remains a much-loved brand and it's profitable"
157,"And our hope is that with the rejuvenation of center store, our categories grow, too"
158,"I think to talk about elasticity on a category basis is too general, Vivien"
159,I think we look at elasticity sub-segment by sub-segment
160,And all the pricing we've put in place in the U.S
161,is very carefully looking at the elasticity curves
162,"And we look to see what kind of pricing the consumer can adopt, what kind of volume impact it will have and what can we sustain as a portfolio"
163,And I think that what you're seeing right now is pricing that was sensible for the first quarter
164,"And as the year goes on, I mean, look, we put the pricing in place in Q1, or in fact, I'd say Q4 we started putting the pricing in place, and that's ticking through the year"
165,And we modify that as we go along if we believe that we need to change our promotional calendar to accommodate the consumer trends
166,"I don't know, Hugh, if you want to add anything"
167,"Hi, Robert"
168,"No change in tone of business, and"
169,I think consumer confidence continues to remain as positive as we've seen it
170,"Morning, Kevin"
171,"Thanks, Kevin"
172,"Look, at the end of the day, we oppose beverage taxes that are regressive and unfairly target one category or industry"
173,"I think, unfortunately, today's beverage taxes are more revenue generation-focused rather than health-focused"
174,"But whatever the reason be, from our perspective, we are working on two things: one, making our portfolio deliver products that are lower in sugar and a lot of zero sugar products and beverages with positive nutrition"
175,"So that's one part of our strategy, and we've been working on that for 10 years"
176,"The second part of our strategy, making sure we bolster the rest of the portfolio outside of beverages"
177,"So when taxes do come in, we can cushion the effect through managing the portfolio in a more intelligent way"
178,And that's been our strategy over the last decade because we anticipated some of these trends early on and we started to re-tool the company for that
179,"So at this point, let me just say that our strategy is crystal clear and we feel comfortable as to where we are headed"
180,So let me just close by thanking you all for your questions
181,"To summarize, we will continue to manage everything within our control to deliver attractive results in the short-term as we continue to position the business for long-term success"
182,"Thank you all for joining us this morning and, more importantly, thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment"
