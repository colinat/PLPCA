11,"As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business in a more disciplined, profitable manner with multi-unit customers"
12,We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multi-unit growth begin to build in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year
13,"While we do see customers' preference – consumers' preferences in restaurants continuing to include new, unique and customizable options that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity"
14,"These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multi-unit customers who provide value in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point"
15,"From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort including a reinvigoration of our portfolio that offers cleaner, fresher images for our branded products"
16,"These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points versus prior year"

29,HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years
30,We're excited to welcome them to Sysco family

44,"Our European business is facing some macroeconomic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the UK"
45,"Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation of about 9% during the first quarter"

57,"Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer"
58,"So, John, good morning"
59,It's Tom
60,What I would say is that we talked a lot over the last couple years about all the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area and that we felt good that they were going to help us both in deflationary and inflationary times
61,"And what I would just reiterate is that a lot of those tools – because what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted: meat, poultry, dairy"
62,"And so what they really allow us to do is effectively pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts over the short-term as well"
63,"So, it's really a matter of week-by-week providing our salespeople the right information, insight and guidance on how to basically price and be competitive in the marketplace"
64,"So, I assume – let's start with margin"
65,"When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin"
66,"And generally speaking, the margin – gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the U.S"
67,"But their cost structures tend to be a little higher as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin"
68,"A lot of the activity that we've started to share, they have their own kind of category management approach and program, but we're starting to share more information between the European team and the U.S"
69,team around how we might think about that process going forward
70,"So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs"
71,But I'd say the bigger areas are probably around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model here
72,"We've talked over the last couple of years about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio in our Sysco Brand, and those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learnings out of the U.S"
73,and share those best practices in Europe
74,And we've started that process already with that team
75,The only other thing
76,was fuel
77,And so where's (28:48) about a penny detriment on fuel versus prior year
78,"And the buildout, the cost comments that Joel made from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business and the impacts of the – some of the storms, we still are basically paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, et cetera, without any case activity during those times"
79,"And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense from an operating perspective as well"
80,"So, Ed, I assume you're talking about gross profit per case"
81,"So, it's a really good question given the inflationary environment we're experiencing"
82,"So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously, we haven't seen margin expansion during this time of inflation"
83,"So, we continue to feel good about that"
84,and that's a combination of things
85,It's the category management effort we've had going
86,"We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco Brand, another 82-basis-point improvement with our local customers, which is again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco Brand, and help them maintain their cost, while also delivering improved margins for us, is a kind of a win-win in there"
87,"And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly"
88,"And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multi-unit side, as we continue to go forward throughout the year"
89,Yeah
90,"I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is that obviously, we continue to see some inflation through at least the balance of the calendar year"
91,"There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California"
92,"So, there are going be some continued areas we're going to have to deal with"
93,"And again, as w talked – from the first question – I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this"
94,"But as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly and fairly aggressively is where we run into the biggest challenge and we just – always you (35:42) need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it, but I think we're doing a pretty good job"
95,"Hey, Vinnie"
96,"So, yeah, I would say it's relatively as we had expected and on plan"
97,"Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked"
98,The transformation efforts in the UK continue
99,"We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France"
100,"And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of"
101,"But there are some things we've not – need to get in place and operating the way we'd want, to get that type of growth in the future"
102,"The only other thing we already talked about with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have, the inflation there driven by the currency issues are significant"
103,"So, 9% inflation is a massive number"
104,And we are seeing impacts from that
105,"And we see that unfortunately, continuing for some period of time here"
106,"So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this that – that's different than what we had hoped or expected"
107,"Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts"
108,but it's sustained at fairly high levels for quite a while now
109,"Chris, from a Sysco Brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years and our total business is up 62 basis points and 82 basis points with our local customers"
110,"So, we continue to see opportunities there"
111,And we get asked this often is how high is – could it go?
112,And I don't think we really have a good view of that
113,And the reason I say that is what we continue to focus on is bringing very high quality products to the market at very competitive pricing
114,"And I think as our customers continue to feel different impacts whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases or other challenges they might feel in their business, product costs' always going be there"
115,And we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco Brand
116,"So, the other thing we've done – we've talked about is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco Brand to the market"
117,And I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers and that's why we see these increases
118,"So, I know that didn't answer you directly, but"
119,what I'd say is we continue to invest here
120,We feel good about it
121,I talked about this brand revitalization effort
122,"We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products"
123,"So, we – we're doing a lot of work in that area and it's – appears to be resonating nicely with our customers"
124,"Hey, Marisa"
125,I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to
126,I think we feel really good about the U.S
127,Broadline business
128,and we talk about it in context here of our U.S
129,Foodservice Operations segment
130,"And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well"
131,"So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter"
132,"So, I – the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin given all those circumstances, we feel actually very good about that business"
133,"Again, I'd say as we always talk, that's an average"
134,"So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time and that's where we leverage things like Sysco Brand"
135,"And, candidly, we share a lot of information with our customers, so this isn't about just us moving our pricing"
136,"We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories and why the costs are going up from suppliers the way they are"
137,"So, it's –"
138,we're pretty transparent in that area and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people so they can obviously educate our customers
139,"When you say non-restaurant customers, are you just talking about other segments within"
140,"I think that we continue – we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment that we operate in, our customer segments, and"
141,"our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments"
142,"As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the foodservice management and also in the retail foodservice"
143,"So, I think the other segments continue to grow"
144,Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us and we are performing well there also
145,"So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments"
146,"And I'd like to mention (45:47), other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers"
147,", we feel really good about where we are"
148,I think it's commentary not necessarily on fast food but on independent restaurants and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow
149,"And so, there are, obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers"
150,"And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market"
151,Yes
152,In many cases it was
153,(48:38)
154,"I would say, ex a couple of key geographies, right?"
155,"So whether it's here in the southeast where there are restaurants that are still closed or in parts of Florida like the Keys, where things are – many things are still closed"
156,Much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state
157,"So, I would say yes, in general"
158,"And, Andy, that was all based on case"
159,"All based on case volume, right"
160,We didn't project any impact on a rate basis from gross profit per case
161,We just looked at purely at cases
162,"And you asked about the 3%, we think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets"
163,I don't have anything really incremental to add
164,"I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts from – as you mentioned, from inflation and some of the macros in the UK"
165,"Let me – I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel embellish on kind of our broader strategy there"
166,The – let's start with the Mayca in Costa Rica
167,"So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with back in 2014."
168,We feel great about the partnership we've had with the folks at Mayca
169,"And as I shared, the results have been very positive over the last couple of years"
170,So we exercised our option to basically acquire that business completely recently
171,"And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously them doing a great job in their marketplace"
172,"Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition and a market within the U.S"
173,that's been white space for us
174,"Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint"
175,"We'd have no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a white space opportunity that we're very excited about"
176,"They're a terrific distributor with businesses on a lot of the islands, and are really excited about what we can do together in Hawaii"
177,"As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it and where you might see us focusing"
178,"Shane, did they accelerate?"
179,"So, I mean, when you think about this, we're – we break our U.S"
180,out into six markets
181,"And so, as you guys know, I mean, different things drive the business in different markets, not the least which is overall population growth, economic impact"
182,"So, what – as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the U.S"
183,"And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared regarding the impacts due to the hurricane in"
184,primarily what we call in our South and Southeast markets
185,"We continue to feel very good about the growth that we've had in the – both local, and as I mentioned, change in multi-unit"
186,And it is obviously both
187,We track both penetration which means more sales to existing customers as well as new lost business
188,"And I would say in each of those areas, they've continued to grow"
189,"In Foodservice and generally, new business is very important because there are a fair amount of customers each year that cycle for various reasons"
190,"And so, I'd – it's a pretty good balance actually of both though"
191,"And I'd say the thing for us that we've really tried to focus on is penetration because we believe that the more products and service that we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more – what we call maybe stickiness or loyalty from those customers"
192,You heard me talk in the past about loyalty
193,"and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement in the first quarter"
194,"So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers as far as what we're providing them"
195,"First of all, I think you articulated it actually pretty well"
196,"And so, I think that that's – it was good to hear that what we said is – was translated, I guess, by you in the right way"
197,"I think, there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about"
198,We do see it continuing to grow
199,But the other segment that we all know is growing
200,is this – kind of think about as prepared meals and this ability to get your – whatever your favorite restaurant is delivered to you now versus having to either go there to dine in or even to go pick it up
201,And we continue to see that movement happening
202,"And there are lots of different folks getting into that space now in these prepared foods that are both retail, but also in many cases in foodservice outlets that are handling that"
203,"And so I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy"
204,"And so, that's really – is what we were trying to refer to there"
205,Yes to your first part of your question and comment
206,"And as far as meal kits,"
207,"yeah, it's part of it"
208,"It's a fairly small segment and while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space right now"
209,"I think what we're seeing, though, is there are – think about it, instead of someone like a Blue Apron where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers or for consumers on a local level, whether that be an independent or a chain who are providing that same type of service"
