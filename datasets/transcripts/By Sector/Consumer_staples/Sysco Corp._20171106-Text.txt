Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone
Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives
While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year and ultimately deliver on our three-year operating income target
Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S
Foodservice Operations, sales grew 3.9% for the quarter, gross profit grew 3.8%, and gross margins remain flat
Adjusting for the hurricanes, gross profit dollar growth would have been approximately 4.3%
The growth in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the continued focus on category management including positive momentum from Sysco Brand and a balanced approach to pricing with our ongoing revenue management efforts
For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S
Broadline business remained strong at 2.8% and has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters
Adjusting for hurricanes, we believe that local case growth would have been over 3%
Our multi-unit customer segment declined, driving overall case growth to a modest 0.3%
As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business in a more disciplined, profitable manner with multi-unit customers
We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multi-unit growth begin to build in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year
While we do see customers' preference – consumers' preferences in restaurants continuing to include new, unique and customizable options that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity
These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multi-unit customers who provide value in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point
From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort including a reinvigoration of our portfolio that offers cleaner, fresher images for our branded products
These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points versus prior year
Regarding our supplier community, there were many examples during the recent storms where our supplier partners were there to support us and our customers who were in need
And I also want to share our thanks to all of those who supported us
Our digital ordering presence continues to grow and has now improved to approximately 40% of local cases ordered
This increased utilization is a result of our solid technology platform including improved product images and content, enhanced system capabilities, and increased levels of training
Also, as we centralized our support model for multi-unit accounts with tools such as order guide management, both Sysco and our customers have begun to see the benefits of working together to drive efficiencies in the business
Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 3.2%
While there were some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continue to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements
We are now implementing next evolution of tools to help streamline hours, improve delivery, and drive warehouse efficiencies
From an administrative cost perspective, we continue to focus on managing these expenses throughout the organization
Effectively managing overall cost structure remains a key priority for us, and we continue to focus on a variety of opportunities to deliver improvement
A key pillar of Sysco's strategy for growth and value creation is the continuous assessment of new market opportunities
As many of you know, we recently acquired HFM FoodService, a Hawaii-based broadline distributor with approximately $290 million in annual sales
HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years
We're excited to welcome them to Sysco family
Acquiring HFM provides Sysco with direct access to the growing Hawaiian market and is in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined, profitable growth of the business
We will report this business in our U.S
Foodservice segment going forward
Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter
With sales growing 6%, gross profit growing 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%
Driven by investments in our European supply chain transformation, transition costs associated with a new large customer in Mexico, and currency translation in Canada
Overall adjusted operating income declined by 8% for the quarter
Our business in Canada is off to a great start this year
We are experiencing local case growth in most regions, especially in major markets
We are also thoughtfully sharing and implementing strategic initiatives from our U.S
business, such as revenue management and other customer-centric solutions, including online ordering, to their business
These capabilities, along with a more focused approach to local customers, have translated into accelerated local case growth
Additionally, we are effectively managing our cost structure and improving supply chain efficiencies to help maintain a healthy gap between gross profit growth and expense growth to drive our overall performance
Our European business is facing some macroeconomic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the UK
Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation of about 9% during the first quarter
While we expect these headwinds in the UK to continue throughout our fiscal year, we are actively managing the business to mitigate these impacts
As for our business in Latin America, we are excited about the growth opportunities in this region, although there were some weakness due to the recent earthquakes in Mexico City and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico that I mentioned earlier
In Costa Rica, we continued to see solid growth as we continue expanding our Cash & Carry footprint
Additionally, subsequent to the close of our first quarter, we have completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Mayca business in Costa Rica
We will use cash to complete this transaction, and our debt levels will not be affected
We initially purchased 50% of the business in 2014, and we are very pleased with the performance thus far, as adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the past three years
We look forward to continued success with the Mayca team
Lastly, our SYGMA segment continues to grow
We are focused on implementing operational improvements that will contribute to long-term operating income improvement
In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory that we're on for fiscal 2018, to close out our three-year plan
Despite the severe weather-related challenges we faced in Q1, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customer's experience, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver the high end of our adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer
So, John, good morning
It's Tom
What I would say is that we talked a lot over the last couple years about all the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area and that we felt good that they were going to help us both in deflationary and inflationary times
And what I would just reiterate is that a lot of those tools – because what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted: meat, poultry, dairy
And so what they really allow us to do is effectively pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts over the short-term as well
So, it's really a matter of week-by-week providing our salespeople the right information, insight and guidance on how to basically price and be competitive in the marketplace
So, I assume – let's start with margin
When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin
And generally speaking, the margin – gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the U.S
But their cost structures tend to be a little higher as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin
A lot of the activity that we've started to share, they have their own kind of category management approach and program, but we're starting to share more information between the European team and the U.S
team around how we might think about that process going forward
So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs
But I'd say the bigger areas are probably around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model here
We've talked over the last couple of years about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio in our Sysco Brand, and those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learnings out of the U.S
and share those best practices in Europe
And we've started that process already with that team
The only other thing
was fuel
And so where's (28:48) about a penny detriment on fuel versus prior year
And the buildout, the cost comments that Joel made from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business and the impacts of the – some of the storms, we still are basically paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, et cetera, without any case activity during those times
And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense from an operating perspective as well
So, Ed, I assume you're talking about gross profit per case
So, it's a really good question given the inflationary environment we're experiencing
So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously, we haven't seen margin expansion during this time of inflation
So, we continue to feel good about that and that's a combination of things
It's the category management effort we've had going
We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco Brand, another 82-basis-point improvement with our local customers, which is again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco Brand, and help them maintain their cost, while also delivering improved margins for us, is a kind of a win-win in there
And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly
And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multi-unit side, as we continue to go forward throughout the year
Yeah
I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is that obviously, we continue to see some inflation through at least the balance of the calendar year
There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California
So, there are going be some continued areas we're going to have to deal with
And again, as w talked – from the first question – I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this
But as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly and fairly aggressively is where we run into the biggest challenge and we just – always you (35:42) need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it, but I think we're doing a pretty good job
Hey, Vinnie
So, yeah, I would say it's relatively as we had expected and on plan
Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked
The transformation efforts in the UK continue
We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France
And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of
But there are some things we've not – need to get in place and operating the way we'd want, to get that type of growth in the future
The only other thing we already talked about with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have, the inflation there driven by the currency issues are significant
So, 9% inflation is a massive number
And we are seeing impacts from that
And we see that unfortunately, continuing for some period of time here
So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this that – that's different than what we had hoped or expected
Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts but it's sustained at fairly high levels for quite a while now
Chris, from a Sysco Brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years and our total business is up 62 basis points and 82 basis points with our local customers
So, we continue to see opportunities there
And we get asked this often is how high is – could it go? And I don't think we really have a good view of that
And the reason I say that is what we continue to focus on is bringing very high quality products to the market at very competitive pricing
And I think as our customers continue to feel different impacts whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases or other challenges they might feel in their business, product costs' always going be there
And we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco Brand
So, the other thing we've done – we've talked about is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco Brand to the market
And I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers and that's why we see these increases
So, I know that didn't answer you directly, but what I'd say is we continue to invest here
We feel good about it
I talked about this brand revitalization effort
We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products
So, we – we're doing a lot of work in that area and it's – appears to be resonating nicely with our customers
Hey, Marisa
I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to
I think we feel really good about the U.S
Broadline business and we talk about it in context here of our U.S
Foodservice Operations segment
And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well
So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter
So, I – the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin given all those circumstances, we feel actually very good about that business
Again, I'd say as we always talk, that's an average
So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time and that's where we leverage things like Sysco Brand
And, candidly, we share a lot of information with our customers, so this isn't about just us moving our pricing
We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories and why the costs are going up from suppliers the way they are
So, it's – we're pretty transparent in that area and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people so they can obviously educate our customers
When you say non-restaurant customers, are you just talking about other segments within
I think that we continue – we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment that we operate in, our customer segments, and our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments
As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the foodservice management and also in the retail foodservice
So, I think the other segments continue to grow
Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us and we are performing well there also
So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments
And I'd like to mention (45:47), other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers, we feel really good about where we are
I think it's commentary not necessarily on fast food but on independent restaurants and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow
And so, there are, obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers
And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market
Yes
In many cases it was
(48:38)
I would say, ex a couple of key geographies, right? So whether it's here in the southeast where there are restaurants that are still closed or in parts of Florida like the Keys, where things are – many things are still closed
Much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state
So, I would say yes, in general
And, Andy, that was all based on case
All based on case volume, right
We didn't project any impact on a rate basis from gross profit per case
We just looked at purely at cases
And you asked about the 3%, we think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets
I don't have anything really incremental to add
I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts from – as you mentioned, from inflation and some of the macros in the UK
Let me – I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel embellish on kind of our broader strategy there
The – let's start with the Mayca in Costa Rica
So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with back in 2014. We feel great about the partnership we've had with the folks at Mayca
And as I shared, the results have been very positive over the last couple of years
So we exercised our option to basically acquire that business completely recently
And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously them doing a great job in their marketplace
Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition and a market within the U.S
that's been white space for us
Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint
We'd have no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a white space opportunity that we're very excited about
They're a terrific distributor with businesses on a lot of the islands, and are really excited about what we can do together in Hawaii
As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it and where you might see us focusing
Shane, did they accelerate? So, I mean, when you think about this, we're – we break our U.S
out into six markets
And so, as you guys know, I mean, different things drive the business in different markets, not the least which is overall population growth, economic impact
So, what – as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the U.S
And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared regarding the impacts due to the hurricane in primarily what we call in our South and Southeast markets
We continue to feel very good about the growth that we've had in the – both local, and as I mentioned, change in multi-unit
And it is obviously both
We track both penetration which means more sales to existing customers as well as new lost business
And I would say in each of those areas, they've continued to grow
In Foodservice and generally, new business is very important because there are a fair amount of customers each year that cycle for various reasons
And so, I'd – it's a pretty good balance actually of both though
And I'd say the thing for us that we've really tried to focus on is penetration because we believe that the more products and service that we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more – what we call maybe stickiness or loyalty from those customers
You heard me talk in the past about loyalty and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement in the first quarter
So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers as far as what we're providing them
First of all, I think you articulated it actually pretty well
And so, I think that that's – it was good to hear that what we said is – was translated, I guess, by you in the right way
I think, there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about
We do see it continuing to grow
But the other segment that we all know is growing is this – kind of think about as prepared meals and this ability to get your – whatever your favorite restaurant is delivered to you now versus having to either go there to dine in or even to go pick it up
And we continue to see that movement happening
And there are lots of different folks getting into that space now in these prepared foods that are both retail, but also in many cases in foodservice outlets that are handling that
And so I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy
And so, that's really – is what we were trying to refer to there
Yes to your first part of your question and comment
And as far as meal kits, yeah, it's part of it
It's a fairly small segment and while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space right now
I think what we're seeing, though, is there are – think about it, instead of someone like a Blue Apron where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers or for consumers on a local level, whether that be an independent or a chain who are providing that same type of service
