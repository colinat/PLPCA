The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
So with that said, we'll turn to our prepared remarks
I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment
Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and finally Benno will close with his perspective and then we'll open up the call for questions
So let me start with volume and sales
As our second quarter sales reflect, the continued investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing are driving strong volume and sales growth
Starting with volume, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of 8% growth, our highest gain in nearly 10 years, and with increases, importantly, in each of our four segments
Turning to sales, sales were up 5%, our highest growth in four years with increases in all of our U.S
segments
This sales growth reflects very strong volume on our base business in the U.S
in addition to price increases in certain international markets as well as about 2 points of growth from our acquisition last year of the Renew Life digestive health business
These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates
Excluding slightly less than 2 points of negative foreign currency, total company sales were up 6% versus the year-ago quarter
So simply put, we feel great about our top line results for the quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year
Our businesses are healthy and performing very well
Now turning to market share, our 13 week share in U.S
tracked channels increased 1/10th of a point versus the year-ago quarter with gains in four of our eight U.S
retail business units
This reflects our demand-building investments supporting recent innovation as well as our efforts to increase competitive activity in a number of categories, including Glad and Home Care
From a category standpoint, tracked channel data reflected a decline of about 2/10th of a point
However, our sales results in the quarter clearly indicate that tracked channel data does not capture the strong performance we're seeing in a number of untracked channels or businesses such as Home Care growth in the club channel, continued growth in our Professional Products business, strong results in the home hardware and pet specialty channels, growth with some untracked retailers that strongly support our Burt's Bees and Renew Life businesses and then finally, the momentum in online sales across our entire portfolio
Notably, there are some categories where e-commerce or online sales represent a top 10 or a top 5 channel with many of our businesses seeing very strong double-digit sales growth
So those are our results on a total company basis
Let me now turn to our segment results
Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume increased 10% and sales grew 3% behind higher shipments of Home Care products and Professional Products, partially offset by lower shipments of Laundry products
Volume outpaced sales growth as we secured incremental distribution in the club channel and invested more heavily in trade promotion
In Home Care, which is our largest U.S
business, sales increased high single digits
This gain was driven by disinfecting products, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes and sprays, and all-time record shipments of Clorox toilet bowl cleaners as we continued to invest behind the total Clorox brand equity
Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of market share gains
Looking to build on these results, we began shipping in December Clorox Scentiva, our new line of disinfecting sprays and wipes that also provides experiential fragrances
Initially we're offering two fragrances, Tuscan Lavender & Jasmine and Hawaiian Sunshine
While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial results of these new products
Moving on from Home Care, the Professional Products business delivered solid sales growth in the quarter
As in our Retail business, Clorox branded products are performing very well in the Professional Cleaning portion of the business
We're particularly excited about Clorox Fuzion, a new cleaner and disinfectant available to health care institutions which was launched in September
What makes Fuzion unique is that it kills microorganisms with minimal residue or odor, addressing a significant need in health care
Although Clorox Fuzion was just recently launched, it is running well ahead of expectations
Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased due to continuing softness in the sodium hypochlorite category
However, our focus remains on shifting consumption to higher-margin products such as Clorox Splash-Less Bleach, as well as investing behind our Clorox 2 color safe bleach
Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 11% volume growth and 12% sales growth
These results reflect the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May as well as higher sales in all of the other businesses in the segment: bags and wraps, charcoal and cat litter
So starting with bags and wraps, which is our Glad product line, we delivered sales growth driven by all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher-margin segment
And while market share in tracked channels for the bags and wraps category was down, due to a decrease in base trash bags, we continue to see growth in untracked channels with increases greater than 30% of Glad trash bags at some online retailers
Turning to charcoal, top line results were up double-digits
That said, we also recognized Q2 as a relatively small quarter for this business
So charcoal's impact to total company results in the quarter wasn't as large as at other times of the year
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are launching a new Kingsford Long-Burning Briquet, which will support the 2017 grilling season
In cat litter, sales increased behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched last calendar year
And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our third consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise
And lastly, results in the Household segment also reflect the Renew Life acquisition, which represented about half of the segment sales growth in the quarter
Importantly, we remain very excited about this acquisition as we continue to gain new distribution, while driving share growth and we have a solid innovation pipeline planned for the second half of fiscal year 2017. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%
I'll start with our Burt's Bees business, in which sales grew mid-single-digits on top of a double-digit increase in the year-ago quarter
Supported this year by innovation across our lip and face lines, such as strawberry lip balm and cleansing oil and strong sell-in on new offerings including glossy crayons, tinted lip oil, Flavor Crystals lip balm and eye makeup remover pads
Burt's Bees second quarter market share reached an all-time high, reflecting the innovation I just noted as well as the strong core business
Turning to our Food business, it also grew sales, driven by bottled Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and increased distribution of dry Hidden Valley products
Recent product innovations continue to perform well, including new flavors of our ranch with bottled salad dressing such as sriracha, cucumber, and cilantro lime, as well as our Hidden Valley Greek Yogurt dressing
Market shares continue to grow behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings
And further, we have a strong pipeline of innovation planned for the second half of the fiscal year including the launch of a preservative-free offering called Simply Ranch (12:02)
Turning to our Brita water-filtration business, sales were about flat in the quarter, but looking ahead, we will continue to invest in marketing, PR and innovation
And on the innovation front, in Q3 we will launch Brita Stream a Filter As You Pour system, making filtering water in a Brita pitcher 10 times faster
We also introduced the Brita Longlast Filter, long last filter, which filters 120 gallons of water so it lasts three times longer than a traditional 40 gallon filter and reduces even more contaminants, including 99% of lead
And then lastly, looking at our international business, volume increased 2% while sales decreased 2%
Excluding the 10-point impact we saw in the quarter from unfavorable foreign currency, sales grew 8%
Looking forward, we remain encouraged by our ability to execute price increases in key markets as well as our investments in Renew Life, particularly in Canada, Burt's Bees in Asia, e-commerce and innovation in our Laundry business across Latin America and in the Middle East
In addition, our Go Lean strategy in international, which we've spoken to you about during the last year or so, is now yielding results as evidenced in the higher margins for the quarter
We're very pleased on our progress here as this will enable us to offset continued foreign currency headwinds as well as provide funds to continue investing in higher growth international businesses
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date
And based on our year-to-date performance, as well as our updated outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, we now anticipate full year sales growth in a range of 3% to 4% versus our previous outlook of 2% to 4%
Although foreign currency remains a headwind, fundamentally our brands are healthy
We continue to support them with higher marketing support and we have more innovation across the portfolio coming in the second half
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook
I think, Joe, this is Steve Austenfeld, just building on Steve's comments
I would point to two things in that all other line that helped not be as dilutive as has been in recent quarters
One is that foreign currency wasn't as bad on a year-over-year basis as it had been previously, so that helped
And then secondly, the mix effect, which I think Steve talked about in response to an earlier question
Whereas we're still seeing some product mix related to some club volumes as we've discussed
We did have much more favorable business unit mix, mix across the franchise that helped us out there
And since you're looking at this gross margin reconciliation page and I appreciate you doing so and we've gotten a lot of questions on this
If you just fast-forward for a quarter or two and compare versus the second quarter, I think big picture – and there's always going to be movements across these different drivers, but for market movement, our prediction is it's going to start to be a little bit more dilutive, as we've said
We think commodities are probably going to rise after having certainly been a tailwind over the last year or so
But alternately, the manufacturing logistics line we think will become a bit more favorable
So gross margin may still be challenged for a little bit in Q3. Q4 may look a bit better, but that's the way I'd look at this table in terms of the major drivers on this, in terms of what may change going forward
Why don't we take a question from one last caller?
