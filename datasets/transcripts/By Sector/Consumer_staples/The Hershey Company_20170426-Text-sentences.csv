0,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast"
1,Hershey's first quarter results were solid and I'm pleased with our performance
2,"Net sales growth was 2.8%, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 2% sales growth, which we're happy with, given the choppy food industry retail trends in the U.S"
3,and the macroeconomic challenges in some international markets
4,"Gross margin was up nicely in Q1 and is expected to increase for the full year, fueling higher levels of advertising and other brand building initiatives"
5,"Adjusted EPS was $1.31, a strong start to the year and puts us in a position to deliver on our commitments"
6,The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is on track
7,This will not be a big benefit to our 2017 results
8,"However, this multiyear program should enable us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019 and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation"
9,"Preliminary analysis of Easter data indicates that we had a good season with sell-through in line with estimates, putting us in a position to gain share in this important season"
10,We believe this will result in total Hershey U.S
11,"candy, mint and gum, or CMG, April year-to-date retail takeaway of about 2.5%"
12,"While we don't like getting ahead of ourselves before results are final, given the timing of Easter, we thought this was an important metric to share"
13,"retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending April 8, 2017, in the xAOC+C-store channels declined 7.9%"
14,"As we stated on last quarter's conference call, first quarter net sales would be greater than retail takeaway due to Easter timing"
15,Recall that Easter occurred on April 16th in 2017 compared to March 27th in 2016.
16,"Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing, and therefore, noise in the data, is by looking at absolute market share results"
17,"In the first quarter, we gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity"
18,"In total, including the headwind from the year-ago seasonal activity, Hershey U.S"
19,CMG market share increased plus 0.4 points
20,"Our core power brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Ice Breakers, which had 2016 retail sales of $5 billion, continue to perform well"
21,"In the first quarter, combined non-seasonal retail takeaway on these brands increased 5.6%"
22,"Our Reese's NCAA basketball program and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, helped drive results"
23,"While we're pleased with our first quarter market share gains, non-seasonal CMG retail takeaway was softer than we anticipated, resulting in Q1 net sales coming in less than our plan"
24,"As you are all aware, Q1 marketplace performance across most of the U.S"
25,food group was soft
26,"While the perimeter continues to grow faster than center of the store, its growth rate also slowed"
27,Our analysis points to several factors contributing to the softness
28,"Some of them appeared to be Q1-specific, such as the tax refund delay while others are a continuation of the challenges like benefits inflation or channel shifting that we've been living with and we continue to solve for"
29,"Additionally, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels was about the same as the year-ago period, although dollars per trip were down"
30,Dollars per trip were better in March
31,"And as I mentioned earlier, preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with our estimates"
32,"We have a lot of variety, innovation and in-store programming over the remainder of the year as well as higher levels of advertising"
33,We think categories within the snack wheel will outpace center of the store products given the impulsivity and percentage of merchandising and display allocated to snacks
34,"As a result, we expect Hershey non-seasonal U.S"
35,CMG marketplace trends to improve
36,"However, given the uncertainty regarding overall U.S"
37,"brick-and-mortar retail trends, our updated full year U.S"
38,net sales growth rate is lower than our previous forecast
39,"Looking at some of our 2017 activity, it starts with Hershey's CLC, which has gotten off to a good start"
40,"In the first quarter, CLC net sales and marketplace results were in line with our estimates"
41,"Internally, we refer to CLC as a vertical launch, as our goal was to attain 80% distribution by early February"
42,We achieved this in eight weeks and had product available in all major channels to coincide with the beginning of TV and digital advertising
43,The take-home stand-up pouch is doing very well followed by the king-size pack-type
44,Sales by class of trade are tracking as expected
45,C-store results are particularly strong with retail sales two times that of any other channel
46,"While early, repeat purchases are tracking nicely"
47,Although retail sales trends did slow in April given the Easter period as there's not a seasonal pack-type or packaging for this product yet
48,With the launch of Reese's and Hershey's Cookies 'n'
49,"Crème Crunchers, we are looking to expand our power brands to capture broader snacking occasions"
50,Our research continues to show that snacking occasions have increased throughout the day
51,The modern snacking model indicates 90% of consumers snack multiple times throughout the day
52,"We expect that Crunchers will capture a portion of these snacking occasions as it combines powerful growing brands with sweet and crunchy textures to deliver a light, crisp eating experience"
53,"The take-home stand-up bag is currently available at a few select retailers, and the instant consumable tubes will be available by the end of June"
54,"We have a strong integrated Crunchers marketing plan to build awareness and trial, including a national FSI in Q3, in-store merchandising and display, as well as advertising"
55,I'm also excited about the late Q2 launch of Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup
56,The excitement of this launch started in February when the Reese's brand team started using social media to engage consumer with clues to a new chocolaty Cupspiracy
57,"The team posted various graphics and videos to hype the followers; and in March, announced the upcoming launch of the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup, a peanut butter cup infused with crunchy pieces from a chocolate cookie"
58,"This product, only available in an instant consumable pack-type, begins to ship in Q2."
59,And I think you'll find that the crunchy cookie bits are a complementary texture with the peanut butter that makes it a very satisfying experience
60,"Additionally, our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products continue to do well, and we're leveraging some other equities as well such as ALMOND JOY and TAKE5."
61,These items have enabled us to expand our breadth across the snack wheel and capture new usage occasions
62,That was just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America that we believe will grow our business over the remainder of the year
63,"We feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment and go-to-market capabilities will enable us to deliver our full year net sales objective"
64,"Snacks, which confectionery is a large part of, is performing better than many of the center of store categories, and we expect that to be the case going forward"
65,Investments in the CMG category in the form of advertising and innovation are present from most major manufacturers
66,"Therefore, given the high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points and solid margins, retailers continue to value the confectionery category"
67,"As a result, we would expect the category to continue to secure key merchandising and programming space"
68,"Now, for an update on our International and Other segment"
69,Net sales were essentially in line with our plan and on a constant currency basis up 4.2% versus the first quarter of 2016.
70,"I was particularly pleased with Mexico, Brazil, and India, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased a combined 15%"
71,"In Mexico, our chocolate retail takeaway increased solid double digits, although slightly less than the category growth of about 15%"
72,"Constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing"
73,"Sales were strong across all categories and brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates, Hershey's milk drink box, and Pelon Pelo Rico"
74,Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO and
75,Hershey's milk sticks are resonating with consumers and gaining traction
76,"In Brazil, while preliminary, we estimate that the chocolate category increased 7% to 8%"
77,"Our retail takeaway in Brazil was about two-and-a-half times the category growth rate, fueled by distribution gains on core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which were launched in the second half of 2016."
78,"As a result, in Q1, our market share in Brazil increased 0.6 points to about 4.5%"
79,Constant currency net sales in India increased about 16%
80,"Growth in the brands we're investing behind Hershey's branded syrup, spreads, and milk booster as well as Brookside, JOLLY RANCHER and SOFIT increased more than 50%"
81,"The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan"
82,"While small, this launch gives us exposure to a segment with above-average gross margin for the India business"
83,"Importantly, the transition of the portfolio is enabling a higher-margin business, which should put us in a position to invest and win in the marketplace with a sustainable operating model"
84,"As we end the second quarter in China, we'll begin to implement the Margin for Growth Program"
85,we discussed earlier this year
86,The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business
87,Patricia will discuss and review the impact of our impairment test of China's long-lived assets
88,"But the overall goal of this program is clear and will focus on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the company's supply chain and streamlining the operating model"
89,"China chocolate category sales in Q1 were about flat versus a year ago, and better than our estimate"
90,"This was similar to trends of other impulse products, which declined"
91,"Given the typical inventory levels we had post-Chinese New Year and the soft category in March, the temporary plant closure of about three weeks to four weeks due to an unscheduled inspection by regulators did not have a big impact on our business"
92,"Our chocolate business in China underperformed the market in the first quarter, with market share off one point"
93,"As we right-size our business and portfolio over the next year or two, we're looking to prioritize cities, classes of trade, brands, and innovation to satisfy the needs of this dynamic market"
94,"We're working closely with our local team, including our e-commerce group, which continues to show promise"
95,"Now to wrap up, I'm excited about our future, and I believe The Hershey Company has a long runway ahead of it"
96,"I'm supported by a great team of leaders, who have a lot of broad-based CPG experience"
97,"As we've shared with you on March 1st, we know what we need to do to succeed"
98,We are executing on our model to expand margins by reallocating resources to initiatives with a higher rate of return
99,We're investing in capabilities like go-to-market and building on our intellectual capital while also leveraging our core power brands and equipping our organization with the resources and tools to win in the marketplace
100,"These investments in growth and capabilities should put us in an advantage position to win with retailers and consumers, and ultimately, deliver on our financial commitments on our strategy of balanced top and bottom line growth and build shareholder value"
101,"I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results"
102,"Patricia, do you want to handle that one?"
103,Absolutely
104,"So as you know, we work closely with all of our retail customer partners"
105,And I think we mentioned last July that we were partnering with CVS on some of the work that they were doing around evolving their store layouts
106,And we partner with all of our retailers along those lines
107,"And March 1st, we mentioned a different customer we're also working with those efforts on"
108,I guess how I would tell you to think about
109,"it is, we service a broad range of retail customers"
110,They all have very different strategies
111,"And as some of our customer partners are making certain decisions on portfolio regarding store layout or front end, we have other of our customer partners who are actually looking to add incremental space behind confection, who are looking to take some other non-durable goods off the front end and put increased consumables and edibles; either overall at the front of store or as they have built their self checkouts and they hadn't yet built impulse around those"
112,So we feel good about the growth we're seeing in the marketplace in indulgent categories
113,"And if you look at the growth in categories, in indulgence and better-for-you, we're seeing growth across both and we have several customers who are really looking to leverage that growth"
114,"Good morning, David"
115,"Thanks, David"
116,"No, I would say two things"
117,"First of all, if you think about year-to-date, a large part of the acceleration of growth was driven by Easter"
118,"So, Easter is a big piece of what you see year-to-date"
119,"At the same time, we really look at the impact of the slowdown that we saw in the total box in Q1."
120,And we saw that have an impact on everyday
121,"So as we look at the balance of the year, we are looking for our everyday business to accelerate"
122,And we believe that that takes to make for the back half of the year is very achievable
123,We'll be looking at ensuring we have adequate investments
124,So we'll actually have some higher levels of spending in the back part of the year to drive that acceleration in the form of advertising
125,And we feel good about that
126,"But a lot of it is that Easter, the big boost in Easter"
127,and we really are looking and calling for an acceleration of everyday as we go into the back part of the year
128,"If you – without getting in too many specifics, if you think about that year-to-date performance, you would see seasonal items grew about double digits"
129,So think about that in that double-digit range
130,"And if you look at our non-seasonal core power brands, kind of the biggest five brands, they were up mid-single digits"
131,"So, obviously, there was a little bit of softness across some of the non-core piece of our portfolio"
132,But really double-digit growth on seasonal is what's a big component of 2.5%
133,"Yes, that's right"
134,"So in the first quarter, trade was down as we lapped some incremental trade merchandising that we had shared with you last year"
135,We made some big investments in incremental trade
136,"And as we have constantly worked to optimize our blend across trade and advertising, we made some different decisions this year"
137,"And yes, our advertising expense was closer to flat in Q1."
138,"And as we go out to the balance of the year, we'll see increases"
139,"Good morning, Andrew"
140,"So, we have continued to see some very strong growth on barkTHINS as we are still in the process of driving against expanding distribution and gaining trial amongst consumers on that franchise"
141,"So, I would say given the big piece of the growth curve that we're on, on that business; we've continued to see very strong growth there"
142,And I think we mentioned that it was a pretty significant piece of growth for us in Q1.
143,"And as I look at KRAVE, we're continuing to feel good about the momentum that we are seeing there"
144,So we've continued to gain share
145,We feel good about where velocities are
146,"Like any new brand, we're learning in terms of really optimizing how we make sure that we drive that hardest in the right – to the right consumers and into the right channels"
147,"So, in some cases, we overextended distribution, and we've right-sized that a bit"
148,But we continued to see very nice growth there
149,So – yeah
150,Our consumption and retail takeaway does not have to be at 2.5 points
151,"So we're actually planning for the takes to make there to be less than that, closer to slightly below 2 points"
152,"Yeah, exactly"
153,In line with the takes to make on that sales end
154,"And we anticipate that generally, our net sales and our takeaway are directionally pretty in line"
155,So you're right that we had a big benefit in shipments in Q4 behind Cookie Layer Crunch
156,"But as we look out to the back half of the year, across all the quarters, we think that we'll be relatively in line, plus or minus in that 0.5 point range"
157,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
158,LLC Got you
159,Okay
160,Thank you
161,Yeah
162,That's a great question
163,"I mean, obviously, we can't speak directly to pricing or any kind of foreshadowing around the pricing piece"
164,But I would say that we think about all of those as very viable levers and probably even more so today than we did in the past
165,"So I think you're right that price mix is something we aggressively have our teams focused on, which we can drive through,"
166,"focus on pack-types, focus on channels, build it into the innovation"
167,And I think perhaps that's a lever that we have not used as aggressively in the past
168,"We've spoken to you before about our whole focus on strategic revenue growth management and a lot of that as well is about really maximizing that net price realization by really, really scrutinizing all of the investments we make in trade and getting the value equation right on every pack-type and brand"
169,"So, we're putting more focus there than we have in the past"
170,"Well, I guess I'd say if I think about the first part of the year, I'd look and say Easter drove a lot of sales"
171,And there is some sourcing from Easter across the base portfolio
172,"So, I think it's hard to look just at the everyday business trends because there's interaction there with Easter"
173,"Certainly, I feel good about the fact that we have increased consumer investment as we go into the rest of the year, because we know that our category is very responsive"
174,"We continue to get very strong lift, and I feel really good that that combined with the very strong innovation that we have this year and customers are very excited about consumers are – are really going to help to drive consumers to the category and really boost the everyday business"
175,"So I would say, Pablo, we continue to see, if you at look category growth of various snack categories across the store that there is strong growth"
176,There's growth in indulgence
177,and there's also growth in health and wellness
178,So I don't know that I see a greater acceleration
179,We always start with the consumer in mind
180,And we are delighted to delight consumers with our indulgent portfolio
181,"At the same time, we've been a leader in choice and transparency, and we always want to provide options to consumers"
182,Now our Hershey's Kiss was one of the first forms of portion control at 25 calories for a Kiss
183,We led the smart labeling initiative in the industry
184,So we are just constantly evolving and updating our portfolio to help to meet consumer needs as best possible
185,Good morning
186,"Yes, it was"
187,It was consistent with the total box
188,"If you look at every category in the box, the trend was the same across the board"
189,"And as we mentioned in the comments, we think that there – I think everybody's been looking to say, okay,"
190,"what was that factor that really drove that across the board, and common thinking tends to be the tax refund delay had a big impact"
191,There were some lapping issues on a year-to-year basis
192,And then there's some continued pressures
193,But we feel good that we still see a rebound in March really
194,And we are focused on watching that very closely going forward
195,Yes
196,And dollars per trip were actually up in March after having been down
197,We have started to see that rebound and agree with that
198,Nothing that we saw there at all
199,Thanks for the question
200,"Yeah, we continue to feel really good with the programs that we have on the core brands"
201,"And so I think in terms of the continuing the growth on something like Reese's, it is continuing the news"
202,And some of our incremental investments in advertising towards the back part of the year will be made against those core brands to continue to leverage the momentum
203,"And then at the same time, we are absolutely focused on turning around and accelerating our growth trajectory on some of the other pieces of portfolio, namely on the non-chocolate sweets area"
204,So we will be increasing our investment there
205,"Although at the same time, we've right-sized those brands a bit"
206,"So as Mark mentioned, SKU rationalization, there are some areas where we have extended those brands and we had items in the marketplace that just weren't productive or profitable"
207,And so we made a decision to take the hit on pulling back on some of that
208,But we do have teams very focused on accelerating the growth there
209,And I think that's an opportunity for us going forward
210,I don't really think it's not as well-positioned
211,"I would say, I think that we have opportunities to just fix our execution on that piece of the portfolio"
212,There was a little bit more competition from smaller players last year where they went really aggressively on price
213,Some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin
214,So I really think it's more about what we do versus that there's any kind of consumer trend issue there
215,"So, let me start, and then I'll transfer it over to Patricia"
216,There is almost no – there is no shipment impact from that timing of Easter
217,"I mean, we shipped almost nothing in terms of Easter into the second quarter"
218,So that's not an issue at all
219,"And relative to the write-offs, we feel great about Malaysia"
220,So the write-offs that we talked about are not at all related to Malaysia
221,Okay
222,Yeah
223,We still feel good that we're in positive territory
224,"Yeah, the quarters always come in a little bit different depending on the promotion and innovation calendar"
225,But there's nothing that we'd be fallen off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter
226,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
227,LLC Got it
228,So as part of our Margin for Growth and
229,Margin Expansion Program
230,", we've started immediately in terms of taking the necessary steps to reset our investment in that marketplace and make some of the tough decisions"
231,"At the same time, the local teams have built very focused plans in terms of where we are focusing to grow and build a sustainable business model"
232,So we are focused on multiyear program
233,But beginning now to really focus on a couple of key provinces on our core portfolio and on a profitable mix of brands across the portfolio
234,"As you all know, the cost structure in some of the channels in China have changed and so we are shifting to more profitable channels and really try to capture some of the growth both in the second and third tier cities as well as e-commerce"
235,So it's a multi-year program that's underway now
236,and I'd say we can continue to update you as the year goes on
237,"I mean, I think for competitive purposes, we prefer not to go into all of the details"
238,"But we can give some thoughts to you, what we can share that might help you as you're building your model"
239,We see – we've done very well with online e-commerce in China
240,"As it's a big piece of the marketplace, it's been a nice growth driver for our business"
241,We've continued to see nice growth there
242,"and it is clearly amongst the channels,"
243,probably our number one area of focus from a channel perspective in that marketplace
244,So we have – we've built some infrastructure and that will continue to be a place that we'll want to invest in China going forward as in the U.S
