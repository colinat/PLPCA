0,"Having grown up in New England, I want to start by saying congratulation to the Super Bowl 51 Champion New England Patriots"
1,They set some records last night and we're setting some records ourselves here today
2,"On my first earnings call as President and CEO, I'm thrilled to share great results that Tyson Foods family delivered in the first quarter of fiscal year in 2017."
3,It's an incredibly exciting time at Tyson as we position ourselves for the next stage of growth
4,and I'm looking forward to leading our team as we seek to improve the value of our company for all of our stakeholders
5,"Let's talk about our Q1, which is the best quarter in the company's history with record earnings, operating income and cash flows"
6,Return on sales was in or above the normalized range for each of our segments and total company operating margin was a record 10.7%
7,"In the first quarter, we capitalized on favorable market conditions in our Beef and Pork segments and the cash generated is providing fuel for growth in our value-added Chicken and Prepared Foods segments"
8,"As we outlined in our year-end 2016 call, our earnings were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by $35 million in mark-to-market and lower cost-to-market accounting treatments"
9,This benefited our Q1 results as we started getting this back
10,"Synergies for the quarter were $161 million, with $40 million incremental to the Q1 of 2016."
11,Total synergies to-date are $620 million
12,And now for an update on our operating results which illustrates the advantage of our balanced portfolio with strong performances across the board
13,We'll start with Fresh Meats
14,"In the Beef segment, our operating income was a record $299 million, with a record operating margin of 8.5%"
15,"Volume was up 4.5%, while average price was down 6.6% reflecting the lower cut-out"
16,Plentiful cattle supplies and lower consumer pricing that stimulated both domestic and export demand contributed to the record results
17,"Our Beef business has been challenged in the past few weeks with typical seasonality, however with cattle supplies expected to increase 3% to 4%, the remainder of the year should be very strong"
18,"At this point, we're estimating Beef segments operating margin for the year to be around 5%"
19,"The Pork segments operating income for Q1 was a record $247 million, with a record 19.7% operating margin"
20,"Volume was up 4.3%, while average price was down 1%"
21,Demand was strong and especially in the export markets
22,"The USDA recently issued a report stating that China will likely remain a large importer of pork given its rising production costs, constraints on land use, and stricter environmental regulations"
23,"While Tyson Foods doesn't export a significant amount of pork to China, other U.S"
24,"packers do, which creates domestic disappearance"
25,"We're certainly aware of the additional capacity coming online, but there appears to be enough hog production to support these plants, and continuing export demand should absorb the additional supply"
26,"At this point, we don't know how any changes in the U.S"
27,"trade policy might affect exports of pork or other proteins, but in general, trade restrictions that impact export demand also can affect domestic supply"
28,We're planning for different scenarios and will be prepared to adapt if there's any change in policy
29,Now turning to our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments
30,"In our Chicken segment, our first quarter operating income was $263 million, with a 9.7% operating margin"
31,Average price was up 1.4% and volume was up 1.3%
32,"Value-added volume was up 5%, while commodity volume declined, demonstrating that we're growing where we want to grow with products carrying higher, more stable margins"
33,Sales price was up due to these mixed changes offsetting general market declines
34,Costs increased in part due to additional mass spending to support growth in the Tyson brand
35,We expect more pricing pressure from competing proteins for chicken while our feed costs are projected to be flat with last year
36,"With our predominantly value-added mix, the Chicken segment should be in the upper end of its normalized range of 9% to 11% return on sales for the year"
37,"In our Prepared Foods segment, operating income in the first quarter was $190 million with a 10% operating margin"
38,"Average price was down 2.9%, reflecting lower raw material costs passed through to customers, volume increased to 2.9% offsetting lower pricing"
39,"Synergies within the Prepared Foods segment were $127 million for the quarter, with $32 million incremental to Q1 of 2016."
40,"As a reminder, not all of the synergies flow to the bottom line as we invest in the long-term health of the business"
41,"For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect flat input costs, but we also expect a more competitive pricing environment given overall protein availability"
42,"Something very important to me, in seeing our company along its path to achieving its fullest growth potential is investing in our facilities to support that growth"
43,"As such, I want to make you aware of an important investment initiative we've undertaken that will affect the Prepared Foods segment for approximately 18 months"
44,"Within Prepared Foods, we have two well-developed businesses in both retail and food service channels"
45,These channels are complementary in reaching all consumers
46,Our scale in both channels provides a natural volume hedge as consumer eating behavior shifts between channels
47,This leadership position is increasingly critical as channels blur chasing rapidly growing convenience and on-the-go occasions as exemplified by the rise of e-commerce meal kits
48,Our retail channel consists of primarily category-defining branded products and is propelled by industry-leading marketing capabilities as well as a well-supported asset base
49,It has gross margins as robust as any in the industry and growth rates that lead the industry
50,The food service channel is also characterized by industry-leading share positions across more than 10 categories
51,"In contrast to retail, in food service, we play in primarily unbranded price-driven categories that are highly competitive and can be volatile as they absorb swings in commodity"
52,"These category and channel positions are strategically important for long-term growth, but generally operate at margins below those realized by our retail brands"
53,Network investments to upgrade capacity and throughput for long-term growth have increased the cost structure in our plants that serve the food service channel and further pressured margins
54,"As the capacity investments translate into improved efficiency and volume growth over the next 18 months, these pressures will abate, but in the interim they will continue to compress margins possibly dropping the segment below 10% return on sales for the year and around 9% for the second quarter"
55,Let's now turn to a view on total company growth
56,Our sales volume across all segments rolled up to 2.4% growth
57,Our retail channel showed the most volume growth in the company versus Q1 last year with a 6.6% increase
58,"IRI data for the 13-week period corresponding with our Q1 showed Tyson Foods, both Core 9 and all Tyson products sold at retail, were leading sales volume and sales dollar growth among retail food manufacturers"
59,"As you'll see in the slides posted on our website this morning, we were only â€“ we were, of the top 10 branded food-only companies, the only one with positive sales volume and one of only two companies with positive sales dollar growth"
60,"For the most recent 13-week period, IRI reported total Tyson retail volume was up 6%"
61,Core 9 volume was also up 6% with 1.2 points of share gain
62,"Despite the deflationary pricing environment, dollar sales were up 2% for total Tyson and 3% in the Core 9."
63,"Our retail branded business experienced continued strong growth in the quarter behind base business momentum, excellent retail execution around the holidays and new product launches"
64,"The Hillshire Farm brand drove growth across smoked sausage, lunchmeat and cocktail links categories"
65,"Jimmy Dean's Stuffed Hash Browns, Jimmy Dean Delights Frittatas, Hillshire Snacking, and Tyson Premium Select Nuggets are examples of innovations that are meeting or exceeding our expectations"
66,We continued improving ROI on our advertising spend behind new campaigns utilizing more precise media buying and effective advertising execution
67,"I should note, we're about to start lapping some more difficult comparisons in the next few months, our growth however should still outpace the industry"
68,"In our food service channel, Q1 volume was flat to slightly up in an environment of three consecutive quarters of declining food service traffic as consumers moved towards retail channels"
69,Our segmentation strategy and advantaged customer positions mean a large share of our volume is in accounts where their sales are outperforming industry traffic trends
70,This can be seen in the performance of some critical food service categories and will set us up well for long-term growth
71,"On our Q4 call, we introduced new analytics to give you some insight into our broad line distribution portion of our food service channel, which serves predominantly local and regional food service operators"
72,"These analytics, based on NPD Supply Track data follow five critical broad line categories prioritized for growth"
73,"These categories are value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, bacon and pizza toppings"
74,"Like our Core 9 or retail, these are key indicators of the overall health of our protein businesses within food service distribution"
75,"Our Focus 5 categories grew volumes 12% in October, the most recent data available"
76,"With more work to do, we are pleased with our progress in the Focus 5."
77,"In our earnings call in November, we talked about the investments we're making in innovation, consumer insights and brands"
78,"At our CAGNY Presentation on February 21, we'll do a deep dive on those efforts and share with you examples of our innovation pipeline"
79,The opportunities we see for long-term growth and how we're inventing new solutions to meet the evolving needs of consumers and customers are exciting
80,"Another investment we have made for the long-term health of our company is in our people, and I want to provide some insight on what this means and the scope"
81,"As a part of the integration of Hillshire brands, we standardized the holiday and vacation policies across the company and transitioned to a singular competitive compensation structure"
82,This incremental expense of $58 million in Q1 impacted Chicken by $23 million and Prepared Foods by $22 million
83,The investment is front-loaded in our fiscal year with a lesser impact later in the year and was not adjusted out of our reported earnings
84,"While it is a significant amount of money, it's imperative to invest in our team members for long-term growth and stability"
85,We want to keep Tyson Foods as a preferred place to work with a compensation package that attracts and retains the best people in the industry
86,"We're investing where it matters, while heightening our focus on lean and continuous improvement to provide fuel for these investments"
87,We are becoming more disciplined at driving out non-value-added costs across the company to focus our precious resources on growth
88,There will be significant dollars attached to those cost savings
89,and I plan to be more descriptive about this in the future
90,"So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis to walk you through our financial results"
91,Good morning
92,"Let me talk about growth overall, then we can talk about sort of EPS over time"
93,"You know, yes, we are going to â€“ we will be making investments for the future of the company in terms of growth, but we are also going to deliver growth in 2017."
94,"So, you know, it's key"
95,", it's our quarter (21:13) â€“ our fiber, it's our story"
96,We are consistent
97,We want sustainable growth
98,That's our objective
99,And I'll say a few things
100,"One, you know, we continue to invest where we want to grow and we're demonstrating growth on value-added products versus the commodity elements of our portfolio, and"
101,I'd say that's particularly in Chicken and Prepared Foods
102,we see that very prominently
103,"Beef and Pork are also benefiting from livestock supply and very strong markets, but I would say, Chicken and Prepared Foods is where you'll find us investing heavily"
104,Prepared Foods is in a fantastic position to take advantage of innovation and brand strength
105,"We've seen the results of the innovation coming through volume, and we are prepared at CAGNY to show you some pretty fantastic progress we've made on our innovation pipeline"
106,"So as it relates to, Heather, the EPS growth expectations, you know, the range that we're guiding to now puts us in the 12% to 15% for this year"
107,"Ongoing, that's, you know, where we've talked about continuing to guide as a high single digits EPS growth, and you know, I'll turn it over to Dennis for anything else you want to add there"
108,Correct
109,"Without giving you specific guidance for 2018, I mean that's too far away for us"
110,", what I'd say is we're making the right investments for growth"
111,"If you think about the Prepared Foods business, it's really, like I said, two separate businesses"
112,"Predominantly in the legacy Tyson organization, it was a food service business and in the legacy Hillshire business, it was about 75% retail, 25% food service"
113,The margin profiles are very different in those businesses
114,The assets were in different condition
115,"And, so going forward, we want the mix to turn out to be as profitable growth â€“ continuing profitable growth within the 10% to 12% range"
116,"However, we have some work to do as it relates to supporting those assets that serve the food service business"
117,"Growth, we feel really strong about in the long-term, and like I said, we'll talk more about that at CAGNY"
118,"Ken, if we deliver low double-digits, that's going to be awesome"
119,"But we're focused on high single-digits, because for us, we believe to continue the growth algorithm of this company, we have to invest"
120,We're going to simultaneously invest
121,We're going to also amp up our continuous improvement program as I talked about
122,"That feels like the right place for us to continue to drive growth, Dennis"
123,"Yeah, no, I got it, great question"
124,"We're constantly paranoid about avian influenza, because it's certainly is something that can wreak havoc on our company"
125,"What I'd say is, 2015, we amped up our bio-security"
126,"We had good bio-security to begin with, but we amped it up to an all-time high level of discipline and scrutiny, frankly, and it hasn't stopped"
127,"And so, that we feel confident about our position, and right now it appears to be, as you called out, a non-U.S"
128,"issue, but certainly we remain diligent in our efforts to make sure Tyson is protected"
129,"Yeah, really it's too small an issue at this point"
130,"Yeah, you're welcome"
131,Good morning
132,Agreed
133,"Yeah, so, Jeremy, as we talked about synergies, the one thing we need to come back to is those numbers that we have continue to talk about, those are gross numbers and there's a lot of expenses beneath that that, you know, net out to a smaller number, and there's a significant amount of investment that we are making in the cost base for sure"
134,"The way I'd have you think about it is that, yes, predominantly those have gone to make it more attractive margin in the business, but that's something that will continue on"
135,"So as we stop the sort of synergy discussion, we're going to continue to talk about lean and continuous improvement, that's going to, you know, provide the fuel for growth for the business"
136,"Over time, we expect margin expansion"
137,We talked about 10% being the number that we're comfortable with right now
138,But you should expect margin to expand toward the higher end of that range and continue to experience greater than industry growth
139,Yeah
140,"It will be, you know, our guidance is in that upper-end of the normalized range, 9% to 11%"
141,"We expect it to be growing in both, you know, Frozen and Fresh segments"
142,"What I'd say is, you know, we're taking advantage of the low cost of raw materials right now"
143,"and we've added cooking capacity, which is"
144,"â€“ we don't talk about that a lot, but that is something that we have made tremendous progress on, as we've added capacity, we've sold that capacity"
145,"and so we're in a position where we're, you know, looking to add more capacity"
146,So the mix is improving
147,"We're focused on reducing the cost structure as you call out, but we continue to see that we're doing the right things in that business, and outside of a massive grain shock, we feel like we're in a great, great position"
148,"Yeah, sure"
149,"You know, pricing is competitive"
150,"There's a lot of protein available, so pricing is a big effect, Adam"
151,"And, you know, that's not going to abate in the near term, and we see that being an issue that's hanging with us"
152,"We also see, as we've discussed, some of those costs rolling through"
153,"Now, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's mostly the one-time nature that has rolled through, but that is something that we are investing in to make sure that the margin holds up over time"
154,But I'd say the biggest thing that we're facing right now is just pricing as it relates to overall availability
155,Yeah
156,Q2 is always a tough quarter for us to understand exactly how it's going to play out given the seasonality of our business
157,But I would say it's not just on the Fresh Meat side that there's tremendous seasonality as it relates to the poultry and Prepared Foods side as well
158,So we feel like Q2 will be challenged and
159,we think Q3 and Q4 will be strong
160,"Now, we're guiding to what we believe, based on what we know today, those are the numbers we feel confident about"
161,"and we'll see how it plays out, but"
162,it's a lot depends on how Q2 rolls
163,After
164,You're welcome
165,"Yeah, I'm going to â€“ I'll tackle the first one, and Dennis could probably provide some color on the second part of that, Rob"
166,"You know, the difference between last year and this year is just the pricing for us that we're into the marketplace with"
167,"I mean, it's what we're focused on as we talked repeatedly is about making sure that we're continuing to put ourselves in a position where we're growing volume"
168,"So, think about that value-added growth of 5% that comes making sure that we're entirely competitive, so that is the reason why, year over-year, you're not seeing the same margin structure, but you're seeing the maintained growth"
169,"Dennis, do you want to comment on that?"
170,Absolutely
171,"Yeah, pricing pressure, think about Prepared Foods, our portfolio, it is predominantly protein and it plays in the same space, same dynamics, so absolutely we have been more aggressive for sure"
172,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
173,LLC
174,Okay
175,You're welcome
176,"Sure, Akshay"
177,The way to think about it is we have to come to one system across Tyson Foods which is not a unusual thing for companies to make sure that they're doing that in a thoughtful way
178,"As we did it, we said that the right thing to do was to get to a point where we have compelling packages for our team across the organization"
179,"For the year, we expect it's going to be about $100 million in total charges"
180,"The $58 million that hit Q1, I spoke about, about 80% of that is one-time in nature, and the costs for the rest of the year"
181,", they flow through"
182,But I would say that the recurring cost structure increase is less than the accounting true-up for the first quarter
183,and it does make a lot of sense for us to focus on making sure that we have a one-Tyson system as it relates to compensation
184,"No, it was getting to one system on holidays and vacations and because we were so different across both"
185,", that was the key issue"
186,"Yeah, and I think it's fair to say that the business has always been on the, as you call it, on the legacy Tyson side, it's been a challenging business from a margin perspective"
187,"If we look at the 2014 results, it was a loss maker"
188,"2013, it was about 3%"
189,"I think the 5.5 % was one-time that was, I believe, 2012."
190,"But if you look at the business year-over-year for the legacy Tyson team, it was a business that was challenged from a margin perspective"
191,"So when you're flowing through with the addition of Hillshire, there are some â€“ the blend-out is going to be somewhat less"
192,"As it relates to your question about the investing in the business, yes, we have continued to invest and part of that"
193,"or I would say the majority of that, as it relates to synergies, have been closing some plants that were non-strategic as we consolidated volume into existing plants that we're heavily investing in"
194,That sometimes goes really well
195,Sometimes it wasn't executed exactly as we had drawn up on the white board
196,"However, what I would say is, the investments that we're making now are pointed towards growing the business and improving the margins"
197,"And so, that's as clear as I could put it, Akshay"
198,Yeah
199,"So the â€“ we're just getting the number, the percentage of the top of my head, I don't know what that is"
200,"You can maybe follow-up with that, Jon, to the extent that we're going to share it"
201,"What I would say is, we are making tremendous impact on our business in food service on poultry"
202,"So our Prepared or further processed business in poultry is going extremely well in food service, and we are making sure that those categories we want to play long-term are going to be healthy"
203,"Now, where that growth is going to be sourced from, there's a lot of channel shifting as I talked about"
204,"But if you think about the periphery of the grocery store, our customers are looking for solutions that are not necessarily retail packaged brands, but they are ready to consume"
205,You might have heard this term gross around
206,"There's a lot of â€“ our customers that are looking to capture food service volume, we are in the sweet spot of that space, because our solutions are exactly what they're looking for and our expertise is what they want to leverage"
207,"So, I'll say, and thinking growth for the future, food service will come from the traditional channels that it does, that you know of, but I also would ask you to think about that periphery of the store being a real sweet spot for us"
208,Good morning
209,"Yes, yes, it is"
210,"That is going to be a part of what's going to continue to hang with us here, but we wanted to make an improvement in our network"
211,We went down that path
212,"We made a good decision to close a plant that was not fit for the business, but the production was transferred to the newer facilities"
213,"It was absolutely the right decision to position us for growth, and we just have more work to do"
214,"The transition wasn't seamless, like I said, but we feel like that we're on path to make that a long-term healthy strong business for us, both in terms of Prepared Foods growth and also the margin structure"
215,"Yeah, so Farha, I won't give you the forward-looking marketing investments, but what I will tell you is we are doing two things that you should hold us accountable to"
216,One is making sure that that investment continues to improve its return
217,So we are doing some fabulous work on our team to make sure ROI continues to go up on marketing investments
218,"And so if the ROI is increasing and we're making the right moves in supporting our branded businesses, we would expect the overall to continue to go up"
219,"So, if we're getting a good return on that, we want to support the brands, and you know, it depends on which brand you're talking about, what the ultimate level is, the mix-out is going to be different depending upon what kind of traction we've got"
220,"Clearly, we're going to spending and have spent a lot more on the Tyson brands"
221,and we're going to continue to spend on the other brands that we have the number one position
222,"So it's what's required, certainly our customers expect that"
223,"And like I said, we're going to get nice returns on those investments"
224,Okay
225,Let me take that as a follow-up
226,We'll talk to Jon to see if we can get you some more detail around that that we're willing to share
227,And I mean part of it
228,we feel like we have a competitive advantage in that area and want to make sure we thread that needle correctly
229,"But I would ask Jon to follow up with you, Farah"
230,"Yeah, awesome"
231,"So, you know, I really thought we'd be going out of limb talking about 2018."
232,"What we see are, you know, certainly in the regions where we are â€“"
233,we'd like how it's shaping up
234,"2017 looks to have better numbers, let's say, cattle in our regions, which is great"
235,"Our cattle inventory, we feel like â€“ if you look at it compared to 2011 and 2012, this year, it's similar â€“"
236,its improving to that level
237,"And, you know, we feel like for our position going into 2018, it's teeing up well, but it's just too far out there to know"
238,"You know, 2018 cattle are born in 2016, and we're kind of, you know, trying to model that ourselves"
239,But we feel great about 2018.
240,"I can't give you a view, I'm sorry"
241,"I'll just go back and say, 2017 looks better than last year, and the Midwest, more cattle coming"
242,We like that
243,"We believed for the year we're at 5%, just the level that we're feeling"
244,like we'll wind up at
245,"And it's hard to tell, but I would say, we're shaping up well"
246,You're welcome
247,No
248,"So, as I've said before, the Georgia Dock for Tyson Foods is a tempest in a teapot"
249,It's really not something that drives a lot of our attention
250,"Since the elimination of the mechanism last month, customers that are affected are being switched to other methods, so no impact on margin"
251,We've told you that in the past we have various pricing mechanisms
252,"It's really supply and demand that our customers are looking at, what's the overall protein availability"
253,", how do they feel like they have leverage"
254,"Certainly, as we're continuing to grow the branded business more of that is on a list price"
255,"We have certainly some businesses that are formula driven, but predominantly on grains, so that's what I'd ask you to think about"
256,"And the diversity of those pricing mechanisms for us tells us it's important for us, because it helps us de-risk"
257,the total margin profile
258,"But as it relates to the Georgia Dock, no impact"
259,You're welcome
260,"Absolutely, we will continue to flex our buy versus grow strategy"
261,We try to grow whole-bird increments to remind everybody
262,and we buy pieces
263,"So the parts that we need we're going to continue to buy on the market when the market is favorable, but that's our model"
264,And that's what we feel really strong about to continue our growth is to make sure that we're making sure what we're producing internally is in whole-bird increments
265,"About 80% of the $58 million, so let's just round it up to about $50 million"
266,"Ken, the 2017, whatever we have teed up to invest in 2017 is in our guidance"
267,", it's in the capital plan"
268,"This is, you know, we've been working on this for some time"
269,"As it relates to rolling forward beyond 2017, simultaneously, we're amping up our continuous improvement program"
270,"So investments that we're going to make in the business, we know that there needs to be a paid for (51:24)"
271,"So that is what we intend to do, so it's not going to be incremental"
272,I would ask you to think about it as it's going to be offset by continued improvement in our continuous improvement efforts and discipline
273,So that's how I think about it
274,I will have Jon follow-up with you
275,We can do the math together and
276,2017 is continuing to be a number where â€“ we are going to grow in 2017
277,"and we believe that, of course, it's going to be a base for us to grow into the future"
278,"But, you know, that's not â€“ we want to make sure that we are continuing to grow while we're investing"
279,", that's a trick, and that's what we want to do for, you know, all of our stakeholders, make sure we're doing that really, really well"
280,Absolutely
281,"Yeah, I'd say, Heather, it's not the cuts so much as it is the businesses that, I'd say, apply to"
282,"So if you think about the retail business, it operates in a typical CPG model, where we are looking at supply/demand, the strength of the brands, elasticities to make the right calls on what's the best thing for us to do as it relates to pricing"
