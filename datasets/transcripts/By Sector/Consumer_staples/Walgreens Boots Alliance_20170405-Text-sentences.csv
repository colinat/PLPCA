1,Our performance this quarter was in line with our expectations despite challenging conditions in a number of our markets
2,We were particularly pleased with growth in U.S
3,pharmacy volume and market share as the early benefits of our new pharmacy contracts started to come through
4,We continue to work hard to secure regulatory clearance for the Rite Aid transaction and we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2017.
5,So now let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter
6,"As we expected, currency again had a negative impact, the U.S"
7,dollar being around 16% higher versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year
8,Sales for the quarter were $29.4 billion down 2.4% versus the comparable quarter
9,"On a constant currency basis, sales were up 0.9%"
10,"Without the extra day in February last year, this would have been up 2.2%"
11,"GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 20.5%"
12,GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion up 14% and diluted EPS was $0.98 up 15.3%
13,Adjusted operating income was $2 billion down 4.9% and constant currency was down 2.7%
14,We estimate this would have been broadly flat taking into account the leap year impact
15,"Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.5 billion, up 3.7% and in constant currency up 6.2%"
16,Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.36 up 3.8% and in constant currency up 6.1%
17,The adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen was 23.7%
18,"This was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to reduced estimated annual tax rate associated with our current year pretax earnings, an incremental discrete tax benefits"
19,Year-to-date the tax rate on the same basis was 24.5%
20,"For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2017."
21,I will not go through this in great detail
22,but you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share
23,was $1.94 up 3.7% versus the same period a year ago
24,Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $2.46 up 5.1% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis
25,So let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA
26,"Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $21.8 billion, up 1.5% over the year ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 2.4%"
27,"As 2016 was the leap year, when we calculate comparable sales and prescription figures, we exclude the 29 February, 2016."
28,Adjusted gross profit was $5.9 billion down 0.6% over the year ago quarter with the impact of the extra day in 2016 holding back growth and adjusted gross profit by over 1%
29,Lower retail gross profit was partially offset by an increase in pharmacy
30,"Adjusted SG&A was 20% of sales, an improvement of 0.1 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter"
31,Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was improved versus comparable quarters for 15 consecutive quarters
32,"As a result of the lower adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin was down 0.5 percentage points of 7.1% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion down 4.9%"
33,So now let's look in more detail at Pharmacy
34,U.S
35,Pharmacy total sales were up 3.7% mainly driven by increased retail script volume
36,"We filled 246.7 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 5.9%"
37,"On a comparable basis for stores which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 4.2% with scripts filled up 7.9%"
38,This was the highest quarterly growth rate in more than seven years and was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and strategic pharmacy partnerships which we announced last year
39,We are pleased both with the progress of Medicare Part D an early indications of the benefits derived from our new pharmacy contracts
40,Within sales volume growth and brand inflation was partially offset by reimbursement pressure which was in line with what we had anticipated and by the impact of generics
41,"Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.4%, up approximately 100 basis points over the year ago quarter"
42,Total retail sales were down 2.7% on the same quarter last year
43,This includes the impact of previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations and the impact of the leap day in the prior year
44,Comparable retail sales were down 0.8% in the quarter and what was a challenging environment
45,The claims in the consumables and general merchandize and personal care categories partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness and beauty categories
46,Adjusted gross profit was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to the decline in sales
47,"Despite the difficult market conditions, we were pleased with growth in our key categories"
48,"This was reflected by our absolute performance, as well as recent market share gains"
49,"Based on the latest Nielsen data for the 13 weeks ended 25 February, we gain share in the health and wellness, beauty and personal care categories"
50,"However, we know there is more to do and after taking further actions to help drive future performance"
51,"These include simplifying our product offering, further emphasis on our omni-channel capabilities, and expansion of our beauty differentiation program"
52,"While still early in the journey, our own brands are performing well and currently represent over 15% beauty sales in our beauty differentiation stores"
53,We have now recruited beauty advisors across more than 1800 stores which is helping to drive No7 sales and gross profit
54,Repurchase levels of No7 products are been very encouraging and Soap & Glory has also got off to a good start
55,"Following the successful introduction of No7 and Soap & Glory, we are planning to introduce another of our own brands Botanics, into our existing beauty differentiation stores in the next six months"
56,"Looking ahead we are now developing plans to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar year"
57,"So next, let's look at the progress of our cost transformation program"
58,"In our previously announced cost transformation program, we set ourselves an ambitious target of delivering $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017."
59,I'm delighted to announce that we achieved this target ahead of plan
60,We now expect that the cumulative pretax charges associated with this program will be approximately $1.8 billion
61,This is in line with our expectations with an expanded program was announced in April 2015.
62,These costs are higher than we anticipated in October primarily as we now expect to close around 60 more stores
63,The program will be completed as expected by the end of fiscal 2017 and the full benefits will be realized in future periods
64,"We continue to expect but approximately 60% of the program costs will be in cash over time, the principle items being future lease obligations"
65,So now let's look at the results of the retail pharmacy international division
66,"Sales for the division were $3.1 billion, down 1.9% in constant currency again impacted by the leap year"
67,Comparable store sales decreased 0.9% in constant currency
68,Comparable pharmacy sales were down 3.7% on a constant currency basis due to decline in the U.K
69,which is partially offset by growth in other markets
70,comparable pharmacy sales were down 5.2% mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding
71,Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.6% reflecting Boots growth in the U.K
72,", Republic of Ireland, and Thailand"
73,Within the U.K
74,Boots comparable retail sales increased 0.7% versus the year ago quarter supported by solid December trading
75,Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 4% in constant currency to $1.2 billion mainly due to lower pharmacy margins in the U.K
76,reflecting the reduction in funding and the impact of the leap year - leap day in the prior year
77,Adjusted SG&A in constant currency dollars was flat versus the year ago quarter
78,However adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was 0.6 percentage points higher of 31% as a result of the largely fixed cost elements of the cost base
79,Adjusted operating margin was 7.8% and 1.4 percentage points in constant currency
80,"This resulted in adjusted operating income of $242 million, a decrease of 16.7% again in constant currency"
81,So now let's look at our pharmaceutical wholesale division
82,Sales for the division were $5 billion up 0.6% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis
83,Growth was held back by the sale of Alliance Healthcare Russia in March last year and also by the leap year
84,Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 5.2%
85,This was behind the Company's estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales
86,With challenging market conditions in Continental Europe partially offset by growth in emerging markets and the U.K
87,Market growth is particularly strong in certain emerging markets due to the timing of price increases
88,Adjusted operating margin which excludes ABC
89,was 2.9% up 0.2 percentage points on a constant currency basis
90,Adjusted operating income was $226 million up 59.4% in constant currency
91,"Excluding the $79 million and adjusted earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 8.4% in constant currency reflecting procurement and cost benefits"
92,Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.9 billion
93,"During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $1.4 billion"
94,"This reflected our seasonal reduction in inventories, as well as an improved receivables position"
95,Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $261 million
96,This was lower than in the first quarter mainly due to phasing
97,"As I said last quarter, we continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and U.S"
98,"beauty program, as well as the upgrades to our IT systems which we have previously talked about"
99,This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.6 billion
100,"Today, we announced a new share repurchase program of up to $1 billion in this calendar year with the flexibility to do this due to the changes to the pending Rite Aid transaction announced in January"
101,"So turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we have maintained guidance and continue to expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.08."
102,Remember our guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year and no material accretion from Rite Aid or from the new strategic alliance with Prime announced on Monday
103,So I’ll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments
104,I mean on the particular program that we talked about today we obviously are very pleased to have achieved our target the program will conclude as we previously announced – around the end of this fiscal year
105,Some of the benefits of that will obviously – it will continue to see and see more of in the coming years
106,Given that nevertheless looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our sort of businesses is just a way of life
107,So we will absolutely continue to look for opportunities year after year
108,"They will come in different places they may be in different geographies, but there are always opportunities to drive efficiency"
109,And so it's just a never ending
110,"we’ll continue this program will finish, but we’ll continue to look for more opportunities"
111,I think really it always looks at the year-to-date effective tax rate and if you look at that from an adjusted basis as I said that was around 24.5%
112,So I think tax obviously you know mix can change quarter-by-quarter but looking at year-to-date
113,"I think it’s perhaps the best way of thinking about this discrete items of course the timing of those, there was a little bit uncertain and they can go up or down but think of the year-to-date"
114,I mean obviously we haven’t given specific guidance by segment we had first provide by reiterating our overall guidance figures I mean in terms of thinking about sort of the modeling
115,There is going to be a number of factors that you've got to think about and firstly we will we are consolidating the new Prime deal from Monday when we completed it
116,You need to think about that in factoring the U.S
117,model recognizing obviously that is a specialty on mail business with different dynamics
118,"In terms of the international businesses, I think as we've said in the prepared remarks there is still the challenge in the U.K"
119,with the NHS having cut the reimbursement that will continue the basis has performed robustly as we said over key customer period
120,But retailing is still itself quite challenging particularly in the U.K
121,which is our largest market
122,"And then on wholesale sales, wholesale always a its kind of business or division that operates in a number of markets you can always get certain mix affect quarter-by-quarter"
123,So it's tough to model
124,I know quarter-by-quarter
125,but I did point out in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets we had some growth really in the period when you get price changes in the market where people tend to buy ahead of customers buy ahead of the price change and that was the notable impact in the second quarter
126,Well just on the accounting side
127,I mean we will account for it on a fully consolidated basis
128,"So when you're looking at our of sales, our adjusted operating income then you will obviously see a 100% of the entities results coming through, but then when you're actually looking at an earnings attributable to our shareholders to the WBA shareholders, we strip out and align the proportion that is attributable to Prime itself and I think as we said we own just over 50% of the business"
129,So when you thinking of EPS then it will be our share if you thinking of operating it's a 100% also in the accounting books
130,Anything that goes through the venture that the new combined venture as to say we show a 100% in revenue 100% in adjusted operating income
131,but then we strip as I say at the lower end of the P&L that the Prime share
132,So when we are looking at adjusted earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance staffs got their share netted out
