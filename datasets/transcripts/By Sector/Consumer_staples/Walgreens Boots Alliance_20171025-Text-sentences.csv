1,"We have delivered a strong business performance in the year, both in terms of adjusted profit and cash flow despite currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions"
2,"In the fourth quarter, we recognized, of course, that our GAAP numbers have been significantly impacted by the Rite Aid-related costs, including the merger termination fees"
3,"However, overall, on an adjusted basis, the final quarter was better mainly due to U.S"
4,pharmacy volumes and market share continuing to grow in line with our strategy
5,"As you know, on 29th June, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase program"
6,"During the quarter, we purchased $3.8 billion of shares, and since the fiscal year-end, have completed the repurchases"
7,"In keeping with our commitment to operate as efficient a balance sheet as possible, we've decided to add an additional $1 billion to the program"
8,This is in addition to our routine anti-dilutive share repurchases
9,"Of course, our other recent news was Rite Aid regulatory clearance in September, which I'll come onto shortly"
10,"First, I will take you through our fourth quarter results"
11,"As we indicated throughout the year, we expected the fourth quarter to be particularly strong"
12,"As you can see, this is the case"
13,"Currency had a negative impact, the U.S"
14,dollar being around 4.4% stronger versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year
15,This impact was less significant than in the first three quarters
16,"Sales for the quarter were $30.1 billion, up 5.3% versus the comparable quarter"
17,"On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.4%"
18,"GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 2.3%"
19,"GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $802 million, down 22.1% and diluted EPS was $0.76."
20,"This was 20% lower than the comparable quarter last year due to Rite Aid-related costs, mainly merger termination fees"
21,"Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, up 21.2%, and in constant currency, up 22.3%"
22,"Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 18.8%, and in constant currency, up 19.1%"
23,"Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.31, up 22.4%"
24,"The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 24.6%"
25,This was 6.3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year
26,"When you'll recall, we particularly benefited from positive discrete items"
27,"Our core tax rate, which excludes discrete tax impacts, was in line with our rate in the third quarter"
28,"So turning now to the performance of our segments, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA"
29,"Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $22.3 billion, up 7.5% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.1%"
30,"Adjusted gross profit was $5.6 billion, up 4.3% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in both pharmacy and retail"
31,"Adjusted SG&A was 18.9% of sales, an improvement of 1.8 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter"
32,Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales has improved versus comparable quarters for 17 consecutive quarters
33,"Adjusted operating margin was 6.3%, up 1 percentage point, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 27.5%"
34,"So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy"
35,U.S
36,pharmacy total sales were up 12.6%
37,"We filled 250.2 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 9%"
38,"On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, our pharmacy sales increased by 5.6% with scripts filled up 8.7%"
39,This was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships
40,"Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics"
41,"Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.5%, up approximately 120 basis points over the year-ago quarter"
42,Total retail sales were down 3.9% on the same quarter last year
43,This includes the impact of the previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations
44,"Comparable retail sales were down 2.1% in the quarter, with declines in consumables and general merchandise and the personal care categories partially offset by growth in the beauty and health and wellness categories"
45,"Compared to prior quarters, comparable sales were lower, partially through changes to our promotional plans as we focused on delivering improved margins"
46,"Gross profit and margin were higher than in the same quarter last year, mainly due to actions we took in the fourth quarter last year to put in place foundations for long-term growth"
47,"In addition, margin was higher due to the changes to promotions, as I just mentioned, and improved mix as we increasingly focus on higher-margin categories"
48,"On the last call I told you that we were implementing a program in approximately 1,500 stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance"
49,"This program has now been completed and we're starting to see the early benefits, including ongoing efficiencies and reduced working capital"
50,Our beauty differentiation program has driven profit and margin improvement as our own brands continued to perform well
51,"Beauty category sales in beauty differentiation stores continued to be markedly better than in other stores, supported by strong sales growth of No7 and Soap & Glory"
52,In line with our strategy of introducing new owned brands to our U.S
53,"stores, we launched two terrific cosmetics brands during the quarter"
54,"CYO is our new and exciting makeup collection developed by Boots in Nottingham, which is designed to encourage our younger customers to be colorful and creative"
55,"We have, in addition, launched Sleek MakeUP in Walgreens stores and online after a successful launch in Boots two years ago"
56,"Sleek is one of our fastest-growing brands in the UK, with a young, ethnically diverse customer base"
57,"Since the year-end, we have launched a brand-new skincare range, YourGoodSkin, which is exclusive to Walgreens and Boots"
58,"Developed by our scientists, the product is designed to promote visibly healthier skin"
59,"As well as developing our offer of own brands, as I said on the last earnings call, we are introducing our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores"
60,"This program is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, bringing the total number of stores with the enhanced beauty offering to around 2,900."
61,So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division
62,"Sales for the division were $2.9 billion, down 0.4% in constant currency"
63,Comparable store sales decreased 0.2% in constant currency
64,"Comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher prescription volumes in the UK, with Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales up 1.2%"
65,"Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 0.5%, with Boots UK's comparable retail sales decreasing 1.3%"
66,"This was due to a decline across a number of product categories, with beauty being impacted by the timing of new product launches"
67,"We've continued our work on cost control in the quarter, while putting in place the foundations for future growth"
68,"Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 0.8% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, mainly due to lower retail gross profit"
69,"This was more than compensated by lower adjusted SG&A, which was down versus the year-ago quarter on a constant currency basis"
70,"As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A on a constant currency basis was 0.9 percentage points lower at 32.8%, reflecting work we have done to reduce costs, particularly in the UK"
71,"Adjusted operating margin was 8.9%, up 0.8 percentage points in constant currency"
72,"This resulted in adjusted operating income of $261 million, an increase of 8.9%, again, in constant currency"
73,This was a much better performance than in the first three quarters due to the measures we've taken to reduce costs
74,So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division
75,"Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, up 5.4% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis"
76,"This was ahead of the company's estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with growth in emerging markets and the UK being partially offset by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe"
77,"Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.5%, down 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis"
78,"This was mainly due to lower gross margin, including some generic procurement pressures in the quarter"
79,"The division benefited from $84 million in adjusted earnings from ABC, up $34 million versus the same quarter last year, mainly due to our increased level of ownership"
80,"Adjusted operating income was $221 million, up 11.5% in constant currency"
81,So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2017.
82,"As I've said, this has been a strong financial year, with results coming in just above the top end of our guidance"
83,"In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.78 was down 1%"
84,"This decrease primarily reflects a number of special items, including, as I said previously, the Rite Aid merger termination fees"
85,"Importantly, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 11.1% to $5.10, up 12.9% in constant currency"
86,The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.2%
87,"During the year, we particularly benefited from favorable discrete items"
88,"As ever, the tax rate also reflects the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings and the U.S"
89,taxation of our non-U.S
90,entities
91,Operating cash flow was $2 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion in the full fiscal year
92,"Over the course of the year, our working capital inflow was $1.5 billion, reflecting improved payables and lower days inventory"
93,"As a result of our focus on driving working capital efficiency, over the last two years, we've generated $2.9 billion of positive cash flow"
94,Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $439 million
95,"For the fiscal year, expenditure totaled $1.4 billion, which was broadly in line with last year"
96,"We continued to invest in key areas to develop our core customer proposition, including our stores and U.S"
97,"beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we've previously talked about"
98,"Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $1.6 billion and an impressive $5.9 billion in the full fiscal year"
99,"In addition to the share repurchase program, which I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we made early repayments of $2.6 billion of debt to further optimize our balance sheet"
100,So turning next to Rite Aid
101,"As you know, in September, we secured regulatory clearance for the purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores and related assets"
102,"We're delighted to be completing this transaction, which will extend our network, particularly in the Northeast and Southern states"
103,"In the past week, we've acquired the first stores to confirm the operational readiness of the key Rite Aid transitional IT systems"
104,We will then begin acquiring stores in phases with completion anticipated in spring 2018.
105,"To deliver the full benefit of the acquisition, we must, of course, fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores into the Walgreens network"
106,"This is a relatively complex, time-consuming and costly process"
107,"Initially, Rite Aid is providing transitional services for all acquired stores"
108,"Over time, we will transfer these stores onto Walgreens' existing IT systems prior to rebranding as Walgreens with our full retail offer"
109,We expect to complete the integration of the acquired stores and related assets within the next three years
110,The acquisition-related costs of this are estimated to be approximately $750 million
111,"In addition, we plan to invest around $500 million in incremental capital expenditure on store conversions and related activities"
112,"As previously announced, we expect to realize synergies of over $300 million per annum, which we anticipate realizing within the next four years"
113,"Following regulatory clearance, we have been able to complete a comprehensive review of the combined store portfolio to determine the scope for optimizing locations"
114,"This has resulted in our decision to close approximately 600 stores and related assets over an 18-month period, beginning in spring 2018."
115,"We estimate the cost of this program to be approximately $450 million, substantially all cash spend"
116,The resulting cost savings are expected to be approximately $300 million per annum by the end of the fiscal year 2020.
117,"We will, of course, when reporting our adjusted operating results, adjust out both the acquisition-related and optimization program costs"
118,So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2018.
119,We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70.
120,"As usual, this guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year"
121,"As we've said before, we do not expect the Rite Aid transaction to significantly impact adjusted diluted net earnings per share in this period"
122,"As I'm sure you'll appreciate, the recent hurricanes have been very challenging and continue to be so in Puerto Rico, where Walgreens is the largest pharmacy chain"
123,We are very proud of all our people who have worked tirelessly to give our customers access to the medicines they need
124,"Based on our work to-date, our initial estimates indicate that the cost of the storm damage and store closures could be around $90 million"
125,The majority of this is in Puerto Rico
126,We plan to adjust for this when reporting our first quarter results
127,"The damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure continues to impact everyday life, including trading in our stores"
128,"We estimate that in the first quarter, this could adversely impact adjusted earnings per share by a few cents"
129,Moving on to Med Part D
130,"Although it's not our usual practice to comment on future sales expectations, given recent market speculation, I feel that it's worthwhile to point out that in 2018, we're expecting Walgreens to grow its Med Part D business year-over-year"
131,"While not material, you should also note that our partnership agreement with Fareva, which includes the sale of our contract manufacturing business, this will commence at the end of October"
132,"As a result, in the future, we won't have these low margin sales within Retail Pharmacy International"
133,"Thinking about phasing, we expect this year to be more balanced between the two halves"
134,I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments
135,Really nothing to – I really don't have much to add to what we said in the prepared statements and
136,just what Alex has said
137,"Just I think the one thing I would add to Alex, if you remember in the third quarter when we were looking at gross profit percentage and RPI, I drew attention to the fact that we'd obviously post the establishment of the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime joint venture, which we consolidate"
138,"If you recall, I said that impacted the mix by about 100 basis points, and of course we didn't have a full three months in at that time"
139,So it's just worth bearing that in mind
140,"But I mean, we're very pleased, as you can see, with the progress that we're making in both the retail and the pharmacy part of our business in the States"
141,"Thanks, George"
142,I very much tried in my prepared remarks to really point you in the direction of our thinking
143,"Obviously, we don't give specific guidance on adjusted operating growth in total or in our divisions, but I think from what you've said, you'll gather that we're very confident that we can continue to grow our business through that combination of driving the top line, managing the margins and obviously, keeping a very, very tight control of the costs because saving costs is very much our way of life"
144,"The one thing I would sort of just, I think, remind everyone is, of course, that in this new fiscal year, we'll have a full year of contribution from the Prime acquisition which resulted in the forming of our AllianceRx business"
145,"Well, the main cost transformation program, obviously, we completed that last year"
146,"and we were delighted with the results and the costs, as you've seen, have come in exactly where we anticipated them to be"
147,"In terms of the store optimization program that we've announced today, clearly the majority of that is cash"
148,and then we're going to have the investment in the capital in the Rite Aid stores and the conversion and the rebranding
149,And so we've tried to give that factor into guidance
150,But I'm very confident about our ability to continue to deliver a really strong cash flow
151,"I think as I explained in my remarks, we had another very strong year for cash flow in the year just ended, the same the prior year"
152,"We were really able to really continue, in particular, to improve our working capital efficiency"
153,"We talk a lot about driving cost efficiency, which is a way of life, but similarly continuing to improve working capital is a way of life as well"
154,And so I'm very confident that we're going to continue to really be a very strong cash generative business going forward
155,"And obviously, when it comes to the returns on all the projects that we do, similarly as I think we've said on many times, we're very disciplined in the way we evaluate all our capital expenditure and investment programs"
156,And I'm very confident that we'll get the returns on those
157,"Thanks, Bryan"
158,"Again, as you know, the sizable amount of these stores, not the majority in this occasion, have been remodeled"
159,"So therefore, they are in good shape"
160,"However, there are some which are very important just from a network point of view that would require some additional capital"
161,"And also as we develop the front-end proposition in Walgreens further, we'll have the opportunity to move some of that investment with a good return also into these stores"
162,"So again George has mentioned a figure for, not just for integration, but a figure also of $0.5 billion"
163,I think it was more or less for capital improvement into the stores that we're buying and remaining open going forward
164,"Eric, if you worked for Walgreens, you know that you'd know the answer, but unfortunately, we can't give you the answer"
165,"We don't give that level of details, and I'm really sorry we can't give that"
166,But we keep on reassuring you that we understand the model really well
167,We are working diligently to apply that model appropriately in the U.S
168,and we believe we're making strong progress
169,and you can see that coming through at an economic value that Stefano described
170,"So again, we're into almost 3,000, 2,900 stores with the differentiation"
171,We have farther to go much more opportunity there
172,"You can see that we have also materially improved the cost of goods, both in the retail side and also on the generic side, again, (55:45)"
173,that constant working with suppliers and long-term ways to make that happen
174,And you can see how we are carefully investing our cash as well as our operating costs to drive improvements in volume and also improvements in customer experience
175,"Our internal Net Promoter Score's and many of our brand measures are improving going forward towards more of a pharmacy-led health, wellness and beauty retailer"
176,So we continue to work diligently on this model
177,We continue to believe strongly that we absolutely know more about the American market has achieved it
178,"We understand the customer is changing, we understand the market is changing and we will adapt appropriately"
179,"So again, I don't know what more we can say"
180,We can't give you any more detail
181,But I promise you that we are satisfied with the progress we are making
182,"Hi, Ricky"
183,"Again, just on the FedEx point, I just want to say what a fantastic partnership we have here"
184,"And also when you think about the idea of the last mile and having the ability to really deliver in the last mile, we believe this FedEx partnership, which we've rolled out in a matter of months to every single drugstore apart from those affected by the hurricane, as Stefano said, is not available to our customers and to FedEx's business partners as well"
185,So I think that's just one quick example of how we are rapidly changing with the market as it rapidly changes
186,"And I think that this idea of the last mile, which many people are struggling with, many – particularly the online business are struggling with"
187,"I think the stat in the marketplace is that 30% of e-commerce get returned, for example, parcels get returned, reversal in the supply chain is a big customer problem"
188,Piracy is a big customer problem
189,"We believe that with the best last mile, working with people at FedEx and many others, we can solve some of these problems for businesses and for customers and that's what we intend to do"
190,"So, Ricky, I didn't quite catch your question"
191,Could you repeat your question?
192,I apologize
193,I couldn't quite hear the end of your question
194,"In pharmacy, yeah, I mean, obviously, that's an opportunity going forward"
195,We look at – we work hard on costs and still reducing that cost in the pharmacy
196,"We are very convenient, close to many, many customers, both patients and people who buy retail products, I said before"
197,So that's an opportunity for sure that we are looking at and I'm going to let you know if we do anything about it
198,But that is certainly one of the opportunities with this partnership
199,I'll take up on that
200,"But on the guidance, obviously, on our prepared comments, you've seen we just gave guidance at the adjusted EPS level,"
201,so we haven't given the composition
202,"But notwithstanding that, I would really stress that we are continuing to look to drive SG&A efficiencies"
203,It's very much a way of life
204,"Clearly, we'll have additional costs coming in as we go through the Rite Aid transition"
205,So we won't be quite comparing apples with apples as we go through that period
206,But the focus on improving SG&A will continue to be absolutely relentless
207,It's just the way of life
208,"We will, of course, also then have the mix effect from the Prime because we'll have Prime acquisition because we'll have a full year in the coming year"
209,"and I think as Alex has already explained, there's a mix effect in terms of"
210,", it's a lower percentage gross margin by nature"
211,"In terms of the tax rate, we've not given specific guidance for tax, but as I said in my prepared comments, our effective tax rate excluding ABC equity income was 23.2%"
212,"Within that, there was a couple of percent of discrete items"
213,"So, excluding discretes, we were 25.2%"
214,"And of course, the level of discretes can tend to vary year-by-year"
215,"The final point, really, would be post, in terms of you thinking tax post Rite Aid, and of course, we will have a higher proportion of income as we start to see the accretion come through from Rite Aid over time"
216,"and we will start to have a higher proportion, other things being equal, in the U.S"
217,", which of course continues to be one of the highest tax rates really in the world at the moment"
218,"We've not given the specific guidance beyond what we've said in numerical terms, but to help you with your thinking, in terms of the Rite Aid stores, we'll be acquiring them on a phased basis"
219,"And as we've said, we've just acquired the first few in the last week or so to start testing the IT systems"
220,"So we'll be acquiring those on a phased basis over the next six, seven months until the spring of next year"
221,"We then have the store optimization program which I talked about, which Alex has elaborated on a little more detail, which is when we acquire the stores over time, we then have to really treat them like internal file buys and do the conversion"
222,And that is going to take roughly – we've got an 18-month program from the spring of 2018 through to the end of 2019.
223,And then we have got to convert –
224,"as we convert the existing stores, we've got to do the remerchandising, the rebranding, putting in our IT systems, getting everyone trained up,"
225,"particularly the pharmacists on our pharmacy management program, which is very important part and obviously moved the logistics over"
226,"So really, as we've said originally, it will take a number of years to complete that till we absolutely see the full benefit from the Rite Aid transaction, which we're very confident about"
227,"As I said before, we only give guidance on one number"
228,"A lot of our focus is on improving our offer, as Alex has said, and driving overall shareholder value creation of profit"
229,"And mix, it's not just all about driving the top line, what's important is growing in a profitable way"
230,"And we're very disciplined in the way we evaluate our promotions so that we don't unnecessarily promote when it doesn't make economic sense to do so, and we're very focused on improving the mix"
231,"And I think as Alex had said again a few minutes ago, the lessons that we learned from Boots in particularly developing our own differentiated offering, particularly in the beauty area is a key component of being able to do that"
232,"And of course, it offers our customers fantastic products at fantastic value"
233,"Really, I would just re-emphasize what I said in guidance"
234,"As I said, I think that in the phasing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect this to be more balanced but between the two halves"
235,"I think when we gave guidance a year ago, we always explained that fiscal 2017 would be more weighted towards the final quarter"
236,"And obviously, the results that we've announced today demonstrate that"
237,"So I would think, think more balanced would be really the best way of thinking about it"
238,"Sure, Charles"
239,"As Stefano said, we have a lot of pilots and tests in the marketplace"
240,"Again, we are very pleased with the progress on all of them"
241,"They're really testing, at this stage, consumer behavior"
242,We'll currently (01:16:17) get consumers and patients to see us differently and use these services that we are now providing
243,"So just some examples, LabCorp, as you said, that's a recent one"
244,"That's early, but the early indications are positive"
245,"And of course, we learned something from the previous experience we had in terms of customer experience with the team we had before"
246,"Secondly, we are moving to an increased number of pilots in optical"
247,"We have a big business in the UK, a very successful business in the UK and global partnerships with the most important partners in this industry in the UK and are bringing all of that knowhow to the American market"
248,"And again, we're pleased with the progress so far"
249,"Hearingcare, again, we have a successful business in the UK"
250,"We understand the model very well and again, we're bringing that here to the U.S"
251,in a test and trial here in the U.S
252,"And again, that's happening just after Christmas"
253,"And last but not least, we talked about urgent care where, again, with MedExpress, we're in the ground (01:17:25) in urgent care"
254,"And again, that is going well so far"
255,"So again, using our physical convenient locations, using our healthcare brand, working in partnerships to give them access to our Walgreens customers and of course, working together to make sure that we target people through data in the most appropriate ways are all part of what we're doing right now in terms of developing new business models in that healthcare space"
256,"All work in progress, all being properly managed, all with the best partners in the U.S"
257,"market and so far, so good"
258,It's really early
259,"I mean, at the moment, we're really"
260,I go back to
261,"– we're looking at customer behavior and how that's changing inside of the Walgreens brand and inside the Walgreens box, the properties"
262,And it's very encouraging
263,"So, of course, we'll analyze what we bring"
264,"We bring great locations, we bring a great brand to which customers associate healthcare"
265,"But we also, as Stefano said, believe in partnerships"
266,We believe in not having to build things that already successfully built
267,So we will assess all of that in urgent care
268,"But you're right, more and more healthcare is going to be delivered in communities and many people see the drugstores today as an ideal place to deliver these healthcare services"
269,"And of course, we are doing lots of work to understand what that could look like in the future, as I said, with the very best partners and urgent care, for sure, is a good example of that"
270,"Sure, yeah"
271,"We rolled something called take back out, I believe it was about 18 months ago"
272,was our first take back
273,"And now, we've now got that in 800 pharmacies evenly spread across the U.S"
274,"And we're now expanding that by another I, think, it's 800 in partnership with our key partners to provide that service even closer to communities in America"
275,So people can bring back their unwanted drugs out of their bathroom cabinets to make sure they're not available for misuse
276,"That program is going very well, I think and the ones we have at the moment, we've got about"
277,", I think, it's 80 million tons of drugs back, so that program is going very well"
278,and we're delighted that others are also doing that now as well
