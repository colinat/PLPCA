114,"Before I turn it back to Inge, let me address a few items that we anticipate will happen over the remainder of 2017."
115,The net impact of these items is factored into our EPS guidance today
116,"First, as you may recall, in December we announced the divestiture of our Identity Management business within Safety & Graphics"
117,"The sale of this business, which has annual sales of approximately $205 million, is expected to close during the second quarter"
118,"Upon completion, we expect to record a gain on sale of approximately $0.55 per share, partially offset by the profit that will go with the business in 2017 after the divestiture is closed"
119,"In addition, recall at our Investor Meeting in March 2016, we introduced a plan to better optimize our portfolio and supply chain footprint"
120,"We expect to make significant progress on that plan in 2017, with associated costs in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share over the remainder of the year"
121,We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share will incur in Q2.
122,"In total, the net impact of these items is expected to add between $0.05 and $0.10 to 2017 earnings per share"
123,"Again, this impacted is reflected in our full-year updated guidance, which Inge will now cover on slide 17."
124,Inge?
125,"Good morning, Andy"
126,"Andy, thanks for the question"
127,You covered quite a few things there
128,"Just from an overall theme standpoint, Andy, we're always looking for opportunities to enhance the value of the enterprise, and that's really part of our business model"
129,"What you see in the first quarter for incremental investments, some of that was investments we were taking to accelerate growth"
130,And that was really lined up with what we had shared last December of the incremental $100 million over the course of 2017 to deliver accelerated growth throughout the year
131,"The other context I'd share with you in thinking about this step up in strategic investments, if you think back to last March at our investor meeting when we laid out our five-year plan, we shared plans for optimizing our portfolio and supply chain footprint with at that time what we described a total of between $500 million and $600 million of investments, and ultimately that we expected that by 2020 to be creating $125 million to $175 million of annualized benefit, operating income benefit"
132,What you're seeing in this step up of accelerated strategic investments both for the quarter and for the year is us taking more action related to what we laid out last year for the optimized actions on our supply chain footprint
133,"Yeah, Joe, as the quarter went on, it was consistent strength across the quarter, all three months of the quarter"
134,"And I'd further add, we're seeing April, the start of April, tracking very much in line with what we've been seeing for the first quarter, so really no intra-quarter trend changes to note"
135,"Yes, Julian, we're not fundamentally seeing any change in our pricing power"
136,That remains strong
137,We do continue to look for targeted places where we can use price to help drive organic volume growth
138,"If I look out over total 2017, we're expecting U.S"
139,price growth to be approximately flat
140,"If I expand it to the total globe, if I pull out the FX impact, we expect pricing to be up slightly"
141,Our normal range is 30 to 50 basis points of core price growth
142,I think it will be somewhere between there and flat for total 2017.
143,"Yes, of the $136 million in strategic investments in the first quarter, Julian, a little less than half of that is investments that we see having a fairly short-term return in 2017 and into early 2018."
144,"And those are primarily growth-oriented investments, and those growth-oriented investments were factored into the guidance we set out for the year"
145,"The remainder of the strategic investments, those relate to our portfolio, supply chain footprint"
146,And that's really laid out aligned closely with the plan that we put forward a year ago in March
147,"No, Julian"
148,"Yes, so in December when we laid out our guidance, EPS guidance for the year, strategic investments we had incrementally in a $0.05 to $0.10 range"
149,That was aligned primarily â€“ or almost exclusively with our growth investments
150,"Now what you're seeing, we're seeing the growth investments play out exactly as we guided, still in that $0.05 to $0.10 range for the total year"
151,What we're layering on top of that is additional footprint actions and portfolio actions that we're taking throughout 2017.
152,"So on top of the growth investments, there's roughly an incremental $0.10 of supply chain and portfolio actions that we took in the first quarter of 2017."
153,"And then in terms of the guidance for the balance of this year, for Q2, Q3, and Q4, there's an extra $0.40 to $0.45 on top of that that was not part of our initial guidance"
154,"So all in, the growth investments, the incremental $0.10 that we took in the first quarter plus what we're expecting Q2 through Q4, it's now in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 for the total year"
155,"Nigel, we're always, as I said earlier, we're always looking for opportunities"
156,"The level that we were investing in Q1 in strategic investments around growth, no pull forward there"
157,That's coming exactly as we had planned
158,"The increased strategic investments around portfolio actions and the supply chain footprint, that's aligned with our longer-term vision"
159,The exact timing of when we were going to do that we did not have clarity on until we started pulling the trigger on some of those actions in the first quarter and some that we expect to have happen over the next three quarters
160,So I'm not sure I'd characterize it as a pull forward as much as it would be now
161,is the time that it looked like the right time for us to pull the trigger on actions that we had laid out last March
162,"No, the $0.40 to $0.45 does not include anything for Scott Safety"
163,"At the time that closes, we will update guidance to take into account any impact that will have on our 2017 earnings"
164,"Yes, first of all, you heard Inge talked about some of the channel impacts in our office retail and wholesale channel"
165,"In addition, in our Industrial channel, we are seeing increased confidence in the channel, which we're seeing good sell-out of our product"
166,"We're seeing even stronger sell-in to the industrial channel, primarily in the U.S"
167,So that is one place where we're attributing it to higher confidence amongst that channel and seeing what appears to be some restocking of depleted channel levels that we've seen in the past
168,"Jeff, to your first question on the tax rate for what we're now seeing for total 2017, there are a few dynamics going on"
169,"First of all, we are seeing a favorable geographic profit mix for us that is helping us in our tax rate"
170,"It's been a headwind for us the last couple years, and that's switching over to a tailwind for us this year"
171,"We're also seeing some of the benefits, as you'd expect, from some of our tax planning"
172,But one of the more significant items just in the first quarter is the benefit we're getting from the accounting standard change that came into effect last year for the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
173,"From a year-on-year basis, that's about a $0.04 benefit versus what we had a year ago"
174,"And, Jeff, I'd say that's the wildcard"
175,"Other things are going very much as we had planned, to get to the 27% tax rate by 2020."
176,"But with the added variability from what happens with this excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, there will be some quarters that's a benefit, and some quarters we won't see any benefit at all"
177,"All in, we're well on track for hitting the 27% in 2020, possibly even lower than that"
178,"But when we have better clarity on that, we'll give a revised number of, can that go even lower than the 27%"
179,"To the second point on the strategic investments, the $136 million, of the growth-related investments, you're correct"
180,Health Care had the majority of that
181,"There were small amounts, single digits of millions of dollars, low to mid-single digits in millions of dollars, in the other four business groups"
182,"And then, from a portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization, the vast majority of that is impacting the Electronics & Energy business, with a little of that hitting the consumer and office business, the Consumer business group"
183,"Rob, as far as the automation portion of our CapEx spending, a year ago at our investor meeting, we laid out that we expected that to be a noticeable part of our CapEx investments"
184,"What we're seeing is, that's playing out exactly as we laid out a year ago, that we're seeing continued opportunities for automation investments within our CapEx plans"
185,"And I wouldn't call it an uptick, but I'd say it's playing out exactly as we laid out"
186,"Scott, the increase in the strategic investments from what we originally guided is really around supply chain and portfolio optimization and much less around growth"
187,"If we see growth even higher than what we're currently expecting, could our growth investments tick up some?"
188,I think the short answer is yes
189,"It could tick up some, but I don't think on a material basis"
190,I think we're now talking single digits of pennies at that point
191,"Good morning, Steve"
192,"Steve, thanks for the question"
193,"Part of what we talked about a little over a year ago at our outlook meeting, for the five-year outlook meeting, is the number of manufacturing sites we have around the world and looking at the productivity in those sites and the opportunity we have through rationalizing the number of those sites, increasing capital into some of our more productive sites, the opportunity to reduce the total footprint of our manufacturing and supply chain sites over the course of the next four years"
194,"So that's what we mean when we talk about it when we laid out a $500 million to $600 million investment that we expect to take, the resulting productivity from that, that by the time we get to 2020 we think that will add another $125 million to $175 million of added operating income through that productivity we can get through rationalizing our supply chain footprint"
195,"If I look at this globally, Steve, we had positive though very small price in all businesses except for Health Care, where we were flat"
196,"Laurence, to the first question on business, and I'll go further in geography, we expect that this action that we're taking in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarter will impact all businesses and all geographies, that it will be broad"
197,"As far as the specific details of each business, we're still working through those details"
198,"We're not ready to be sharing that yet, Laurence"
199,"And then as far as 2017 to 2018, some of these actions will have a tail into 2018, where there will be residual cost impacts hitting us in 2018, though I expect it will not â€"
200,“ I very much expect it will be a decline from the level that we're projecting now for 2017.
