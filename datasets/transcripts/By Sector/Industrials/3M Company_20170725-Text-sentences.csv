0,"Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone"
1,I'll start on slide 5.
2,"As Inge mentioned, GAAP earnings for the quarter were $2.58 per share"
3,"Since we had several moving parts this quarter, I thought I would take a moment to cover each item to make our underlying second quarter performance as clear as possible"
4,"As Inge mentioned, we continue to execute our plans in Q2 to strengthen the company for the future"
5,"During the quarter, we made incremental strategic investments of $178 million; $39 million was growth related and $139 million related to portfolio and footprint actions"
6,"For the second half of the year, we anticipate another $0.20 to $0.25 per share impact from incremental strategic investments, largely footprint related"
7,These actions drive greater productivity from our manufacturing and supply chain base and will improve our service to our customers
8,"Looking ahead, we expect footprint actions to be, at a minimum, an expense of $0.10 per share in 2018."
9,This expectation includes benefits from actions implemented in 2017.
10,"In addition, we had divestiture related activity in the quarter which added $0.57 to GAAP earnings per share, of which $0.54 relates to the identity management business"
11,"Taking into account these items, underlying earnings were $2.25 per share, up 8.2% year-on-year"
12,Please turn to slide 6 for a recap of our quarterly sales performance
13,"We posted good organic growth in the quarter of 3.5%, with volumes up a solid 3.8%"
14,Selling prices were down 30 basis points year-on-year due to a couple of factors
15,"Strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price, and we saw less price growth in Latin America as currencies were more stable versus the U.S"
16,We continued to actively manage the portfolio in Q2 and divested some non-strategic businesses which reduced sales by 100 basis points
17,Foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 60 basis points
18,"All in, second quarter sales, in U.S"
19,"dollars, increased 1.9% versus last year"
20,In the U.S
21,", organic growth was 1.9%, led by a mid-single digit increase in Industrial"
22,Our Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter
23,The Consumer business was down 1% organically in the U.S
24,"in Q2, impacted by continued channel adjustments in the office market"
25,Asia Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10% in Q2.
26,"All business groups within APAC posted strong growth in the quarter, including a double-digit increase in Electronics and Energy and high single-digit growth in each of our other four business groups"
27,Organic growth was 17% in China/Hong Kong and 8% in Japan
28,"Excluding our electronics related businesses, China/Hong Kong grew 12% and Japan was up 4%"
29,"Moving to EMEA, organic growth declined 2% in Q2, with a similar result in West Europe"
30,This area experienced fewer billing days versus last year due to the timing of the Easter holiday
31,"Through the first half of the year, EMEA grew 1% organically, led by our Safety and Graphics and Industrial businesses"
32,"Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 4%, with all businesses posting positive growth"
33,"Health Care led the way, up high single-digits and Consumer grew mid-single digits"
34,"At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong organic growth at 8%"
35,Brazil was up 6% while Canada grew 3%

37,Please turn to slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights
38,"Company-wide second quarter sales were $7.8 billion with net income of $1.6 billion, up 23%"
39,"On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margins were 28%, or 24.3% year-over-year excluding the previously mentioned impact from incremental strategic investments and divestitures"
40,Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the second quarter
41,Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 60 basis points to operating margins
42,Lower raw material costs
43,net of selling price changes added another 10 basis points
44,"Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down 50 basis points in the quarter, while higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points"
45,"Finally, incremental strategic investments reduced margins by 2.3 percentage points and divestiture related activity benefited margins by 6 percentage points"
46,Let's now turn to slide eight for a closer look at earnings per share
47,"Second quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, including a net earnings benefit of $0.33 per share from the combined impact of gains on divestitures which were partially offset by incremental strategic investments and non-repeating lost operating earnings"
48,"Excluding these items, our operating EPS was $2.25, up 8.2% year-on-year"
49,The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.08 per share to Q2 earnings
50,Business transformation continues to have a positive impact on our productivity efforts
51,"Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.05 a share"
52,"Our Q2 tax rate was 26% versus 29.6% in the prior year, which increased earnings by $0.12 per share"
53,"The lower tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, our supply chain centers of expertise, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives"
54,"For the first half of the year, our tax rate was 25%"
55,We now expect the full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% versus a prior range of 26% to 27.5%
56,"Finally, lower shares outstanding and higher interest expense together had a net $0.02 positive impact to EPS"
57,Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow
58,"We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders"
59,"Second quarter free cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $378 million year-on-year"
60,Free cash flow conversion was 85% in the quarter
61,"And for the full year, we now anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 100%, versus 95% to 105% previously"
62,The adjustment to the high end of the range is primarily due to the gain on sale of identity management
63,"Second quarter capital expenditures were $302 million, and for the full year we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion"
64,"During the quarter, we paid $701 million in cash dividends to shareholders and also returned $494 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases"
65,"In the first half of the year, we repurchased $1.2 billion in stock and now expect full-year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $3.5 billion versus $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion previously"

128,and I will now turn the call back over Inge
129,"Good morning, Andrew"
130,"Yeah, Andy, in the case of pricing both for the quarter and for the year, we're not â€"
131,"“ if I think about 3M's business model, where we take technology, use that to create value for the customers, that ultimately creates our fundamental pricing power"
132,That hasn't changed
133,That remains strong
134,"For the second quarter, we saw price down 30 basis points and as you mentioned we saw it down approximately 40 basis points in the U.S"
135,"On a global basis, what we're seeing, Andy, is two main things that have changed from first quarter are strong growth in electronics which was much more of a price down that the other businesses that we saw that strong volume growth there contributed to more negative price growth in Asia Pacific"
136,"And then in Latin America, where we often see price growth often driven by a weakening currencies against the U.S"
137,"dollar, we saw much more stable currencies there versus the U.S"
138,"dollar, so some of the corresponding price growth we see didn't materialize"
139,The core price growth and this gets into what we saw in the United States
140,"Core price growth, we traditionally see somewhere between 30 basis points and 50 basis points of core price growth"
141,", we see ourselves now tracking to the low end of what we've been expecting for price growth"
142,We expect it to be closer to flat for the total year in the U.S
143,"And we are taking in some markets selected price adjustments to gain market share, to accelerate volume growth"
144,Some examples are our Industrial business and our Consumer business
145,"Yeah, John, you know as well as I do, it's a competitive world"
146,"We're constantly working to, how can we gain the market share that we think our products should be having?"
147,"In this kind of competitive world, we keep looking for â€"
148,“ where are there opportunities where price could have been a barrier for us taking market share?
149,"And in a couple of businesses I mentioned, Industrial and Consumer as well as Electronics in Asia"
150,", we look for where there are those opportunities"
151,"Partly how I think about this, John, we're also through our investments to accelerate growth as we're investing more dollars to commercialize many of our existing product lines"
152,In some of those cases we looked at where are there opportunities where price â€
153,“ our current price position could be a barrier to us reaching the maximum market share potential that we felt we could attain
154,And we're making those selected adjustments
155,I do think we are at probably the peak of the price declines that we've taken to do that
156,I don't see much further downward pressure from the momentum we've had
157,"And if anything, I see the second half of the year with some uptick in that pricing"
158,"Yeah, John, I think the fair way to characterize it is, these are 3M decisions we're making not responses we're making in the market"
159,These are 3M driven actions
160,"I'll talk broadly on returning cash to shareholders and then go into specifically what you're asking on the dividend, and the share repurchases"
161,"So you know for us, John, returning cash to shareholders is a priority"
162,and we do it both through dividends
163,and we do it through share repurchases
164,"On the dividend front, we've reached a point where we think our dividend payout ratio is in the zone that we want it to be, and future increases in our dividend over time, we expect to be very similar to what we anticipate for earnings per share growth"
165,"So in the coming years, we expect our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time"
166,"On the share repurchase front, that's more dynamic for us, and you've probably heard me say this before, we have a two-fold strategy there"
167,"We do maintain a consistent presence in the market with a base level of repurchases, and then we augment that with opportunistic buyback based on relative value"
168,"We continually assess the market valuation through our own analysis, comparing it to how the stock is trading, and over time, we've found that to be a good risk-adjusted basis to be creating value"
169,"Now, in the case of lower purchases, both for the quarter and for the year, we adjusted the full-year range down based on where we stand through the first half of the year"
170,The market has been strong and we're exercising discipline
171,And we anticipate that there will continue to be opportunities in the future to effectively deploy capital to maximize those returns
172,I would also add that our allocation of capital to share buyback is also influenced by other demands on capital such as M&A
173,"There's a bit of a wait and see on that, John, that we still plan to be putting significant capital into share repurchases"
174,"We have announced our planned acquisition of Scott Safety, which we anticipate to happen in the second half of the year"
175,"But as you know, this type of market, there can be dynamics, so we are keeping our options open for the second half of the year"
176,"Rob, you can think of our growth investments this year in two big components"
177,"One is our investments in growth, and that's the minority part of the investment"
178,and it's aligned with what we originally guided back in December about an incremental $100 million that we anticipate to be spending in growth investments
179,"There's a number of core product platforms we have that we're investing in commercialization dollars in some cases that can be advertising, merchandising, in some cases it can be people involved in adding people in the actual selling process of our products"
180,"And we anticipate that that will add 50 basis points to 100 basis points to our growth for the total year, and that's factored into our guidance now"
181,"And through the first half of the year, Rob, we're seeing our growth and our expenditures on that front tracking very much in line"
182,But that's the minority of our total strategic investments
183,The more significant thing on strategic investments for us in 2017 is the actions we're taking in optimizing our manufacturing supply chain footprint
184,And that aligns with what we shared in March of 2016 when we laid out our five-year plan
185,"And in optimizing our footprint and our manufacturing base, we anticipated over a period of the next few years we'd be investing between $500 million and $600 million, in some cases closing manufacturing sites and shifting manufacturing and expanding manufacturing in our more efficient sites, ultimately to reduce our total manufacturing footprint, to improve efficiency and to improve our ability to service our customers"
186,Most of what you're seeing under strategic investments fits under that strategy
187,"We took a number of actions in the second quarter, and in terms of the return, the way we've quantified that there's a couple ways I can quantify that for you, Rob"
188,"One is, by 2020 we anticipate that this will increase our operating income annually between $125 million and $175 million"
189,That's one way for you to think of it
190,Another way is that we anticipate that this will be greater than a 30% return on investment for the investment that we're taking on this footprint optimization
191,"For the raw materials, the $0.10 to $0.15 that we anticipated of benefits at the beginning of the year, there's been puts and takes as we go along on the raw material side, but so far we're still seeing ourselves in that range of $0.10 to $0.15."
192,"I'd say, the potential were, in the last couple of years"
193,were we could go past that number
194,", I don't see that is a very high probability"
195,"I see this in this range, maybe $0.10 being a little towards the bottom end of that range based on what we're seeing in the raw material markets today"
196,"On the pricing front, I don't know what to repeat, but other than there have been these isolated places where we've taken action"
197,"In the second half of the year, we expect a more normal price growth for 3M as we've put in plan some actions to be bringing price back to a more normal level that we've historically experienced in 3M"
198,"So I don't see much changing on that front from our original guidance, Nigel"
199,"On the strategic investment around growth, when we started the year we said that we expected that to be an incremental $0.10 expense"
200,and we continue to expect it to be that incremental $0.10.
201,We're not increasing that number any further
202,"And then on the price growth, Well, I'd say it is a more normal range"
203,", I do think it'll still be to the lower end on price growth in the second half of the year, approaching in the positive zone, but not up to the whole 30 basis points to 50 basis points that we normally are getting for core price growth"
204,"Yeah, when it comes to the comps, there's a couple of different things going on"
205,"One, like for instance our Electronics and Industrial, both of those, I agree with you, we're going to have slightly tougher comps in the second half of the year"
206,"In the case of Consumer and in Health Care, both of those will be seeing easier comps"
207,I wouldn't call it a big statement on our fact that we're seeing an improving economy
208,We're seeing a fairly stable economy outlook for the balance of the year
209,"Our move in the organic growth range to now would be 3% to 5% and take us confidence in our ability to maintain the growth trajectory even with the tougher comp that we'll be facing, primarily in the fourth quarter"
210,Yeah
211,"Julian, if I think about the different quarters, as you're talking about Q1, Q2, we did see core underlying margin expansion once we strip out the gains in the strategic investments in Q1."
212,"And in Q2, we're more or less flat"
213,So that's mathematically much of what's describing what you're seeing there on that EPS differential between Q1 and Q2.
214,"As we dissect that a little deeper, Julian, where did we not see some of the margin expansion we had seen in the past, and what does that mean for the second half of the year?"
215,Our Industrial business is one of those businesses where we didn't see as much leverage as we have seen in the past
216,"And as we look to the second half of the year, we're expecting for the total year that we're going to be seeing 50 basis points at a minimum, possibly higher, of year-on-year margin expansion, stripping out the gain and strategic investment impact, so if we get to the underlying 50 basis points or slightly higher"
217,"Some of the reasons that will drive added leverage in a business such as Industrial, we do see that improved pricing that I talked about earlier"
218,"We do see improved results from our productivity programs, and probably some added belt-tightening going on"
219,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
220,LLC Understood
221,And then just my second and last question would be around the growth outlook in the EMEA region
222,I think a lot of companies this earnings have talked about a disconnect of the good soft data not necessarily translating into hard orders or sales
223,Should we think about your first half overall organic growth in the region of 1%?
224,That is a good placeholder of what you expect for the second half?
225,And maybe just any update on how you're seeing business in Europe in recent months?
226,"Joe, thanks for asking that question"
227,"There's different types of actions a company like us, like 3M can take"
228,"Sometimes an action where we enter into a restructuring where we're reducing the size of our workforce, that can be a much faster payback"
229,And you've seen actions like that that we've done and see very fast payback
230,"When it comes to optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain footprint, those paybacks take time to materialize"
231,"We don't start seeing benefits, Joe, until we actually have the manufacturing site closed that we've chosen to action, and have the new manufacturing going on in a new location"
232,That takes time to happen
233,"It takes time to work with work councils, with employee organizations, it takes time to, in some places re-qualify that product if we're moving"
234,It can many times be several quarters before we â€
235,“ from the point we announce it until we've actually physically made the change and start realizing those benefits
236,"So this is different, and this is why this one takes longer to get happen"
237,Still a very important part of our strategy though to be by 2020 getting to those savings that we're projecting
238,"Well, I can't speculate on whether there will be more M&A activity that will happen because those we announce once we have clear line of sight that they'll actually happen"
239,"But in terms of the footprint side, we'll still be seeing the negative impact in absolute terms in 2018 on our margin and on our EPS"
240,"We expect in 2019 to become positive, and then by 2020 to be the full amount"
241,"As far as the M&A and what that might do in 2018, I think it's too early for me to speculate on that piece"
242,"No, nothing has changed on that front"
243,Absolutely not
