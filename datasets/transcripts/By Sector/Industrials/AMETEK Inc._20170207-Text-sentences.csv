5,recent quarter trends reflect this stabilization
6,We are encouraged with these trends
7,I am also encouraged by our continued acquisition activity as we announced the acquisition of Rauland-Borg this morning
8,We are very excited to be acquiring Rauland-Borg given their strong niche position within the healthcare market and the outstanding leadership team that is joining AMETEK
9,I will provide more background on this acquisition in a moment
10,"But, first, let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter"
11,Please note that any references on this call to 2016 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis
12,I will discuss the fourth quarter 2016 charges in a moment
13,"Sales were in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter at $973 million, down 1.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2015."
14,"Organic sales were down 3.5%, acquisitions at 3% (03:00) and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter"
15,"Overall orders in the fourth quarter were up 1% and organic orders were down 1%, continuing an improving trend in organic orders for 2016."
16,"Operating income in the quarter was $212.7 million, and operating income margin was 21.9%"
17,"Diluted earnings per share were $0.58, down 8% over the last year's fourth quarter"
18,"Operating cash flow was excellent at $247 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year"
19,"This was a record level of operating cash flow, and it speaks to the strong operating performance across the company"
20,"For the full year 2016, sales were $3.8 billion, down 3% versus 2015."
21,Operating income was $841.4 million and full year operating margins were 21.9%
22,"Diluted earnings per share were $2.30, down 10% versus 2015."
23,"Now, turning to the individual operating groups; first, the Electronic Instruments Group"
24,"For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $616 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter and in line with our expectations"
25,"Organic sales were down 6%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind"
26,"The solid acquisition growth was driven by the contributions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments, and HS Foils"
27,We are seeing solid results from these acquisitions as the teams have done a great job integrating these businesses into AMETEK
28,The organic sales decline in EIG was driven in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas markets
29,"Although, our oil and gas organic sales were down in the quarter, the year-over-year decline has moderated as conditions stabilized"
30,We expect conditions to remain largely stable across our oil and gas businesses in 2017.
31,EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $162.6 million and operating margins were a very strong 26.4%
32,"The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $356.9 million, down 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2015 with organic sales roughly flat versus the prior year"
33,Acquisitions contributed 1% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind for the quarter
34,We are seeing improved organic growth trends and good order input for these businesses
35,EMG operating income in the fourth quarter was $63 million with operating margins of 17.7%
36,"In order to better align and reposition our cost structure to support sustained sales and earnings growth, we have taken realignment actions in the fourth quarter"
37,These realignment actions totaled approximately $25.6 million
38,We expect a strong payback on these actions with annualized savings of $37 million with an approximate $16 million benefit in 2017.
39,We also took a $13.9 million non-cash charge in the fourth quarter related to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles
40,"This was not a write-off of goodwill, but was driven by the weak global macro environment and its impact on the value of certain product line, trademark and trade names"
41,"Combined, the total charge taken in the fourth quarter was $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share"
42,"Now, let me touch on some of the highlights from our growth strategies"
43,"Our four growth strategies of strategic acquisitions, new product development, global market expansion, and operational excellence have been and will be the key drivers of our success"
44,They're well engrained in our business and culture
45,We view these growth strategies as critical to long-term success of AMETEK
46,"First, let me touch on acquisitions"
47,We are very excited with the acquisition of Rauland-Borg
48,It's a great start to 2017 as we acquired an outstanding company with a strong leadership position in an attractive niche market
49,I would like to welcome the Rauland-Borg team to the AMETEK family
50,"Rauland is a leading global provider of mission-critical clinical communications and workflow solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, and post-acute care facilities"
51,"In addition to their presence in the healthcare space, Rauland provides communication solutions to educational facilities"
52,They're a global leader with a premier brand name and a strong presence in their markets
53,"We expect continued strong growth for Rauland as the healthcare space continues its shift to value-based care and patient outcome improvement initiatives, both of which are key elements of Rauland-Borg's value proposition to their customers"
54,"We see attractive incremental growth opportunities by increasing its market share in international markets, expanding through additional acquisition opportunities and through leveraging our operational excellence capabilities"
55,Rauland was privately held with a distinguished 88-year history
56,"They're headquartered in Mount Prospect, Illinois"
57,Rauland has approximately $160 million in sales
58,The purchase price is $340 million plus a potential contingent payment of $30 million tied to achievement of certain milestones
59,This acquisition is an excellent example of our strategy to expand our footprint into attractive adjacent market segments
60,"Rauland provides us the opportunity to expand our medical technology exposure into a strong growth segment, while expanding our broad exposure to the medical market"
61,"With the acquisition of Rauland, the overall medical market exposure for AMETEK is roughly 13% of sales"
62,"Over the last 12 months, we have deployed approximately $730 million in capital on six acquisitions and we acquired approximately $300 million in sales"
63,We remain bullish on our acquisition pipeline and are excited to continue adding shareholder value through our proven acquisition capabilities
64,"Now, turning to new product development; we remain focused on investing in research, development and engineering in order to support the strong product and technology differentiation across our business"
65,"Additionally, we look to RD&E efforts as a key element in our organic growth initiative"
66,"In 2016, we spent roughly $200 million on RD&E or 5% of sales"
67,"In 2017, we expect to increase our investments in RD&E to approximately $215 million"
68,I'd like to highlight two of our recent new product introductions
69,"First, AMETEK Rotron recently introduced their SemiCool Precision Fans and Custom Cooling Systems for the high reliability cooling of semiconductor processes"
70,The SemiCool system offers precise temperature control in a compact package
71,"It was originally designed for critical military and aerospace applications, and has been expanded to serve critical semiconductor manufacturing processes"
72,"The system consists of compact, high reliability fans and optimized heat exchangers"
73,"It is designed to meet the needs of heat-intensive processes in the semiconductor production and is a departure from the tall industrial blowers, commonly used in semiconductor facilities"
74,The SemiCool system is compliant with semiconductor industry traceability and configuration control requirements
75,"AMETEK Programmable Power, a leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, introduced the new DC power supply for Sorensen family of DC power supplies"
76,The new Sorensen HPX series offers state-of-the-art features and technology in a smaller footprint than comparable DC power supplies
77,It delivers unsurpassed performance along with fast precise programmability
78,"AMETEK Programmable Power are used for the design, verification, testing, quality assurance and regulatory compliance of electrical and electronic products by customers in the computer, consumer electronics, industrial controls and aerospace and defense industries"
79,These are just two recent examples of the success of our research and development efforts
80,One way in which we measure the success of our RD&E efforts is through our vitality index
81,Our vitality index reflects the revenue from products introduced over the last three years
82,"In 2016, our vitality index was 24%, up slightly compared to 2015."
83,"Operational excellence continues to be an important driver of our success given its focus on cost and asset management, as well as its focus on process improvements impacting all areas of our business"
84,Our teams are making outstanding strides utilizing our expanded operational excellence tool kit to drive continued operating improvements in their businesses
85,"In 2016, we generated $130 million in our total operational excellence savings"
86,"Our operational excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, strategic procurement, value analysis, and value engineering, designed for Six Sigma and strategic cost effective manufacturing initiatives"
87,"Additionally, our activities include various tools that are focused on the frontend of our businesses to support improved organic growth"
88,"We are continuing to expand our average in this area across all of our businesses, which we believe will yield improved long-term organic growth"
89,Now turning to our outlook for 2017.
90,Market conditions are improved from this time last year
91,The most challenging markets from 2016 have stabilized
92,"We are realigning our cost structure, while continuing to invest appropriately in important growth areas"
93,Our operational capabilities and cash flow generation remain unquestioned and we continue to identify and close attractive acquisition opportunities
94,"Although we will be appropriately cautious as we start the year, we're excited to return to sales and earnings growth in 2017."
95,"As a result, we are anticipating overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2016."
96,Organic sales are expected to be up low-single digits from 2016.
97,"Earnings for 2017 are expected to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.46 per diluted share, up 2% to 7% over 2016."
98,"For the first quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be roughly flat, with organic sales down low-single digits"
99,"We are expecting first quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, flat to down 4% from 2016's first quarter"
100,"In summary, we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, and our business is stabilizing"
101,"We continued to aggressively manage our business for success in the short-term, while ensuring we are investing appropriately for the long-term"
102,Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy
103,"We have a talented and experienced management team, and we see tremendous opportunity to drive improved performance through the expansion of our operational excellence tools"
104,I am excited for the future of AMETEK and believe we are well-positioned to drive strong growth
105,"We asked a lot of our teams in 2016, and as usual, they stepped up and delivered"
106,I want to recognize the efforts of all our employees and thank them for their hard work
107,"I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year, and then, we'll be glad to take your questions"
108,The stabilization comment was really related to 2016.
109,And we had real weakness in our oil and gas and our metals business
110,"And as we spoke to in the last couple of quarters, we saw them stabilizing, and is charting out just as we had predicted"
111,"So, we're feeling, this time last year, we're feeling a lot of uncertainty about those two markets"
112,But we're feeling significantly different this year
113,"We're feeling more positive, because we think our footing is on a solid ground, and those businesses sequentially have stabilized"
114,We also feel good about the continuing organic orders growth in the business
115,"I mean, when you look at the organic orders, they've slowly improved each quarter throughout 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016 our organic orders were minus 1%, and our total orders was plus 1%"
116,So we're feeling really good about that also
117,So those are a couple of factors looking at orders and looking at our markets that make us feel much more positive going into 2017 than we were going into 2016.
118,We think we have a solid return for the deal
119,"We're very excited to acquire Rauland, as I mentioned"
120,The market has strong growth characteristics
121,It's a mid to high single-digit grower
122,It's a regulatory driven market
123,But it's also benefiting from some demographics in an aging population and a perpetual shortage of nurses
124,So they have some great demographics driving our business
125,There is high barriers to entry
126,There is high switching cost
127,Key driver is value based healthcare
128,"Rauland products help their customers reduce cost and improve nurse productivity and efficiency, that's the core product offering they have"
129,They're a leading provider of mission-critical communication systems
130,"Their product mix is about 80% hardware, 20% software"
131,Their primary product in healthcare is called the Responder series
132,It has extremely high market share in the United States in a good product cycle
133,It's really a good product cycle in terms of the new business and also the retrofit business they can win
134,They are a leader in the niche
135,"Their competition is companies like Ascom, but that's mainly international"
136,They are a strong leader in the U.S
137,"When we think about the company, we think we can help them grow internationally"
138,They have about 10% of their sales outside the U.S
139,and there is also some acquisitions that they wanted to acquire
140,"And being privately owned by a family, they really didn't want to have that risk tolerance"
141,So we think it's a great opportunity for AMETEK to fund the business to grow internationally and also look into additional acquisitions
142,"So, we did a lot of market work on the business and the market study that came back for this business has some of the highest scores that we ever saw on customer satisfaction"
143,So the people do a great job around our businesses and we think that we can add a lot of value to it and it will be a great deal for our shareholders
144,It's less profitable to AMETEK obviously
145,It will be a â€
146,“ a mid-teens EBIT kind of number would be a good number to look at
147,Sure
148,"Yeah, it really does"
149,There is a â€
150,"“ we expect 2017 sales will be flattish, but we think the upstream business will be up a little bit, and the mid and downstream businesses will be down slightly to flat"
151,So we expect a little bit of sales improvement throughout the year
152,"It's similar to when we went in for the oil and gas downturn, the upstream goes down first"
153,"While we are coming out of it, the upstream is starting to pick up"
154,"But we'll expect the midstream and downstream markets to improve later in the year, and maybe even next year"
155,So it will be flat to down slightly for mid and downstream and up for the upstream
156,"January came in, in line with what we thought and organic growth for Q1 is down low single digits"
157,"We're feeling better, but we're really calling a transition from negative organic growth to positive organic growth"
158,"So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, and we think the trend will improve for the year"
159,But Q1 is down low single digits
160,"Yeah, sure"
161,"EIG had a great quarter, and EMG was down a bit, and the EMG margins were driven by mix in our EMIP business"
162,That business has a little higher fixed cost than the average AMETEK
163,"So when the orders are lower, they are going to â€“ margins are going to drop a bit"
164,But the positive thing is we saw positive orders growth
165,"Actually, EMG orders turned positive in Q4, and when you look at sequentially from Q4 to Q3, we had 50% contribution on the incremental volume"
166,So we had a great quarter
167,"EIG did a little better, and EMG did a little worse"
168,"Yeah, great question, Dean"
169,"About 10% to 20% of the business was aftermarket, and the aftermarket is evolving because software is becoming a more important product offering for the business and software upgrades will increase that in the future"
170,The repeal of the ACA
171,", we did a lot of work on that"
172,and it really in the middle and long-term does not impact the value proposition of Rauland
173,They are strong demand drivers and minimum risk in the near-term
174,"The fundamental issue is that, they help nurses work more efficiently"
175,They're in a sweet spot of driving value-based healthcare and we got very comfortable with it
176,"However, we had the same concern, and we were concerned that the potential market uncertainly could cause some spending delays in the near-term, that the market pause with all the changes"
177,"So we expect it to be minimal, but to be prudent, we structured the deal as an earn out, tied to revenue levels within the first two years"
178,So we feel we acquired an excellent business
179,and we have protected â€
180,"“ we've added a degree of protection to our shareholders and we feel confident that we will earn our return on capital in both outcomes, either outcome"
181,"But we think we're going to pay the earn out, and we think that business is going to perform"
182,It's a couple of years and it's tied to revenue
183,The healthcare part was 90% and the education market is 10%
184,The education market is growing quite nicely
185,They have a new product called the Telecenter U
186,and it's really involved in mission-critical communication
187,"So, along with connecting classrooms and facilities across school districts, it also managed emergency communications for school districts, so it's seeing a good demand in the current environment"
188,"When we were in Q3, we had a bit of a ramp projected for Q4 and we talked about"
189,"we see some kind of year-end spending, little bit less than typical"
190,we expected it to occur and it occurred just like we thought
191,"So, there's a little bit of year-end money returning to more typical patterns, but not like it was a few years ago"
192,"Good morning, Andrew"
193,It really hasn't affected our business that much
194,"I mean, our acquisition pipeline is strong"
195,"We mentioned, with the Rauland deal, we had some additional market work to do there, but for most of our businesses, it seems that our pipeline work is going strong and there are ample people trying to sell the business, and ample buyers"
196,So the market is still running at elevated pricing
197,"It is still more money chasing deals, and we haven't seen any change in that in the last day since the election"
198,"About one-third is domestic, and two-thirds is international"
199,"It's distributed throughout the globe, but the Middle East is a strong area for us"
200,"Thanks, Andrew"
201,So you want me to go around the sub segments
202,I'll start with the aerospace
203,The overall sales for our aerospace business were down mid single-digits in the quarter
204,Fourth quarter results were similar to the full year of solid organic growth across our commercial business was more than offset by continued weak markets in business jet and regional jets
205,"Looking ahead to 2017, we expect our aerospace business to be up organically low single-digits to mid single-digits with growth across each of our aerospace segments"
206,"Our Process segment, organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by our oil and gas businesses"
207,", we talked about that"
208,"As expected, conditions stabilized in the quarter"
209,Our Ultra Precision Technology business had another very solid quarter to cap an excellent year with notably strong growth in both our Creaform and TMC Precitech businesses
210,We are encouraged with the stabilization we're seeing on the Process segment and expect this will continue into 2017.
211,"And for all of 2017, we expect organic sales for our process businesses to be up low single-digits with organic growth for our oil and gas businesses roughly flat"
212,"In our Power and Industrial segment, overall sales were up 10%, driven by the contribution of the Brookfield Engineering acquisition"
213,Organic sales were down mid single-digits in the quarter and in line with expectations
214,The weakness was largely a result of softness in the heavy truck market
215,"Switching to 2017, we expect organic sales for Power and Industrial to be roughly flat with modest growth in Power offset by weakness in our Industrial"
216,"In our differentiated EMG businesses, they were down low single-digits in the quarter, with weakness driven by our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses"
217,"As expected, conditions have stabilized across our EMIP businesses"
218,"And for 2017, we expect organic growth for all of differentiated EMG to be up low-single digits versus 2016, with our EMIP business expected to be flat"
219,"And finally, our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business, organic sales in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business were up 10% in the quarter and we expect sales for this business to be down low-single digits organically"
220,"So, to summarize, for the full year, we expect overall AMETEK sales to be up mid-single digits and for organic sales to be up low single digits"
221,"For EIG, we expect overall sales to be up mid-single digits and organic sales to be up low-single digits"
222,"And for EMG, we expect overall sales to be up low-single digits and organic sales to be up"
223,low-single digits
224,"So if you go back to the peak on oil and gas, there was about $400 million in revenue and entering 2017, it will be about $240 million in revenue, so we lost $160 million in revenue"
225,So it was down about 40% from the peak
226,"The upstream was down about 70%, and the midstream and downstream was down about 23%, 24%"
227,"And if you look at the EMIP business in metals, at the peak that business was about $500 million and we lost about 25% or $125 million, so that's about $375 million now going into 2017."
228,"As I said, we're expecting low to mid-single digit for our aerospace segment in 2017."
229,"When you think about the commercial market, we expect that to continue strong"
230,I think Boeing and Airbus are projected to increase build rates this year in the low-to-mid single-digit range and we have new additional content that we want on aircraft
231,So we expect to be up mid-single digits due to the ramp in new aircraft in the commercial area
232,"In regard to the third-party MRO business, we expect to be up mid-single digits, just grow solid growth as revenue passenger miles expand and we're well positioned in a couple of niche areas to grow our services"
233,"The military market, which is about 35% of our total aerospace exposure, we expect that to be up low-single digits in 2017."
234,"And in 2016, there was â€"
235,“ we had some â€
236,“ we were down mid-single digits and we expect that can be positive for us going up low-single digits in 2017.
237,"And in terms of the Bizjet market, that's a smaller part of our aerospace business"
238,"We expect modest sales growth off of a reduced sales level and the market we're expecting to be flat, but we do have some new program wins driving the growth"
239,"Hi, Rick"
240,I'll try to do that
241,"I mean, first of all, OpEx, we have about $100 million of OpEx working in the numbers"
242,"As I said before, we got some acquisition growth, about $0.03 or $0.04, total acquisition growth"
243,RD&E is up about 5% â€
244,“ 7% to $215 million
245,We do have some discrete incremental headwinds
246,FX will be about a point of sales and capital (41:56)
247,$0.03 is the headwind
248,Tax and interest will be about a $0.05 of headwind
249,The other thing is we have some incentive comp resets
250,"So we're down substantially off our targets, and (42:12) next year"
251,"When you think about pricing, we were about 1% in 2016."
252,"We think it will be a slightly better pricing environment at maybe 1.5% range, but inflation will also be slightly higher"
253,So we have price less inflation only slightly bother the 2016.
254,Our CapEx is budgeted to be $75 million
255,Cash flow will be 115% of net income
256,Our core operating margins for 2017 are expected to be up 20 basis point to 60 basis point
257,Yeah
258,Yeah
259,"The growth investments will be about $65 million on incremental sales, marketing and engineering"
260,"It was $130 million in 2016 and out of the blocks, we're saying it will be $100 million in 2017."
261,Yes
262,The EMIP business is about at the AMETEK average profitability
263,"And in terms of metals prices, I think it's a little bit of a mix for the key commodity trends for our business"
264,"â€“ for our business, vanadium is a key metal"
265,", that's plus"
266,30%
267,"Titanium sponge, molly, and nickel are flat to down and titanium scrap is down about 15%"
268,So it's a mixed environment for the metals that matter most to EMIP
269,We're being conservative calling that business
270,We talked extensively in some of our past meetings about where multiple levels removed from the end customer and inventory levels are difficult to estimate
271,"And we're seeing better buying patterns from customers, but there is still some inconsistency"
272,"So, we may be a bit conservative there, but we'd rather be that than aggressive on the projection"
273,"Hello, Bhupender"
274,"Yes, Bhupender, we can hear you"
275,Go ahead
276,It's a â€
277,"“ the history of the businesses is predominantly hardware, but software is becoming an increasingly important part of the future software offering"
278,"And as we try to extend the nurse call platform to multiple hospitals, you get an enterprise wide platform"
279,"and that's more software intensive, and that's a part of the business that's very attractive and growing"
280,"As I mentioned earlier, because it's a family-owned business, they ran the business exceptionally well"
281,"But they saw risk in acquisitions and international expansion, and only about 10% of the business is international"
282,And we think the market is about half international
283,So we think we can help them with that
284,and we think there is considerable runway to improve the business
285,"We had â€“ 52% of our sales were international in the quarter, and from my view, the two highlights in the quarter were; the U.S"
286,market was much stronger than prior quarters
287,And we were down about 10% for several quarters in a row in the U.S
288,and it was down only 2% organically
289,"And that was the strength in our process businesses really across the board, so the U.S"
290,"was improving and Asia was about flat organically, and China was up 5%"
291,So the fact that China was up 5% and the U.S
292,"was improving, we're encouraged by that"
293,"Europe was down, low mid single digits in line with recent trends"
294,"When you look at the BRIC countries in total, they were plus 1% organically in sales in Q4, again with China dominating that, India was flat"
295,"So, overall with the U.S"
296,"improving and with China now stabilized and starting to grow, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing geographically in our end markets"
297,I'll talk about the products in the healthcare space
298,The primary product is called the Responder series and it connects all the nurse call stations in a hospital
299,It's really an indispensable tool for nurses
300,It provides multiple levels of functionality
301,"It provides a virtual whiteboard status for each patient, so they know the patient status, a nurse at the nurse station can know the patient status for each patient"
302,"It provides voice communication between the nurse and patient and it also manages the patient and hospital alarm system, so the alarms in the hospital are controlled by the Rauland system"
303,"So it's a indispensable tool for hospitals and an indispensable tool for nurses, and as I mentioned earlier, it's a fantastic tool for hospitals to manage and efficiently utilize our nursing capability"
304,"As we know, there has been a perpetual shortage of nurses"
305,"So, they're right at the sweet spot of demographic trends, perpetual shortage of nurses"
306,"and there is a high degree of regulation in the market, the switching costs are very high"
307,So they're right from the product operating cycles and we're bringing new capabilities
308,So we feel really good about the product offering
309,"As I mentioned, the big competitor will be Ascom internationally, Hill-Rom also has some products in the market, but Rauland-Borg in the U.S"
310,is the market share leader by far
311,"It's about at the AMETEK average, it's 2% or less CapEx"
312,I think the trends that are â€
313,"“ we're working through a long cycle, and it's a predictable cycle, and past cycles have been very similar, although not as deep"
314,"And it's going to start with the upstream business picking up, and then it's going to flow through to the midstream and downstream, and will probably be a year or two years before the market totally gets returns"
315,"At the current price of oil, it's a lot lower than what it was, but it's enough for a positive business to take place"
316,Rig counts were up and that's key for our upstream business
317,"And what customers are telling us is, they actually have capital to spend this year"
318,Last year they really didn't
319,The authority to spend is back on the business units instead of the C-Suite
320,They were â€
321,“ all purchase orders had to go to the C-Suite before they'd buy anything
322,"And for our equipment there is some excess capacity out there, and it needs to be utilized"
323,"But we're seeing increased activity in the upstream space now, especially in the U.S"
324,", and for the midstream and downstream business, we think that's going to be flat to down a bit this year, but we're seeing some good project business in the Middle East"
325,So we're feeling much better this year than we were last year at this time
326,Okay
327,Thank you
328,"No, as I said before, our bread and butter acquisition is still the $50 million, $100 million, $150 million deal, and that's going to stay that way"
329,and we had tremendous value to those kind of businesses
330,But we've been successful in slightly larger deals
331,"So about 9 months ago we expanded our pipeline to include revenue size one notch higher, between $200 million to $500 million"
332,"And really we did that because as the business scales and we want to continue our track record of doubling the earnings for the company, we felt that we had to add those larger businesses to our candidate list and we also felt that we've been very successful doing a larger deal"
333,"I mean the bigger deals that we've done, we bought ZYGO"
334,"a couple of years ago, that business is performing extremely well for AMETEK"
335,"We bought Dunkermotoren a few years ago, the business is performing extremely well for AMETEK"
336,We've acquired Haydon Kerk
337,The business is performing extremely well
338,"So we're getting comfortable doing larger deals, but at the same time, we have not stopped doing the bread-and-butter deals"
339,"So we just think as we grow and we continue to generate more cash flow, we want to expand our opportunity set"
340,"Yes, I do"
341,strategic planning process about three months ago
342,We went into that in detail
343,and we're very comfortable with that
344,"Good morning, Chris"
345,Sure
346,"I mean, in situations with private companies who are looking to sell their business or looking for a credible seller that has the business model that's flexible enough to deal with the private company"
347,And AMETEK has shown that capability
348,We have the reputation of being able to do that
349,And I think Rauland approached a banker
350,"and they approached very few companies, because of the uniqueness of the situation, and we're lucky enough to work with the family and get the deal done, and now part of AMETEK"
351,So I think it's really the reputation of AMETEK and the work we're doing in the medical space that kind of in combined brought that business to AMETEK
352,"I mentioned earlier, we're calling a transition from negative organic growth to positive organic growth and in our business with the very high contribution margins, when you get positive organic growth, it's very accretive to profit"
353,"But, on the converse, when you have negative organic growth, it's difficult to call that turnover"
354,And we called low single digits for the first quarter
355,", we think that's the right call"
356,And we think that some markets talked about oil and gas are going to grow slowly throughout the year
357,We're going to see that continuing trend of slight improvement
358,"The benefits also, of course, the benefits of our realignment are a bit back-end loaded"
359,"We talked about the realignment and we talked about the benefits of $16 million, and those are going to more favorably impact Q3 and Q4 than Q1 and Q2."
360,"And as we've mentioned earlier, Rauland really impacts Q3 and Q4 more than Q1 and Q2 because of some of the acquisition accounting"
361,So those are the three things I'd point you to look at the â€
362,“ a little bit of a ramp in the earnings for the year
363,Yeah
364,"Hi, Allison"
365,AMETEK's strategy is to be in a bunch of diverse end-markets and we run businesses very effectively in a niche position
366,So even in the medical space that same limitation occurs
367,"So we don't have a fixed percentage, but any time a product or a market area gets 20% of the company, then we start to think about our diversification and â€"
368,“ but we still have room to go
369,and we're still active at looking at the medical space
370,"The one thing that I mentioned in my opening remarks was, we're getting a very good management team with Rauland"
371,Sales and marketing capability is outstanding
372,We spent time with the management team
373,We feel really good
374,It's going to be a good cultural fit
375,and we feel really good that we're going to bring what we do well to them
376,So feel really good about the future and the management capability with Rauland
377,"No, no"
378,I think you know our system
379,"I mean, it comes from the bottom up in terms of R&D and the business managers"
380,have to tell us what they want to work on and show us that it's a good project to fund and they'll get the funding
381,But the only thing is we really focused on taking our R&D dollars and spending it in the growth area
382,"So there is a little bit of that, but really it was the same process"
383,It's across all of our businesses
384,"It's a low risk approach, and as I mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products,"
385,so we think that's a healthy level
386,and we have really good engineering capability throughout the company
387,O
388,"We hear you now, Scott"
389,I don't think that's necessarily true
390,"I mean we talk about $65 million of growth investments, and we feel it's important to properly fund our sales and marketing expenses on our engineering, but we had a similar amount last year"
391,"So, I don't think there is a meaningful change in that area"
392,"We're going to make sure that we invest for the future, but it sits in line with the past"
393,"That's a great question, Scott"
394,"I mean, if you want to look at it at the overall level, I think there will be incrementally more spending in sales and marketing expenses, but the same amount of expenditures will be put back in each year"
395,"I mean we'll have healthy cost reductions offsetting the investments, but there are some opportunities in sales and marketing, and we're funding some of them this year"
396,So we think they're going to adequately return for AMETEK over the longer term or to benefit from them later this year
397,"That's a great question, Scott"
398,"I mean, one of our investments that we're making this year is an expansion in Southeast Asia"
399,So that's exactly what we're thinking
400,"We see some opportunities in our UPT business, our Ultra Precision Technology business, our Materials Analysis division in Southeast Asia, and one of the key investments that we're making is expansion in sales and marketing channels in that area"
401,Okay
402,It's both
403,"I mean, there are adjacent product areas in the non-acute care facilities"
404,There are adjacent product areas in the existing customer base and there are adjacent opportunities internationally
405,So we feel really good about all the avenues of growth
406,"Now, Rauland has some of these products under development, and some of the other product areas are more driven by acquisition than organic development"
407,"We did the market work and the existing SAM, the served addressable market was about $500 million and the TAM, the total addressable market, was about $1 billion"
408,"And we didn't include a lot of the TAM in our discussions, but those are the kind of â€"
409,"“ it's a niche market, it's a $500 million sort of market"
410,They don't participate much internationally and we feel good about the potential growth opportunities
