Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone
Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $193 million
Earnings per share rose by 7% to $1.56 a share
These results include Virgin America from December 14 through December 31, which added approximately $15 million to net profit in the fourth quarter and full year results
Our full year adjusted net profit was, as Lavanya said, $911 million and earnings per share rose 12% to $7.32. This marks the 13th consecutive year that we've reported an annual profit and the seventh year in a row that we've been profitable in every quarter, which shows the durability of the operating and financial model that we've created
We ended the year with after tax ROIC of 21.3%
Our acquisition of Virgin America adds about $3.5 billion to the invested capital base, bringing the total invested capital about $7.5 billion
As a result, the trailing 12 month ROIC, which uses the average invested capital base over the rolling 12 month period, will gradually fall throughout 2017 until we annualize the acquisition day
To illustrate, if you simply took Alaska and Virgin America's full year earnings for both companies, for 2016, and calculated ROIC using the $7.5 billion invested capital base, ROIC would be about 15%
We remain committed to producing returns that are well above our cost to capital
Our pre-tax profit for the quarter was $308 million, a $16 million improvement over prior year
Virgin America added $24 million of pre-tax profit, offset by an $8 million reduction in pre-tax for the pre-acquisition Air Group business
I might spend a minute wrapping up the final results for the pre-acquisition Air Group, excluding the impact of two weeks of Virgin
As Andrew said, we were pleased with our fourth quarter unit revenue results
On the costs side, CASM, excluding fuel, is about flat for the quarter, which was a bit better than our last Air Group guidance in early December before we closed the deal
Our fourth quarter economic fuel costs per gallon was actually up year-over-year, the first time that's happened since the first quarter of 2013. Looking at pre-acquisition Air Group for the full year, I was really happy to see full year CASMex decline by about 1%, and I want to thank everyone for their focus on keeping costs low by being highly productive and maintaining a frugal mind-set
Our long track record of slowly chipping away costs is a major driver of our strong results over the last several years, and as a source of competitive advantage over higher cost legacy carriers that will allow us to keep growing
I thought I might also share Virgin America's fourth quarter and full year results
For the fourth quarter, Virgin America recorded us on a standalone basis, pre-tax profit of $61 million, a 14% improvement over the fourth quarter of prior year
For the full year, Virgin America's standalone basis pre-tax profit was $244 million, a 14.7% pre-tax margin
I want to congratulate the team there on the really nice year-over-year improvement
Peter Hunt is here with us and would be happy to add more color to those results
Many have asked about our reporting going forward, we'll give guidance on an Air Group basis, of course, with some more limited guidance for our Mainline segment which is going to include Alaska and Virgin America
The year-over-year comps will be muddy for the next four quarters
To help investors understand what's really happening, we'll give guidance that has both a comparison between new Air Group and pre-acquisition Air Group, which will match our SEC reporting, but we'll also provide some color on what the changes represent had the business been combined on January 1, 2016, as Andrew illustrated with the capacity guidance
So let's turn the page to 2017. We expect consolidated CASMex to be about flat for the year on what would be an 8.5% increase in new capacity in the marketplace
This is on a combined basis, as I said, assuming a full year of Virgin America in the base
On the positive side, we're already seeing good progress on our cost synergy goals, and there is also other purchasing accounting adjustments that will favorably impact the P&L in 2017 by about $50 million
Those favorable items will help offset the cost pressure we're facing including the impact of a likely new engine services agreement at Alaska and an increase in engine overhauls and heavy checks on Virgin's fleet
We'll also have the impact of the new contract with our Alaska technicians, assuming it ratifies, and higher pension expense
As Brad said, we're making great investments to our onboard product
And finally, there's some ASM and cost headwinds associated with premium class, which does have a significant margin benefit, as Andrew said
Overall, I like where our cost structure stands and the results for 2017 given all that we have going on and the changes that are happening at other carriers
Turning to the balance sheet
We ended the year with $1.6 billion in cash
Total cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion excluding merger-related costs
This marks our fourth consecutive year of operating cash flows of about $1 billion or more
CapEx for the year was just under $680 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $820 million ex integration costs
We have a busy year with the fleet in 2017. At Alaska, we'll take delivery of 12 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft which are absolutely fabulous airplanes
Those will backfill the remaining 10 737-400s that will all be retired by year-end
We're also in the process of modifying three Boeing 737-700s into freighters, which will replace the five 737-400 combis and one 400 freighter that we currently operate
Say that 10 times quickly
In the regional business, we're looking forward to taking 18 E175s from Embraer
At Virgin America, we'll take some number of the A321neos Virgin was planning on, but we're working with the lessor on an arrangement where we don't take all 10 that are scheduled to be delivered over the next two years
Virgin America will be the worldwide launch customer for those aircraft, which will be configured with 185 seats, and we're very anxious to see how they perform
We're also planning more CapEx in non-aircraft related projects
For example, we're making a major investment into our facilities up in the state of Alaska, including a new hanger and significant remodels of several owned terminals
All in we're currently projecting 2017 CapEx to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion
During 2016, we returned $329 million to shareholders via $136 million in dividends and $193 million in share repurchases
I hope you saw today's announcement that we're again increasing the dividend by 9% to $0.30 per share per quarter
We've now increased the dividend four times since it was initiated, and it's increased threefold in that time
The increase signals our board's confidence in our plan and our ability to continue to generate strong results
We ended the year with $2.6 billion of long-term debt, with most of that being acquisition debt
Including the impact of leases, our year-end adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 59%
We're well positioned if interest rates rise as half our total debt is fixed
We remain committed to the idea of being not just a great airline, but a high quality business with a conservative balance sheet
In that vein, we're going to continue to re-deleverage until we hit our target of about 40% debt to cap
So I would expect cash distributions to shareholders to be limited to the dividend and perhaps some modest opportunistic share buybacks
Overall, I'm extremely pleased with where we are today
We closed the biggest acquisition in this company's history without using any equity, and did this while maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet
This is a testament to the financial discipline that's part of the DNA of this company, and it provides us with a strong foundation as we head into the future
And with that, let's open it up to questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Hey, Savi
I'll take the first, and then Mark can take the second on the fuel hedge strategy
In terms of the dividend, we've talked about this for several years now
We want to have a track record of increasing the dividend
That's something that high-quality industrials do, and we want to be considered that
As we looked, as you said, at our CapEx plan for the year, our cash flow plan for the year, the dividend made sense
And it's something that we're proud to announce, and as I said in my remarks, it shows confidence on the part of the board in our plan going forward
Mark, you want to take the fuel hedging?
$900 million-ish is – I don't remember if it's new, but if it is, great
I'm glad we were able to provide – I mean, it really does demonstrate the power of the networks
I don't have the revenue breakdown at my fingertips, but that will be in the 10-K
We disclosed what's in passenger revenue and in other revenue
In terms of the profitability of the program, that's probably a longer conversation that's not going to happen on an earnings call, but we can discuss that offline
What I will say is that just, it does wonders in terms of building customer loyalty and stickiness to Alaska/Virgin America, and that's, for us, where the power is
In terms of the profitability of each element, that's a little harder to get into
Joe, we're going to send you an application
Helane, Brandon
No, we have not thought about that at all
We wanted to do this acquisition in a way that wasn't dilutive, and we did it, and I think we still have a very strong balance sheet
So I don't feel the need to do that, at all
Yes, I think there's two questions in there
One is a buy versus lease question, and we've been a big advocate of buying for a lot of different reasons
In terms of where the airplanes fit best operationally, might get Ben to chime in on that because we're learning some things about that already
Eric, it's Brandon
Virgin America did run at a much lower margin than Alaska and mathematically, when you add the two together, you get a lower margin or a margin in between
In terms of where the business operates going forward, I think that's largely a matter of the economic environment, fuel conditions, competitive capacity, et cetera
I think Alaska's goal is to just be in a place where we're doing better than the industry on average
And I don't exactly know what that's going to be, but that's the goal
Yes, on a combined consolidated basis, so again assuming Virgin America had been in the base for the full year, CASM is going to be flat year-over-year
We have about $50 million or so of net good guy (50:37) in the base that resulted from purchase accounting, and there's a variety of things in there, some positive, some negative
And then the rest of it would be what I would call core growth including the impact of premium class, which takes out ASMs and adds some cost
But as I said in my prepared remarks, it's very accretive to the bottom line as well as the investments we're making in the onboard products
So some – I wouldn't call that inflationary growth
I would call that purposeful investment that we believe has a real payback and is good for guests
The deferred tax liability?
We actually carried over the ATL – well, I'm going to let Chris Berry answer this
It's an accounting question
Hi, Andrew
On the second question, I didn't quite follow it
Are you talking about non-fuel CASM or fuel CASM?
For that flying – I mean, those are great airplanes
But for that flying, that actually is a reduction in terms of ASMs per gallon, just because the smaller gauge of those aircraft
Where you're really seeing the benefit is the exit of the 737-400s and replacement of the 900ERs, 37 more seats
Basically, they burn the same amount of fuel
It's a nice, nice, nice tailwind in terms of fuel efficiency
On the cost side – I forgot your question
Yes
I mean, we're – I'm not going to tell you exactly the number, but I will tell you that we're really pleased with the pace that we're going on realizing those cost synergies
There is the obvious stuff baked in: head count reductions, including the executive compensation that was in the base last year
But it's not just that; it's synergies that we've already realized in lots of different areas, and we'll give you more color on that at Investor Day
We're well on our way
I'm going to let Shane Tackett answer that question
