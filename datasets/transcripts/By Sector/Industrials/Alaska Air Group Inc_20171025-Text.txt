Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone
As you've now heard, Air Group posted a $278 million third quarter adjusted profit, a $6 million increase over last year's adjusted Q3 result
This equates to a pre-tax profit of $446 million and a trailing twelve pre-tax margin of 20%
On a combined comparative basis, that is with Virgin America's third quarter of 2016 in the base, our result was $68 million or 13% lower than last year
Andrew covered revenues, so I'll cover costs
Fuel costs were up substantially or $70 million, which equates to 23%, and non-fuel cost rose by $97 million
Unit costs ex fuel were up 1% on 7% ASM growth
Operational disruptions resulted in about $6 million of incremental cost during the quarter with airports and call centers most heavily impacted
Our call center team has worked extremely hard over the last few months, and our employees there deserve a huge shout-out
Not only did they handle the added volume from the disruptions, more guests are calling with questions about integration-related changes to our network and loyalty programs
The Q3 impact of those costs was partially offset by a shift in timing of some of the maintenance now planned for Q4. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect unit costs to be up about 1.5% on the 11% increase in capacity
While that certainly doesn't make for a very impressive headline, there are several drivers
First, we're pleased to announce that we finally signed a new engine services deal with GE that covers all 130 of our Boeing 737-800 engines
We're very pleased with the economics of this deal
A power-by-the-hour structure will help take the lumpiness out of the engine overhaul expense over the next nine years compared to a time and materials approach, but it does result in near-term CASM impact, which begins in Q4 and will impact 2018. Second, as I mentioned, we do have some maintenance activities planned in Q4 that were deferred from Q3, and we're also planning more advertising and promotional activity in the fourth quarter in support of our transition to one single Alaska brand
And finally, the close-in capacity reductions on the regional side will also impact unit costs because the fixed cost gets spread over fewer ASMs. In fact, our full-year 2017 capacity will now be up 7.2%, down from the 7.5% we guided to as recently as mid-September and way down from the guidance as high as 8.5% at one point during the year
We are deep into the budget process now and expect to provide 2018 cost guidance in January
Our financial planning team and divisional leaders are digging into their businesses and together will be setting aggressive budgets
Although the budget is still in process, I thought I might call out a few significant items
First, the result of our mainline pilot arbitration
As we reported previously, the annual impact of the company proposal is $140 million, which we believe puts our pilots' total compensation in a very competitive position versus others in the industry, especially considering our relative size and our growth-oriented business
At the $140 million level, it would result in a nearly 3 point increase in CASMex and will reduce pre-tax margins by more than 1.5 points
We expect the arbitrator award soon and for the decision to impact Q4, which is not included in the Q4 cost guide
The new engine services deal, this will add about $30 million of incremental expense over what we might have been expected to incur on a time and material basis
But again, this is about timing
The economics over the nine years are significantly better
Third, the growing mix of regional flying, which will be up nearly 25% next year given all of the E175 adds, this will pressure CASM but also help RASM
And finally, continued what I call integration friction, in other words, costs that don't get captured in the merger-related cost line on our external P&L but are real
This friction should start to decline right after we get through the PSS transition
Our job as leaders will be to ensure that we eliminate these costs as quickly as possible, and we don't let things like consultant and contractor cost get buried into the baseline or change our way of thinking and how we get things done around here
Bottom line, our costs will rise in 2018, but we understand the importance of low cost to the business model and to the success of the company
We have a long track record of solid cost control, and I'm confident we can continue to maintain a cost structure that gives us significant competitive advantage over the legacy carriers
Our cash flow continues to be strong
We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we've now generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow excluding merger-related expenses since the start of the year
CapEx for the first nine months of the year stands at just under $850 million, resulting in more than $600 million of free cash flow, again ex merger-related expenses
We now expect full-year 2017 CapEx to be $1.1 billion and 2018 CapEx to be $1.4 billion
Horizon's deferral of five E175s from late 2017 and early 2018 to the back half of 2018 explains the timing shift
Total 2017 and 2018 CapEx is basically unchanged
Our fleet continues to get younger as we've now retired nearly all of the Boeing 737-400s
Through September 30, we've taken delivery of 10 Boeing 737-900ERs, two Airbus A321neos and 10 E175s
Meanwhile, our portfolio of unencumbered aircraft continues to grow and is now at 63 aircraft or more than 20% of the fleet
We're also making steady progress re-deleveraging our balance sheet
Our debt-to-cap fell by another 2 points this quarter to 53%, and we expect to end the year at about the same level
Less than a year since we completed the acquisition of Virgin America, we've lowered our debt-to-cap by 6 points and are well on our way of achieving our longer-term target in the low to mid-40s range
Although funding growth and deleveraging remain our primary capital allocation goals, balance remains important
In that vein, we repurchased an additional 350,000 shares of stock last quarter
We've now completed our plan to repurchase $50 million worth of our shares in 2017. We've also paid $111 million in dividends so far this year
In sum, this is a very solid quarter for us during what is and what will continue to be a transitional period
There's a lot of work ahead to get through the significant integration milestones so that we can begin to truly be one airline and fully realize the synergies we expect to achieve, which are, by the way, on target
Andrew described a somewhat challenging fare but not demand environment that is pressuring revenues, and I covered some near-term cost pressures that we'll be dealing with
However, we remain very optimistic about what we're building and the opportunity ahead
And with that, let's go to your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
As I mentioned, we're still in the budget process, so it's too early to say for sure
What I would say is that I gave you a bunch of the pieces
The pilots are going to be probably 3 points of CASM
We do have other cost pressures that are just – they are just these are the realities – the reality of the business are like the maintenance deal, really good economics but where the expense impact is different than what I'd call the cash impact
And then there's the mix issue
We do have this friction that I've been talking about and that's real
That will be in the first half of the year
As I said, it will start to come out in the second half of the year
So, it's probably a fair assessment to say flattish, perhaps up modestly ex pilot, but again, in terms of a specific quantification, really hard to do because I don't know the size of the pilot arbitration decision, and I don't know when it starts, so it's hard to give you a percentage year-over-year change
This is the answer that again, demand is solid, but we're seeing some close-in pricing that is puzzling to us
Mike, good morning
It's Brandon
Well, I hadn't really focused on the fact that we had a free cash deficit
Just off the top of my head, it's probably a pullback in the ATL (35:48) just as we get through the summer of flying
It's probably the timing of pre-delivery payments on the deliveries, and that's probably it
There was nothing significant that jumped out (36:01) during the quarter that would result in a free cash deficit other than, like you say, just the normal seasonality combined just with the timing of capital expenses
For the year, our free cash flow will be very solid though, just to point out
Hi, Hunter
It's Brandon
Maybe I'll disclose – I can assure you that we are more frustrated than you about this whole thing
And there's a lot of anxiety around here
There's been a lot of tough conversations in the last few weeks about this
We've already started talking about this notion of a glide slope to get from the place we are now to the place we want to be
And
Good morning, Joe
No, it's not a matter of renegotiation at all
We're actually satisfied with our contract with BofA right now
It's a long-term deal
So, we have no plans to go out right now and to renegotiate that deal
Although I will say BofA has been very helpful, and we expect them to continue to be helpful providing incentives for us to attract members to the Alaska Airlines credit card
We do have a process going right now to get people from the Virgin America card over to the Alaska card
But it's more than just conversion
It is growing that credit card presence in California
We gave you some information in Investor Day that even with small penetration, the economics are going to be powerful
I'm not going to give you any quote earnings or EPS number in terms of what that means, but what we will say is that the credit card, as you well know, is a strong driver of cash flow and an economic engine in this company, and we would continue to see that as being an opportunity as we grow the base
