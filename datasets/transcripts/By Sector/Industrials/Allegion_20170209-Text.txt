Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone
Thank you for joining the call this morning
Please go to Slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year
I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides
As indicated, we delivered 5.2% and 5.8% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively
The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives
Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impacts of rising commodity prices
Foreign currency was a headwind in the quarter, particularly in the EMEIA region
During the quarter, divestitures were a slight headwind, which offset the impact of acquisitions
For the year, all three regions were favorable on price and saw headwinds from foreign currencies
Acquisitions more than offset the impact of divestitures
Please go to slide number eight
Reported net revenues for the quarter were $569.7 million
This reflects an increase of 4.4% versus the prior year, up 5.2% on an organic basis
I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic revenue growth from Americas, which had strong growth in both the non-residential and residential businesses off a tough comparison from the prior year
We continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel strategies
We had improved pricing in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwinds seen in EMEIA
In the fourth quarter, we lapped the large acquisitions completed during 2015. As such, during the quarter, the incremental contribution from acquisitions was offset by the impact of the divestiture of the system integration business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income of $102 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.9% declined 1.4% and 110 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year
Included in these numbers is the environmental remediation charge of $15 million, which had a 260 basis point impact on the adjusted operating margin in the quarter
Excluding the environmental charge, the underlying operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage and continued progress on our EMEIA margin transformation
During the quarter, price and productivity more than offset the impacts of inflation and incremental investments
Our EBITDA margin of 20.5% was a 110 basis point decline versus the prior year but, similar to adjusted operating margin mentioned earlier, includes the 260 basis point impact of the environmental remediation charge
Excluding the charge, all regions improved during the quarter
The business continues to execute at a high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth
Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter
For the fourth quarter 2015, reported EPS was $0.74. Adjusting $0.15 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs, related acquisitions and divestitures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.89. Operational results increased EPS by $0.16, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts
As noted previously, the environmental remediation charge drove a $0.10 reduction
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.07 reduction
This was driven primarily by the positive impact from the sale of non-strategic marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2015 that did not repeat in Q4 of 2016. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.03 per share reduction versus the prior year
The increase in rate is primarily due to unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reductions in certain countries' statutory tax rates
The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2016 was lower than anticipated due to favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions and changes in certain countries' statutory tax rates
Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies were a $0.03 reduction
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, subtracted $0.01 in the quarter
This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2016 EPS of $0.81 per share
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges
After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.77. Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $410 million, up 7% on both a reported and organic basis
Strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new products and channel initiatives
As noted on the chart, we experienced solid, high-single digit growth in the non-residential products driven by strength in our premium brands and mid-single digit growth in residential products, with solid performance in both our retail and builder channels
Revenue growth was strong across most product categories with continued momentum in electronics
Americas' adjusted operating income of $96.7 million declined slightly versus the prior-year period as a result of the $15 million environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier
Excluding the charge, operationally, Americas' adjusted operating income increased due to incremental volume leverage, favorable mix and positive impact from foreign currency
Overall, price and productivity offset inflation and incremental investments
Pricing realization improved sequentially in the quarter with good performance in both commercial and residential markets
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 260 basis points, driven by the 370 basis point impact from the environmental charge
The operational increase, while absorbing the incremental investment spend, demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team
Please go to slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $129.4 million, up 0.2%, or up 1.4% on an organic basis
The reported revenue growth was driven by the impact of the organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds
In particular, the portable security and SimonsVoss businesses saw solid growth
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $19.9 million increased 13.1% versus the prior-year period
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation, more than offsetting currency headwinds
Although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 9.3%
At the time of the spin-off, adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%
This is a significant improvement in operational results driven by an extremely dedicated EMEIA team
Please go to Slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $30.3 million, down 8.5% versus the prior year
Organic revenue declined 0.7% and was impacted by the timing of orders and large non-recurring projects in 2015. Total revenue declines are attributable to the divestiture of the system integration business in 2015. Our Australia and New Zealand markets continued to be strong along with Southeast Asia
Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.3 million was up 4.5%
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 100 basis points, reflecting favorability in price and productivity along with the impacts of divesting the system integration business
Please go to Slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2016 was $335 million, an increase of $112.8 million or 50.8% compared to the prior-year period
The increase in year-over-year available cash flow is primarily attributable to higher net earnings
Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements
As discussed later in the presentation, we made a $50 million discretionary contribution to our U.S
pension plan in January 2017. This contribution significantly improved the plan's funded status, while also reducing future cash payments to the plan and reducing anticipated increases in pension expense for future years
This outflow is included in the guidance of available cash flow for 2017. Please go to Slide number 14. Since the spin, we stated our capital allocation strategy is one that defines a balanced and flexible approach, which remains a primary focus today
We ended the year with a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9 times, in the middle of our targeted range of 2.75 times to 3.25 times
If you recall, we ended 2015 with a 3.5 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA
This reduction reflects growth in EBITDA during the year, as well as mandatory principal payments made on our secured credit facility
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ended the year at 2.3 times
As Dave will discuss later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments for channel strategies, new product development and demand creation to accelerate core market expansion
Supported by our 2016 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to continue to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market as well as provide superior returns on invested capital
We also remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions
We plan to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available for potential M&A opportunities
While we did not close as many transactions during 2016 as we did in 2015, the M&A pipeline remains active, as evidenced by the recent announcement of our acquisition of Republic Doors
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflects strength and confidence in our cash flow
In addition, we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate
Last week, we announced a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend and also announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased 850,000 shares for approximately $55 million under our previous share repurchase authorization
In summary, we have many options to deploy capital for the benefit of our shareholders
This is driven by our ability to generate consistent, high cash flow
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2017 guidance
So, as you mentioned, Q4 pricing was favorable
If you kind of look at it, relative to the prior quarter, it sequentially improved
We did go out with a price increase at the beginning of the quarter, and our commercial segment of the business saw really good traction there
I think it demonstrates that we've continued to grow in our discipline and focus in this area
Saw good improvement in the residential business as well, which was really positive
We believe that momentum will continue into 2017. And so, the price-cost equation, as we look into kind of the full year basis of where commodity prices trade today, most of the price should offset the commodity headwind
It is a significant, kind of, change if you look at the cost side of the equation
Commodity prices, like steel for example, is up 40%, 50% over the average rate for 2016. So, we are anticipating more price movement in 2017 to offset the increase in the commodity costs
So, in Q4, it was about 150 basis points improvement year-over-year
As we look in kind of the full year, 2016 I think across the globe was about 1% price improvement, which is fairly consistent over the prior couple of years
2017 will be north of that
You're probably looking at 1% to 1.5% improvement
So, the rest of the organic growth would be volume related and we would characterize that as growing at market plus
We would expect, given our channel initiatives, new product development, the traction we've gained, some of the new initiatives, new products coming out for 2017, that we would grow above market of, say, 1% to 2% is our expectation
And that's why you're seeing a fairly robust anticipation of revenue growth for 2017, as well as strong markets
You bet
I would just add, too, Andrew, if you kind of look at these in terms of capital deployment alternatives, you have to look at it over a longer time horizon
And these, historically, over the last couple of years, have provided an outstanding return on invested capital
And so, we kind of – we look at the opportunities
As Dave said, we're a learning organization, as we look at opportunities to expand our market segmentation, and areas where we're underserved today just provides really good growth opportunities
And we're going to manage the equation so that the incremental investments, we can make those, still grow the top line and expand our margins in the region where we make the investments
Yeah
From a seasonal perspective, I think you probably have to look at – go back to 2015 and look at kind of the split there from top line perspective
It may be back into, kind of, the first half of 2016 and assume kind of revenue growth and margin expansion in both quarters year-over-year
But you're right, the comparisons were easier in Q1 just because of the blip we had last year
So, we'll continue to see margin expansion
The pricing is going to be stronger
As you said, that should offset a lot of the commodity cost increase
We continue to get outstanding volume leverage on the incremental volume
And so, that should continue to move forward
Productivity improvements will continue to drive margin performance as well
So, the margin expectation is, we'll manage the incremental investments to ensure that we get top line growth
So, we're still getting margin accretion in Americas and that should be fairly steady throughout the course of the year
So, we didn't mention it in the quarter
Well, for the full year, kind of, low-double digits growth
Q4 was kind of similar type of range
It continues to grow faster than the traditional mechanical business
A good trend for us
As you know, electronic products sell at a higher average selling price, similar margin, more EBIT dollars, cash flow
So, good trend, and that's something we're investing in to take advantage of that electromechanical convergence
Yes
So, I would anticipate – well, first of all, the step-up here is all related to specific opportunities that we see specific around the market segmentation that Dave talked about, expansion of the channel, discretionary market opportunity, new product development, those type of things
The other thing that's fueling that a little bit is, when we acquire companies, I mean, there's opportunities that, in order to fully realize that investment and take advantage of that, investments are needed to kind of expand the capabilities of that
Republic Door would be a good example of that, where we need some infrastructure spending, if you will, to fully take advantage of that acquisition and to fill out the regional distribution capabilities for fulfillment for customers
So, really, it's going to be dependent upon what's taking place in the industry, acquisitions, et cetera
But I would say, going forward, long term, $0.15 to $0.20 I would say is probably a peak
How much it will taper down from there is hard to say
But each year, we'll kind of look at it individually
But I think the critical thing is that, when we evaluate these, we ensure that there's good revenue growth opportunity that we can execute on it, the risk of doing that isn't significant and it's – we got to demonstrate a proof-of-concept in the marketplace before we put a bunch of capital behind it
So, we've got levers we can pull
If we can't execute, we can swaddle back a little bit
A little bit more difficult, just given the scale and size of the region
But steady improvement, kind of, like where we are now with Europe
We'd expect to leverage on top line growth and continue to drive price to exceed inflation and just steady improvement
