1,"Everyone, today, we'll handle this call much like we have the past few"
2,"We'll be walking through a short slide deck, and then we'll move on to Q&A"
3,"And if you don't have that slide deck in front of you at the moment, it's available at our caterpillar"

7,"If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar"
8,com website and
9,it will be in a section labeled results webcast
10,"So if you go to page 2 of the slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements"
11,"And this morning for sure we are going to be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information"
12,"In addition to page 2 of the slide deck, there is a discussion of some of the factors that individually, or in the aggregate, could make our actual results to differ materially from our projections, and that can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1A, risk factors of our Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release"
13,"In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both our financial release and this presentation, which can be found in today's earnings release"
14,"And again, that's also posted on our caterpillar"
15,com website
16,"So, with that, let's get into the quarter and turn to page 4 of our slide deck for today"
17,And that's the high-level summary of fourth quarter sales and profit
18,So sales and revenues for the quarter were about $9.6 billion and that's down about 13% from the fourth quarter of 2015 which was just a little over $11 billion
19,"Now, we lost $2 per share in the fourth quarter this year versus $0.16 a share last year in the fourth quarter and if you"
20,â€
21,"“ if you look at the primary drivers of profit, big contributors to that were the mark-to-market adjustment that we made for the pension liability, we impaired $595 million worth of goodwill, and on that particular topic, there's a Q&A in the release"
22,"I think it's the first Q&A, and I think that does a pretty good job of talking through those adjustments"
23,"In addition to that, we have a valuation allowance on deferred taxes"
24,That was unfavorable
25,"And those three items, plus restructuring costs are the items that we're adjusting out between profit per share and adjusted profit per share"
26,And adjusted profit per share coincidentally year-over-year was flat at $0.83 per share
27,And that's â€“ to Jim's point earlier
28,", I think that's pretty good performance"
29,"On a 13% decline in sales, our adjusted profit was flat"
30,And that's because we had a lot of cost reduction in the quarter
31,just like we had a lot of cost reduction in the year
32,"Period and variable costs, and we'll talk about this in a minute, a little bit more, were favorable just under $0.5 billion"
33,So that was good performance
34,Let's move on to page 5.
35,It's a little more discussion about the sales change
36,"So Energy & Transportation, which by sales is the largest segment, dropped about $695 million in sales and about half of that was Transportation, and that is rail and marine"
37,Oil and Gas was down a little and power gen was down a little as well
38,Power gen has been weak in particular in the Middle East
39,"Resource Industries, down $435 million from just under $1.9 billion to a little over $1.4 billion for the quarter"
40,and that's all new equipment
41,"So aftermarket was actually up for the third quarter in a row sequentially, and it was actually up a little bit year-over-year"
42,"So fourth quarter was a little higher than the fourth quarter of last year, and that's a good signal"
43,Price realization on the other hand was negative $62 million in the quarter
44,"If we go down to Construction, Construction sales were about $300 million lower, and most of that is in North America and Europe, Africa, Middle East"
45,"Actually Asia-Pacific was up quarter over quarter, and a lot of that came from strength in China that we've seen so far this year"
46,"So, again, in total, we were down about $1.456 billion quarter over quarter"
47,"If we move on to page 6, this is a waterfall chart that sort of reconciles, I guess, operating loss in the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year, and it's everything, all in"
48,So a big negative was $463 million and that's on that $1.4 billion decline in sales
49,"Price realization, which has been fairly significantly negative most of the year moderated quarter over quarter in this quarter"
50,"It was negative $80 million, and most of that was, as I mentioned on the prior page, Resource Industries"
51,"Cost reduction variable $91 million; period, $401 million"
52,So that's good
53,That's a continuation
54,"And I would mention that we had more incentive compensation in 2015 than we did 2016, but in the fourth quarter, it wasn't a factor"
55,We had very little in both fourth quarters
56,So this $492 million all but was not affected hardly at all by the short-term incentive pay
57,Currency was pretty neutral
58,Financial Products was down a bit
59,They had less gains on the sale of securities in their insurance business
60,"There was a little bit more loss, and that's a result of, I think, lower used equipment prices on repossessed and returned equipment"
61,"And their volume was lower, the earning assets were down"
62,And that's â€
63,“ in some ways it's a progression of what's happened to our sales over the last few years
64,"Our sales are down, so the amount of what they're financing is down a bit as well"
65,Restructuring costs in the quarter were quite a bit less than the fourth quarter of 2015.
66,And I'm going to talk a little bit more about restructuring costs here in a minute
67,Then we have a couple of big negatives
68,"Mark-to-market losses, that's essentially the present value of the future liability of our pension and benefit plans"
69,"It was a loss of $985 million this year versus $214 million a year ago, and that's essentially because interest rates on high-quality, long-term bonds declined slightly in the year"
70,"Goodwill impairment was $595 million, and that was in our Surface Mining & Technology business"
71,We impaired about half of the goodwill in their business
72,"And on the final other line we had legal charges in the fourth quarter of last year that we didn't have this year, and that's most of that difference"
73,So that's a bit of a walk through operating profit
74,Let's turn to page 7.
75,Let's make a few comments about the full year
76,Sales were down from â€“ and revenues â€“ from $47 billion to about $38.5 billion
77,That's an 18% drop
78,"Profit per share in 2015 was $4.18, and again this year it was a loss of $0.11."
79,"If you take out items that we're adjusting for, and again that's the mark-to-market, the goodwill, restructuring costs, and the tax impairment, we were at $3.42."
80,And that's a little bit better than our final outlook of the year that we gave at the end of the third quarter
81,That was $3.25.
82,We ended up at $3.42.
83,So that's good
84,"Again, the drivers of the adjusted profit change on the bottom right are very similar to what happened in the quarter"
85,"We had lower sales volume but a lot of cost reduction that offset that, or at least offset a part of it, about half in fact"
86,So that's a little on the full year
87,Let's move to page 8 and talk a little more about cost reduction
88,"I mentioned this earlier, but we had $492 million in the fourth quarter"
89,"For the year, it was over $2.3 billion of lower costs"
90,"And if you go down to the bottom, the three little boxes that start on the right, there was a piece of that that is related to short-term incentive compensation, and there's a Q&A in the back of the release that has all the numbers for the quarter and the year for that"
91,But a little over $300 million of that $2.3 billion was incentive compensation lower
92,"If you move into the middle, we had good material cost reduction again for the year, and it's a combination of commodity-related prices versus 2015 and then, as always, even without commodities, we do a lot of work every year on sourcing and design to lower costs, and that was a positive"
93,"And then on the most significant item on the left, our restructuring, and that is reducing people, reducing floor space, consolidating functions and facilities, and we've done quite a lot of that"
94,"In fact, if you turn to page 9 here, we'll cover restructuring â€"
95,“ the big restructuring that we announced a little over a year ago
96,I thought this might be a good kind of recap on what's happened
97,"On September 24 of 2015, we had a big press release that covered a number of fairly significant actions that we were planning to take"
98,"And in that release, we said we were going to close or consolidate about 20 facilities, which would reduce manufacturing floor space by about 10% and take about 10,000 people out of our workforce"
99,"We said that it would cost about $2 billion to do that, about $1.6 billion of it cash and about $400 million noncash, which would have been primarily asset-related expenses"
100,"And we also said when it was fully implemented, we would save about $1.5 billion annually going forward, and we thought that would take a few years to complete"
101,"So if we go on to page 10, let's kind of talk through a little bit what's happened"
102,"And I realize there are a lot of words on this page, but we've either completed or announced or are in the process of implementing virtually everything that was in our press release from the third quarter of 2015"
103,and then some
104,That's involved the consolidation and closure of â€“ actually ended up more than 30 facilities and about 14% of floor space
105,"We said we were looking to take down the workforce by about 10,000."
106,"It's actually declined about 16,000 from the end of the third quarter of 2015."
107,"Now, restructuring costs in 2015 and 2016 have been about $1.9 billion, and our outlook today anticipates an additional $500 million in 2017."
108,"Now, if you add that up, that's a bit more than what we said in that release, and that's because a little of it was actually for programs that predated that announcement"
109,"And since then, we've actually done more"
110,"Just as an example, we announced the shutdown of our on-highway truck business earlier in 2016, and that was not something we had previously anticipated"
111,So costs are a little bit more than we had talked about that September
112,"The flip side of that, though, is savings appear to be quite higher"
113,"So if you take out short-term incentive comp, that's really not cost reduction related to any of the actions that we've taken, and so it's not fair to count the benefit of that"
114,"So if you take that out, at the end of 2016, we had taken out about $1.5 billion from our period cost structure since 2014."
115,"And we â€“ to go to the next page, page 11, we're expecting more reduction in our cost structure, again, not including inflation and short-term incentive of about another $500 million this year"
116,"So that means by the time we get to the end of 2017, we'll be looking for our period cost structure to be down a couple billion dollars, which is a bit more than we said in the third quarter of 2015, and that's because we're doing more than we anticipated then"
117,"Now, all those numbers both on the cost side and the estimated benefit side, they do not include two large facilities that we're currently contemplating"
118,"We've announced both of these: Gosselies, Belgium; and Aurora, Illinois"
119,"If those two actions end up moving forward, they would add both to restructuring costs and potential benefits"
120,So that's a recap on restructuring
121,"Actually, quite a bit of progress there"
122,"So if we move on to page 12, just a few points on the outlook, and Jim touched on this earlier"
123,Our outlook for next year has sales in a range of $36 billion to $39 billion
124,The midpoint of that is about a $1 billion lower than 2016.
125,We are actually seeing a number of positive signals
126,"Commodity prices over the course of the past year have risen, and that's good"
127,"If we get any continued improvement and any stabilization, I think that's important"
128,That would be a positive for several of our businesses
129,"In particular, gas compression has remained very strong"
130,Solar had another good year this year and they have a strong backlog as we start 2017.
131,"Construction in China has been positive, and that's good"
132,"But that said, it's dependent upon continued economic growth and government support for construction in China as we go into 2017."
133,"And then, Construction â€"
134,"“ this might sound a little backwards, but Construction sales in other developing countries like Brazil, for example, are at extremely low levels"
135,"Brazil, in particular, it's way off where we were a couple of years ago"
136,"They've been involved in a pretty deep recession there, and with any kind of recovery, there certainly would be upside there"
137,"Now, in terms of concerns, and we talked about these in the release, mining customers, our estimates and what we've read, we're not seeing â€"
138,"“ we're seeing better sentiment, for sure, but we're not seeing expectations for a big increase in CapEx in 2017, although it does look like that could occur in 2018."
139,We've had weakness in North American construction over the past year
140,There's been a lot of used equipment in the market
141,The slide in oil and gas over the last couple of years has been a negative for our sales
142,Economic growth in Europe
143,", it's actually been not too bad"
144,"Our sales in Europe over the last year or so have been okay, but Brexit is still a risk"
145,"It's not happened yet, and so I think we have to count that as a concern"
146,"And then for next year, it looks to us like rail, marine, power gen and industrial engine sales are going to be down"
147,So that's all just a little summarization of the sales outlook
148,"The profit outlook for next year is $2.30 all-in including restructuring, and about $2.90 at an adjusted level"
149,"And the only thing that's being adjusted out of that is restructuring costs, and those would be at the midpoint of the sales and revenues outlook"
150,"So let's move on to 13, which is our last page"
151,and then we'll jump into the Q&A
152,Our 2007 (sic) [2017]
153,outlook
154,we think is pretty consistent with what we said in early December
155,"We â€“ at that point, we made a statement that said that the $38 billion outlook that was in consensus we thought was pretty reasonable"
156,"Since then, we've had a bit of currency movement, and so there's a bit of translation on sales that have caused us to peg the outlook at $37.5 billion"
157,But that's not a result of any change in any of the underlying fundamentals the way we see the marketplace
158,"We've had good operational performance, and we've talked about this quite a bit already, in particular, on cost reduction"
159,"We're on track with our restructuring actions, and we maintain a pretty strong balance sheet"
160,Our debt-to-cap ratio is within our targeted range for ME&T of 41%
161,"We generated good positive ME&T operating cash flow in 2016, which was more than enough to cover the dividend and CapEx, and we would expect that to continue in 2017."
162,"And we ended the year with a cash balance over $7 billion,"
163,so that's good as well
164,"So with that, Kate, we're ready to open the line for Q&A"
165,Question-and-Answer Session
166,Yes
167,"First off, the decline is not very much, it's $1 billion"
168,"Roughly half of that is currency translation related, not an industry or volume decline"
169,And of what's left probably the most significant decline is in Energy & Transportation
170,"Again, it's not a lot, but like on my last slide I talked about Transportation being weaker"
171,So we see a bit of a decline in rail and marine
172,"Power gen, particularly in the Mideast has been tough and industrial engines down a little bit for Ag and loose engines"
173,we sell to gen set packagers
174,So probably of the piece that's not currency translation is probably a little heavier E&T
175,"Construction, we would see as relatively flat, and our Resource Industries, I think the mining part of it should be pretty close to flat"
176,And we're still a little pessimistic on large construction equipment which come out of Resource Industries
177,We had quite a bit of rental load and a higher level of sales in late 2015 and throughout much of the first half of 2017 and that's kind of tailed off in the second half of â€
178,"“ I'm sorry, 2016, tailed off in the last half of 2016"
179,and we are not overly optimistic about that in 2017.
180,"So I hope that helps, Nicole"
181,"Well, you never want to say never"
182,"I mean, we did more in 2016 than we had expected when we announced the big program in late 2015."
183,So it's hard to say that nothing else would come up
184,"I mean, you don't have a crystal ball"
185,I think much of what is actually in 2017 as a cost is just a continuation of the things that are already in flight
186,"And the two things â€“ the two that we announced that we're contemplating, Aurora and Gosselies, would certainly add to that some in 2017 and probably still some in 2018."
187,"But beyond that, on the books right now, there's nothing else substantial that we're contemplating that hasn't happened"
188,"But, again, I certainly wouldn't want to try to make it sound like that's an ironclad"
189,"nothing else will come up, and nothing else will happen"
190,You just don't know what the world's going to do
191,But those two items would be â€
192,"“ other than the things that are already in flight, the only big new things that are currently on the horizon"
193,"Let me try to address that, Ross"
194,We're not looking for major declines in North America next year
195,"On balance, Construction looks â€"
196,“ our Construction industry segment looks fairly neutral year-to-year
197,"Our view is that the Middle East and North America will be a little softer, and Asia Pacific may be up a little, but we're not signaling some large continuing decline"
198,I wouldn't want to give you that impression whatsoever
199,And we have a range out there
200,"And you never know if economic growth is faster than we think, if tax reform comes sooner, if infrastructure spending comes sooner, maybe we can be towards the high end"
201,"So I don't want to make it sound like we're super negative on Construction, because that's not the case"
202,"In terms of the margins, I'm not sure what our competitors are doing, but I can tell you we've been out there working the cost reduction pretty substantially in Construction, in E&T and in Resource Industries and in Corporate elements"
203,"I mean, we've been taking out costs pretty aggressively"
204,And I think that that has contributed to the Construction margins that you see
205,I don't think there's production that needs to be cut substantially to make it better
206,"Dealers took out inventory in the fourth quarter about the same as they normally do, about the same as they took out in the prior year"
207,So I think inventories are in reasonable shape
208,I think production is in reasonable shape
209,"And when a little volume comes back, I think those margins will go up"
210,"Yeah, we did"
211,"Actually, we had decent orders in the fourth quarter"
212,"Obviously, we built backlog, and they were up from prior year reasonable double digits"
213,"So that's a good sign, but between â€"
214,"“ that's machines, that's RI and CI"
215,So that's good
216,"Hopefully, that'll continue"
217,"Thanks, Ross"
218,"Thanks, Jerry"
219,"Yeah, on the first one, we will just take them separately"
220,"With Aurora, we need to provide between the time of our announcement and the time that it's kind of finalized, we need to provide time for the local unions to look at it and see if there's anything they can do to contribute to that"
221,I mean you have a waiting period there
222,"And in Belgium, it's a little bit kind of the same way except the government is involved in addition to the local unions"
223,So we'll hopefully get the decisions made on both of those as soon as we can
224,Oh â€“ go ahead
225,"What was the second part of that again, Ross?"
226,Yes
227,"We have about $500 million of period cost reductions in for next year, and a lot of that is carryover from the actions taken this year"
228,"Well, we have $500 million of additional period cost reduction next year, and again, that doesn't include a little labor inflation and incentive pay"
229,"Outside of those two items, we have our period cost coming down $500 million, and what I'm saying is a decent part of that would be carryover from actions that we took in 2016."
230,"Oh, I'm sorry"
231,I'm sorry
232,"No, I don't have â€"
233,"“ I mean, certainly 2018 would definitely be higher in terms of benefits from restructuring"
234,"But at this point, we don't have a number for 2018."
235,And it will depend on what happens in Aurora and Gosselies and whether or not a decision actually gets made to close them or not
236,You're probably the only guy on today that's actually older than me
237,"Good questions, Eli"
238,"On dealer inventory, I talked a little bit about 2016 and 2015."
239,"For 2017, in reality, when we get towards the end of the year, what's actually going to happen with dealer inventory will depend a lot on how dealers feel about 2018, I mean, you could paint a scenario with, again, tax reform and infrastructure spending and lesser regulation and more investment in energy"
240,"If all that happens, maybe dealers will be more bullish about 2018 and want to add inventory"
241,So it's a little bit hard at this juncture to get very definitive about that
242,"And I would say in our sales forecast, right now, again, we're looking for each of the segments to not be far from flat"
243,"I mean, E&T down a bit on volume, RI down a little bit on volume"
244,"We're counting on a little more cost reduction, but the flip side of that is we do have a pretty sizable increase in incentive pay"
245,"And cost reduction and incentive pay is kind of universal across the company, so I wouldn't expect big variations in each of the segments"
246,You specifically asked about RI profitability
247,They have â€
248,"“ relative to their sales, they've done a lot of cost reduction"
249,"And given where their sales are, I won't comment on whether they're right at or more or less breakeven at the sales level, but it would be pretty close"
250,"I mean, it's â€"
251,"“ they're not far from breakeven at what's in the outlook for next year, which is 2016 probably minus a couple hundred million"
252,"So they're getting pretty close, and it's a result of a lot of good work on cost reduction, a lot of capacity â€“ or not capacity"
253,", floor space taken out, a lot of head count reduction"
254,"Well, certainly, on some of the larger construction equipment, we had a higher rental load in â€“ earlier in 2016."
255,"So I think we see that being down a little bit, particularly on large product"
256,"But I think the sentiment is what's important, not so much just the dealer â€"
257,“ or the rental fleet age point
258,I think it's â€
259,"“ there are a lot of positive signals out there, but it's not really turned into higher equipment sales yet"
260,And I think it's â€
261,“ there's still a bit to play out
262,But I think we see
263,and we hear the sort of general optimism about end markets
264,We hear that as well
265,"Quoting activity, orders a little bit have been more positive in RI"
266,"And again, those are longer lead times, so it's probably more of a 2018 story than a 2017 story"
267,"But yeah, I think we sense more optimism"
268,"Thanks, Rob"
269,"Ann, you made a point about FX currency and again"
270,So I would just add a couple of things to Jim
271,"One, we have a cost structure that's spread around the world, so â€"
272,“ and you can see that in today's release
273,"Well, actually, there was not a lot of movement, but over the last few quarters"
274,The moving value of the U.S
275,"dollar, it can change our sales, translate into more or less"
276,"But from a translation standpoint, we have a lot of costs outside the U.S"
277,as well as sales
278,So it has not had that big an impact on our financial results
279,So that's been a good thing and the result of work-over will be 40 years to diversify the currency that the cost base is in
280,"So I think, to a large degree, currency doesn't have too huge an impact"
281,"Now, certainly, there are some competitive impacts, like Komatsu if they're producing more in Japan and exporting to the U.S"
282,"So a particularly strong dollar against the yen can impact competitiveness, but in the ranges that we're at now, it's not something that's abnormal"
283,"Absolutely, we're a net exporter"
284,"I don't know the answer to that, Ann"
285,Yeah
286,I think if you look at the things we mentioned in the release
287,and I've kind of talked about today
288,", I think you can probably get your mind around the idea that the second half of the year probably has the most upside"
289,"All the things that we've talked about, tax reform, better economic growth"
290,"That's certainly not impacting what's on the books, getting produced and shipped here early in the year"
291,"In fact, probably for the first quarter, I think you can play into your first quarter thoughts"
292,"Basically kind of what's happening for the year will probably happen for the first quarter, so sales down a little, profit down a little versus a year ago"
293,"So I think if there's upside, it'll probably come later in the year, particularly if we start seeing better economic growth, we get tax reform kind of nailed down"
294,so people actually know what's coming
295,"The more that happens, the sooner the better"
296,No
297,We didn't provide any guidance on any margin by segment
298,"I was just kind of reacting to, on RI, is it going to be at breakeven?"
299,My comment was probably not â€
300,“ but probably not far from it
301,"And another point, David, and this doesn't really relate to your question"
302,"but I just wanted to â€“ of all the year-end adjustments that we had, the one that was included in segment margins was the goodwill adjustment"
303,And I know you know that
304,"So we have about 30% decrementals for the company next year on the lower sales, and we a have higher tax rate, as you mentioned"
305,"Those two items â€“ and the 30% decremental is a little bit higher than we've had over the last couple of years, and that's mostly because we have a lot more incentive comp"
306,"I mean, we paid very little this year and"
307,you know how that is a little bit of a moving target
308,"Each year, it kind of gets reset at the beginning of the year"
309,"So at this point, that is a headwind for next year"
310,"And outside of that, I think margins will be overall fairly similar to last year"
311,"Again, we've not provided any separate guidance on any of the segment margins"
312,And remember that incentive pay is going to be a headwind for all of them
313,"Andy, do we have you?"
314,No problem
315,It's been a long time
316,"Well, that is a very good question"
317,"And I guess in some ways, it's probably a little bit of all of it"
318,"We had, I would say, better comps"
319,"If you look at the pricing environment, it's â€"
320,“ I wouldn't be saying that it's gotten better or it's easier or competitors are out there raising prices
321,That's not the case
322,"It was worse in total, I don't remember what the separate number was for the year, but for the company for the year we were well over $700 million-ish negative"
323,I think what's happened is that stabilized
324,It doesn't look like it's getting any worse
325,"I don't think the pricing environment is any better on an absolute basis, but we don't see it getting kind of worse from here"
326,"We do use our operating and execution model, and you don't want to be doing silly things"
327,"You don't want to, for example, have big sales discounts on products you don't make much money on"
328,So I think we're trying to have the owning â€“ or the operating and execution model
329,guide us on where to spend our money on sales variance and discounting
330,But I think the main answer to your question is the comps have kind of started to flatten out
331,"So I don't get actual reporting on rebuild, but I can tell you for RI rebuild"
332,is the major driver of â€“ or is a major driver of parts sales
333,"So if I had to speculate here, I would say the answer to that is probably yes, because that's a good driver of parts sales"
334,And I don't think there's been enough of an increase in the backlog for regional differences to matter that much
335,"And I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I did look at them, and it wasn't enough for me to say, ah, we need to make this point that it was all here or here"
336,So probably nothing yet there to get too excited about
337,So I think we are going to stop the Q&A there for a moment
338,I want to turn the floor
339,We have a couple minutes left
340,"I want to turn the floor back over to our CEO, Jim Umpleby, for some closing comments"
341,All right
342,"With that, we will sign off"
343,"Thank you very much, everyone"
