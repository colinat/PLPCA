0,"As Jim stated, the second quarter continued what has been a great start to 2017."
1,"Before I walk through the announcements for the quarter and the revised outlook, let's turn to slide four, and I will walk quickly through the headline numbers"
2,Sales and revenues of $11.3 billion were up about 10% from the second quarter of last year
3,"While many of our end markets are far off previous peaks, we are starting to see several markets recover, and demand for China construction and North America gas compressions remain strong"
4,"Sales were higher in all three primary product segments, led by Construction Industries, followed by Resource Industries, and then Energy and Transportation"
5,Profit per share was up $0.42 from $0.93 to $1.35.
6,We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities
7,These actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles
8,"At the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs"
9,"As a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016."
10,"In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet"
11,Adjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49.
12,"Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement"
13,Improved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook
14,Now let's turn to slide five
15,"Second quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million"
16,Operating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%
17,Positive changes to operating profit came from several areas
18,The largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix
19,All four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues
20,"However, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets"
21,"China construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment"
22,Price improved $183 million in the quarter
23,The favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat
24,"Variable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production"
25,"As we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently"
26,Material costs were about flat in the quarter
27,"While our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half"
28,"So while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year"
29,"When exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure"
30,"As we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus"
31,"ME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables"
32,"ME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range"
33,"We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders"
34,"Now let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six"
35,Construction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion
36,Higher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase
37,"Most of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators"
38,"Through the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year"
39,Strength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment
40,"Sales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year"
41,"If you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast"
42,"You can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade"
43,"Continued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes"
44,"While we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels"
45,North America sales to end users were up and price realization improved
46,"However, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory"
47,North America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season
48,"However, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale"
49,"As you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction"
50,"As the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S"
51,"has been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales"
52,The United States is in need of infrastructure investment
53,Passage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business
54,"As expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017."
55,"However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively"
56,Order rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago
57,Let's move to slide seven
58,"Construction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products"
59,Period costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions
60,"Construction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability"
61,"Segment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year"
62,Let's move to slide eight and Resource Industries
63,Continued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%
64,"In order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off"
65,Then demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales
66,"And last, orders for new equipment would start to increase"
67,The cycle is starting to play out
68,Utilization on trucks is up 4% from last year
69,"The part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines"
70,And our order rates are improving
71,"After four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat"
72,Sales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions
73,"As you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter"
74,"However, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend"
75,Order rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year
76,"The backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year"
77,"However, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level"
78,We'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance
79,"On improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter"
80,"Segment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016."
81,"The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost"
82,Resource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point
83,These initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense
84,Resource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat
85,Next we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten
86,Sales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion
87,Higher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase
88,Sales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions
89,"Transportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application"
90,Sales into the rail industry were about flat
91,"While the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic"
92,The chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S
93,rig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices
94,The number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016.
95,U.S
96,oil production has increased accordingly
97,"In the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications"
98,"Demand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility"
99,Midstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure
100,"In addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells"
101,This discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region
102,We move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation
103,Energy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million
104,"This was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost"
105,Period cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense
106,"Before I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products"
107,Operating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services
108,The portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million
109,"Used equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter"
110,"We'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook"
111,We announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share
112,In April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion
113,"As a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook"
114,"At the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5."
115,We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment
116,We now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%
117,This is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America
118,Order rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged
119,The backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016.
120,We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half
121,"For Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere"
122,Fewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half
123,"In China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year"
124,"For Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%"
125,"While we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first"
126,"However, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales"
127,Energy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat
128,"We continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year"
129,We also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half
130,"Industrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up"
131,We move to slide 14.
132,"At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5."
133,The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense
134,"As compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58."
135,The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales
136,"Favorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%"
137,Favorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level
138,These favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion
139,Material costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year
140,"While geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth"
141,"However, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year"
142,We'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up
143,Operational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%
144,"While a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment"
145,"And demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment"
146,Orders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter
147,"We continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth"
148,"The balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter"
149,"Given year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share"
150,"With that, I'll turn it back to Amy"
151,"Ann, this is Brad Halverson"
152,Maybe just another comment about how we use that language
153,We use that language because that's how we're operating internally
154,We have now been through four years of a downturn
155,It's been hard on us
156,We've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at
157,"And so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future"
158,And this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company
159,"Yeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time"
160,"Typically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find"
161,So we reduce R&D or reduce other things
162,"In this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value"
163,They're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost
164,We have really increased spending in many of the growth areas
165,"We've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending"
166,So we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected
167,So I would say it's different than we would have historically done
