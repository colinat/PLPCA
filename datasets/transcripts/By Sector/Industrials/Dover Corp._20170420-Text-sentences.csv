1,Good morning everyone
2,Let's start on Slide three of our presentation deck
3,"Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 12%"
4,Growth from acquisitions of 12% was complemented by organic growth of 4%
5,Partially offsetting these strong results was a 4% impact from dispositions and FX
6,EPS was a $1.09 and included a gain of $0.39.
7,"Adjusted EPS of $0.70 exceeded the high end of our expectations, principally reflecting strong performance on higher revenue and a lower tax rate"
8,"Adjusted segment margin was 11.8%, an 80 basis point improvement over last year, largely driven by strong incremental margin on increased volume in our energy segment"
9,Bookings increased 21% to $2 billion
10,"This positive result was broad based and reflects organic growth of 12% and acquisition growth of 12%, offset by a 3% combined impact of dispositions and FX"
11,Total company book to bill finished at a seasonally strong 1.12.
12,"Overall, our backlog increased 20% to $1.3 billion"
13,"On an organic basis, backlog increased 13%"
14,"Free cash flow was $36 million for the first quarter, which is always our lowest quarter of the year"
15,Our quarterly result was impacted by inventory increases driven by selective pre-builds
16,"Overall, we remain committed to full year free cash flow of about 11% of revenue or 140% of net income"
17,Now turning to Slide four
18,Organic growth in the quarter was solid led by energies growth of 15% on improving US oil and gas fundamentals
19,"Refrigeration and food equipment increased 5%, primarily on strong retail refrigeration markets"
20,"Engineered Systems was up 2%, primarily reflecting continued solid growth in printing and identification"
21,"Fluids organic revenue declined 2%, principally reflecting weak longer cycle transport markets"
22,"As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids and Engineered Systems at 35% and 9% respectively"
23,Now moving to Slide five
24,Energy revenue of $324 million increased 14% year over year and 11% sequentially
25,"Earnings were $42 million and segment margin was 12.9%, both significantly improved over last year"
26,"These results exceeded our expectations, driven by continuing improvements in oil and gas fundamentals, especially the US retail"
27,These results also reflect strong conversion on volume
28,Bookings of $348 million were up 27% year over year and 16% sequentially
29,"These bookings trends, along with continued rig count additions and higher expected well completions, set us up for a strong second quarter"
30,"In total, in the second quarter, we expect year over year revenue growth of about 30% or 4% on a sequential basis"
31,Book to bill finished at 1.07.
32,Turning to Slide six
33,Engineered Systems revenue of $608 million was up 5% overall and included organic growth of 2%
34,"Excluding a gain on a disposition, earnings of $86 million increased 4% over an adjusted prior year, driven by volume growth"
35,Our Printing and Identification platform revenue of $249 million increased 4%
36,"Organic revenue was up 5%, reflecting solid global marking and coding and strong digital textile markets"
37,"In the industrial platform, revenue increased 6% to $359 million"
38,This result included net acquisition growth of 8% and a 1% organic decline
39,The organic decline was attributable to lower shipments at environmental solutions
40,"The remaining businesses in the industrial platform, all delivered solid organic growth, especially our auto service equipment business"
41,"Adjusted margin was 14.2%, essentially in line with last year"
42,"Bookings of $676 million were up 18% overall, including organic bookings growth of 12% and growth from net acquisitions of 7%"
43,"Organic bookings growth was very broad based, with printing and identification up 7% and industrials up 15%"
44,Book to bill for printing and identification was 1.03.
45,Industirals was 1.17.
46,Overall book to bill was 1.11.
47,Now on Slide seven
48,"Foods revenue increased 32% to $525 million, principally driven by acquisitions"
49,"This revenue performance primarily reflects solid activity across the majority of our businesses, especially retail fueling within fueling and transport"
50,This market is benefiting from robust activity in the US and also from improving international activity
51,"Overall, organic revenue declined 2% and FX was a 1% headwind"
52,"Earnings increased 14% to $53 million, largely driven by volume growth, offset in part by $4 million of integration and restructuring costs"
53,"Margin in the quarter was 10%, slightly better than expected"
54,"Bookings grew significantly to $566 million, an increase of 35%"
55,This result reflects acquisition growth of 35% and organic growth of 2%
56,Organics booking growth was broad based
57,Book to bill was 1.08.
58,Now let's turn to Slide eight
59,Refrigeration and food equipments revenue of $357 million included organic revenue growth of 5%
60,Organic revenue increase was largely driven by the strong activity in the glass door and refrigeration case product lines
61,"Food equipment results reflected solid organic growth in the commercial kitchen equipment markets, offset by expected lower shipments in can shaping equipment"
62,"Earnings of $34 million were down 12% year over year, reflecting a $2 million impact from a disposition in the prior year and approximately $2 million in restructuring"
63,"Margin was 9.4%, 110 basis points below last year and largely in line with our forecast"
64,"Bookings of $439 million increased 7% overall and 13% organically, reflecting strong order rates in nearly all of our end markets"
65,Book to bill was seasonally strong at 1.23.
66,"Going to the overview on Slide nine, let me cover some highlights"
67,Corporate expense and interest expense were both essentially in line with expectations
68,"Our first quarter tax rate was 25.7%, reflecting the impact of a disposition and other discrete items of about $0.04."
69,"Excluding these items, our normalized rate was 27.8%"
70,Moving on to Slide 10 which shows our 2017 guidance
71,"As Bob previously mentioned, we are increasing our annual guidance"
72,We now expect total revenue to increase 11% to 13% versus our prior forecast of 10% to 12%
73,"This forecast includes organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, up one point"
74,Our expectation for full year acquisition growth is largely unchanged
75,Completed dispositions will now impact revenue by 2% and FX is now expected to be a 1% headwind
76,"From a segment perspective, energy is now expected to grow 20% to 23% organically, up seven points over the last forecast, largely driven by the growth in our drilling and production and automation businesses"
77,"Engineered Systems and Fluids organic growth rates are both being raised one point at the low end, driven by solid bookings growth"
78,Refrigeration and food equipments estimated revenue range has been increased one point to reflect our strong first quarter and continued bookings momentum
79,Corporate expense has been increased $5 million and net interest expense remains unchanged from our last forecast
80,"Our full year tax rate is now expected to be slightly lower than our initial estimate, largely driven by favorable tax items reported in the first quarter"
81,Our forecast for CapEx and free cash flow is also unchanged from the prior forecast
82,"Lastly, we now expect full year segment margin to be around 14%, excluding the gain, up about 30 basis points from our prior forecast"
83,Turning to the bridge on Slide eleven
84,"Starting with 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.85 as a base, the year over year impact of lower restructuring cost in 2017 is unchanged"
85,"Performance, including volume productivity pricing and restructuring benefits, is now expected to increase $0.29 from the prior forecast at the midpoint, principally driven by our improved organic revenue forecast, especially at energy"
86,Compensation investment will now be about $0.02 higher than our prior forecast
87,The combined impact of interest corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.01 lower than our prior forecast
88,"Lastly, the full year net benefit from disposition will be $0.35."
89,This represents a gain on sale of $0.39 less the $0.04 of previously forecasted earnings from the divested business
90,"In total, we expect 2017 EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.20."
91,"With that, Iâ€™ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts"
92,Holy
93,Letâ€™s see here
94,I'm looking at Bob
95,So I actually don't have in front of me the data on the Wayne margins inclusive of ADNA
96,"They're not negative, but theyâ€™re - we are -"
97,"as your question infers, we are eating a fair amount of purchase accounting charges here in the first quarter"
98,"From a full year perspective, let me give you this comment"
99,I think you should have a fairly good feel for the ADNA for this business for the full year
100,We do see the operating margins for Wayne and Tokheim expanding through the year
101,"The first quarter is the lowest quarter of the year, both in revenue and earnings for this business"
102,"I think for the year, we're looking at margins for the year of 11% in my operating margins brand, 11% for the year, with the fourth quarter being maybe 300 basis points higher than the yearly average"
103,And the first quarter was -
104,I don't think we hit 8% operating margins in the first quarter
105,Just shy of 8%
106,So I guess to add to that
107,"The Wayne business is typically double digit, slightly over double digit type margin profile, ex ADNA again, all these numbers that Bob is talking about"
108,"And Tokheim, we've told you before is in the high single"
109,So the combination of those two â€¦
110,Is about 11 for the year
111,"Now, we're - what I would say is DFS or Dover â€¦"
112,"Fueling Solutions, we're off to a great start there"
113,"I would expect that we will beat our plan with respect to acquisition, delivery of EPS related to DFS"
114,Okay
115,So let's stay with the first quarter first
116,"As you know, the conversion there was significant year over year"
117,"Adjusted ex restructuring, Jeff, 60% conversion year over year, driven on the strength of drilling as you point out"
118,"Sequential improvement in margin on the higher volume about 30%, 31%"
119,"As I think about it going forward, and we gave you some numbers related to the second quarter in our script, the pre read, Iâ€™m thinking that the year over year for the year, for the full year, will be in the 40% range"
120,So coming off that high first quarter conversion will moderate based upon the mix of business
121,But sequentially I still see going sequential improvement in that 30% range
122,Still feel very comfortable with the year
123,"First quarter activity was a little bit stronger than we expected, Jeff coming into the quarter"
124,So the inventory levels naturally were a bit higher
125,"Receivables a little bit higher than we expected, but I would also tell you that in a couple areas of the business, we did make decisions about halfway through the quarter to do some selective pre-builds to make sure we were holding delivery times where we wanted them to be in the second quarter"
126,And that's -
127,they were â€¦
128,$40 million of inventory that was -
129,I would just label as pre-builds to support second quarter delivery schedules
130,"Slightly over 13, yes"
131,"So I think, Steve you're dead on with those numbers"
132,"Here what I would say, is we just went through energy"
133,Weâ€™re up 30 to 40 basis points from our last estimates
134,So that spread pretty evenly across the other three segments
135,Thatâ€™s the best way to think of it
136,So everybody up slightly with energy being up significant
137,Through the third and the fourth
138,No
139,Thatâ€™s just cash payments against the reserves
140,"Yes, in April"
141,About $2 million
