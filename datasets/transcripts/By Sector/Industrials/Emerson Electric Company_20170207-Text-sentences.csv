0,"Thank you very much, Craig"
1,I want to welcome everybody for joining us this afternoon
2,We just finished a 24-hour board meeting starting yesterday afternoon and going through this morning and just ending
3,"Also, having our shareholders meeting"
4,And fortunately all the proposition proposals passed the way the board recommended
5,That's a good situation
6,"And for all your shareholders, I did get re-elected as a member of the board"
7,Thank you very much
8,"And for the board, for the members out there that don't like me being Chairman and CEO"
9,", fortunately the vote was a tad under 40%"
10,so I still will be the Chairman and CEO for a while here
11,I appreciate that
12,"I want to also thank the whole organization across Emerson, around the world, as you all know, we've gone through a major transformation, repositioned the company, we've shaken up the organization"
13,We've sold off the businesses
14,We've now finished the pure divestiture of Network Power and LSCT
15,We have received the cash and we're cleaning up all the final points there
16,We will finish that in the second quarter just like we did in the first quarter
17,And now we're focusing on the two core businesses
18,"And as you saw, this is the first quarter reported, by themselves, executing around the new approach, the new strategy, the new organization"
19,We are executing well within that
20,and I want to thank the organization and the new people involved in this
21,And I also want to thank all the hard work that was done in the restructuring and the repositioning
22,"And you can see in the profitability, it's flowing through and we saw that in the quarter"
23,And that's a good time we're having the wind shift a little bit to our back
24,and we're starting to see momentum change
25,Those are all the good things that are underway
26,"Clearly, from our perspective, right now, we're still waiting for the final approval from the U.S"
27,from the FTC on Pentair
28,We're hoping to get that sometime in the next couple of weeks
29,and so we'll be able to close sometime by the end of March
30,We've already got approval from the EU.
31,They're approved
32,We're in good shape there
33,And most places around the world we have approval
34,We're waiting for the U.S
35,government to finalize their review of the situation
36,"As I look at the Automation Solutions business, as I've talked openly, as I've traveled and met with shareholders"
37,and I've had conferences
38,", we could see the trend start turning with the stability of the price of oil, with the stability of our main customer base"
39,"We're starting to see a increase â€“ slowly but surely increased demand around the world in key marketplaces and in key sectors, and that's a good thing"
40,"And we're starting to see that orders really turn into an improved pace of business, which should continue to happen as we go forward here for the rest of this year going into the second half and then into early 2018."
41,"On Bob Sharp's business, the Commercial & Residential they really started seeing improvement late last year in our fiscal quarter 2016."
42,"They had a very, very good start to this year with a sales and profitability and cash"
43,"And they have pretty good order pace still, and so we expect that business will continue to have a good growth around the world"
44,"They're seeing a pretty broad growth around the world, which is good"
45,"But in particular, I see the U.S"
46,", I see Asia and then also Europe really driving that"
47,So I think a really good start for both businesses
48,"One has already turned to growth; one is slowly getting their orders on pace and the lineup is, I would say, a quarter ahead of what we thought originally"
49,And so we're liking that
50,"And we'll have a lot of discussion around this at the Investor conference, which I believe is next week"
51,Next week in New York
52,"I haven't decided which charts we're going to show,"
53,which charts we're going to exclude and which cameras will work and won't work in the auditorium
54,But those are all things that are flexible and based upon the CEO discretion
55,And so we'll see how that goes
56,and we'll make that call when I get there in New York later this next week
57,Cash flow
58,"It is a good quarter for cash flow, though it's always the lowest quarter for us"
59,"The first quarter, it's our lowest quarter in sales and lowest quarter in profits and lowest quarter in cash flow"
60,"But really, we got a good start to cash flow and we feel good about still being en route (11:03) to $2.5 billion operating cash flow for the year"
61,"and it's very important as we look at what we want to get done internally, both through acquisitions and also in dividends and investments"
62,So really good execution
63,"The organization's set right now with the new organization, and you'll be exposed to some of those in the discussions we have in New York next week"
64,We're seeing the right markets move for us right now
65,and it's a good sign
66,"But overall, great start to the year"
67,"I believe that if the markets continue to move the right way, then we'll continue to see a good progress as we go through this year"
68,And that's why we've increased the year a little bit based on the first quarter performance and we'll move it as we go along here
69,"But right now, we're going to take one quarter at a time"
70,"And we just had a good quarter, and now we move to that second quarter and see where we are"
71,"As you saw on the charts, we gave you an estimate for the January"
72,"We did get the January orders, which were slightly better on a three-month roll than we did last month and a little bit of improvement in the Automation side"
73,"A little bit of slowdown in the Commercial & Residential, but that's not unusual month-to-month in that business, as some of the orders are sometimes lumpy versus the prior year"
74,"So overall, good start"
75,and we're looking forward to have a strong second quarter
76,We have a lot of questions I want to get to
77,We have probably a record number of questions
78,"I may not get to all of them, but we're going to start it here"
79,and I'm going to cut off my comments
80,I just want to thank the employees; I want to thank the organization for all they did here in the last three months
81,"And they just delivered a very strong quarter to shareholders, and"
82,I know I appreciate what they've done on behalf of the whole OC and the board
83,"So with that, I'm turning it over"
84,Question-and-Answer Session
85,"Good afternoon, Andrew"
86,That's a lot of ask
87,"I mean since I've been pretty bad at forecasts in the last couple years, Andrew, I mean you remember I did call that we'd turn last year at this time"
88,But â€“ so keep that in mind
89,"And from my perspective right now, I think that what we're seeing is the increased investments going on from a â€"
90,“ just from pent-up â€“ a situation for many years
91,We're starting to see some of that flow out both in the sort of in the Automation space but even also in the Commercial space
92,So I see a pretty steady recovery here
93,I don't see a snap
94,"As I've said, I've always felt that 2017 would be a good year of building that foundation and see a improvement"
95,I see a much stronger 2018 than I see 2017.
96,"But I see right now, based on what I'm seeing from the customer base, based on what I'm hearing from some of our customers and what they're saying they're going to spend on capital next year, overall, I think the pressure is upward, as I say"
97,So I see a pretty steady improvement for the trend line
98,"I do not see a strong snap, but I do see pretty good momentum going into 2018 as I look at it right now"
99,"Clearly, what goes on in Washington can have a big impact and a major shift in the sentiment around tax policies or trade policies"
100,Those things all could have a big impact
101,"But right now, I think momentum is going the right way, and we're seeing that"
102,And I don't see it slowing down at this point in time
103,"But I do not see a snap, as you said"
104,"Okay, two things going on"
105,"I think we've started seeing the MRO, when I went out and talk â€"
106,"“ and the shareholders I think in November and December, we started seeing this pick back up"
107,"The oil and gas companies, some of our key oil and gas companies, some of our chemical companies, some of our pharmaceutical companies started increasing their spending"
108,"They had kept it really, really tight, and I think as they saw, okay, there's going to be better, favorable policies to spend, encourage it, and to really encourage people to spend money, they started spending"
109,"It's a slow, okay, here's a little bit more money; you can go ahead and spend it"
110,And I've seen the budgets being set the same way
111,"So we're seeing a slow recovery in MRO around the world and pretty much across all segments, except for a couple of things like marine and segments like that"
112,But it's pretty broad-based
113,"And on projects, what we're going to see first and what we're hearing discussed right now with customers are, first,"
114,"the phase of, okay, let's make some investments on the quick turnaround, the quick hitters, the productivity ones, some of the safety ones, some of the areas that maybe we curtailed spending for a while, those are going to come back first"
115,Those are what we call in our business KOB3 quick cycle businesses
116,And then KOB2 is where they're going to look at brownfield
117,"typically expansion where maybe they cut the budget in half and only did half the project, or they've already had an expansion, but now they're going to look to that"
118,And that's the discussion we're seeing right now
119,I personally don't believe we'll see the big projects because our customer base probably got burned a little bit the last time in this for at least 18 to 24 months
120,"They have their hands full, in my opinion, on executing what's still left out there"
121,"They're working on the MRO, which is starting to happen, and they're going to work on the what I call the small, minor expansions to get a little bit of capacity here and there in what we refer to as KOB2."
122,"So a good mix for us, and that's what we're seeing in our funnel at this point in time"
123,And that's the type of orders we're seeing at this point in time
124,"Andrew, you take care"
125,Hopefully I'm a better forecaster this year than I was last year
126,"Good afternoon, Gautam"
127,Me?
128,I'm a very shy person
129,"Based on the trend lines right now, Gautam, I'd say Q3."
130,"I would hesitate to say, because I don't think any customer in our space would ever say they didn't spend on safety or key programs relative to the environment"
131,"But my opinion there from our perspective, I don't â€"
132,"“ there is a pent-up investment going into core facilities today around the productivity, around maybe efficiency and the facilities running better"
133,So I think there will be
134,I don't see a surge
135,"I don't see what I would say a strong, I think as Andrew asked me in the first question, I see a steady"
136,"okay, here's your capital budget this year and this is where I want to spend the money up front"
137,and I want you to start spending the money right off the bat
138,and that's what we've been seeing
139,So I think what we're going to see is this
140,"okay, we haven't spent as much money on keeping the facilities productive, safe, efficient, environmentally friendly, all those different things that you normally see with our industry"
141,", I think that's where they're going to go first"
142,And I don't think it's going to be a surge
143,"I think they're going to say here, you have this much money to spend"
144,but they're going to let them spend it rather than last year at this time they were starting to pull it back
145,"So that's what I see right now, Gautam"
146,The answer to the second question is no
147,We're going to talk about â€
148,“ I think there's a lot of logic to having the two pieces together
149,They're unique and there's a lot of sharing of technologies
150,"From my standpoint, I've gone through major reposition this company"
151,I've torn the company apart with the management team here
152,and I feel very comfortable we have the right two pieces
153,"They help each other from a standpoint of cash flow and earnings and technology sharing, things we can do back and forth"
154,So there's a lot of good things there in my opinion
155,"So, under my tenureship, maybe I'll get voted out and off the ship and somebody else will look at this but under my tenureship as CEO, we will stay within these two pieces at this point in time"
156,"On acquisitions, there are opportunities out there"
157,Our focus right now is totally on getting FTC approval on our Pentair Valves & Control business
158,I would expect us to continue to do smaller type of transactions this year
159,"And we're clearly looking, hopefully, to get somewhere between $500 million to $1 billion of additional transactions this year"
160,Maybe not totally close but get them locked
161,So those are being worked right now
162,So we are actually working transactions
163,and we just want to make sure right now our focus is get FTC approval so we can close Pentair Valves & Control
164,"So with that, on to next question"
165,"Good afternoon, Julian"
166,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
167,LLC
168,My first question would be around the incremental margins that you would expect to see in Automation Solutions
169,"Classically, they have been very strong in prior recoveries"
170,Should we assume the same this time?
171,"And maybe related to that, price of material, you've had tailwinds, really, since 2011."
172,Do you think you'll still have a tailwind in Automation over the next 12 months?
173,So let's talk about incremental margins
174,"From our perspective, we've been forecasting all year long that we'll have up margins at the Automation Solutions business"
175,So we would expect that the incremental margin on this business will be pretty good
176,We will clearly keep driving trying to get the profitability back up
177,â€
178,"“ clearly we're going to over the next couple years, get it back up to that 20% level"
179,This is excluding the Pentair Valves & Control but getting it back up to the level we were at 20% plus
180,But right now we're going to have pretty good
181,â€
182,"“ I would say, good leverage points"
183,like we have had historically in the past
184,It really is a function of how fast North America comes engaged
185,North America is getting engaged from a order sales standpoint because that's a better mix for us
186,but I would expect us to have good incremental margin at Automation Solutions as we come out of this cycle and well into 2018.
187,"The game plan, as you'll see, is we want to get back to historical margins in this â€“ well within this five-year planning period, excluding the Pentair Valves & Control which will obviously dilute it somewhat start working on that"
188,But that's the game plan
189,and so that's where we are right now
190,Relative to price cost
191,"As I've been talking for the last two quarters, we've seen the shift"
192,"So our net material inflation is less negative, i"
193,", we're not getting as much commodity benefits from the cost benefits from materials as there's been a slight inflating in the economy which is a good thing in reality"
194,"And from a pricing standpoint, we are still, probably, as we usually were six months behind"
195,"So as we said, the last four or five years, we've been green"
196,"Our price costs have been both slightly negative, from a negative price, negative net material inflation and we're green and they're offsetting it"
197,This year I think we're going to be plus or minus $25 million on the price cost
198,It could be $25 million green
199,It could be $25 million red
200,That's we're in the transition period right now
201,We see it happening
202,And so that's the game plan you're going to see relative to all of us try and figure out how to get the net material inflation down
203,How to start getting some incremental pricing
204,"But if you've been in a period for a while that pricing has been some pressure on the downside, now reversing that trend"
205,takes a little longer
206,But price/cost will be one of those issues this year that we'll be managing heavily
207,I'll be talking about it next week because you're exactly right
208,We've had a good run here
209,and now it's shifting
210,I like inflation a little bit from this perspective because we've had negative inflation for a while
211,"So the commodity standpoint will help us from our end market standpoint, too"
212,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
213,LLC Thank you
214,And then my follow-up question would just be on China
215,"Your sales were down, I think 8% in the September quarter; up 17% in December"
216,"Clearly, the boost you had in Commercial & Resi looks extreme"
217,But what's your overall sense of the demand picture for the rest of this fiscal year in China?
218,"I think if you go back and look at all the transcripts, I've always felt that we'd be somewhere around the 5% range for the total year"
219,"Right now with the start, it may be 5% to 6% or 5% to 7%"
220,So the recovery started last â€
221,“ it actually started in the fourth quarter for us
222,We had a positive fourth quarter in China and we had a very strong quarter
223,"And we had a good order pace from our Automation business too, so that's starting to recover"
224,"So I think that we're going to be somewhere in that 5%, 6%, 7% growth for China this year after some very difficult years"
225,"But our position from a cost standpoint and our position from a competitive standpoint in the markets that are starting to invest, we're in a good position right now"
226,"So I think China will be a good run here for several quarters, and so I'm looking at 5%, 6%, 7% for the year in underlying growth for China"
227,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
228,LLC Great
229,"You're welcome, Julian"
230,Thank you very much
231,I actually read your report this morning
232,I sent it around where I said I saw Joe said something nice about me
233,"Yeah, I actually do read this stuff to see if it â€"
234,"“ the truth of the lending stuff practice here, things like that"
235,"Yeah, Joe, it's what's in the past"
236,", what I've seen is you probably get three or four good quarters of that"
237,So we started seeing some of that in the fourth quarter of last year and again this year
238,"So historically, what I've seen is they run a little too heavy"
239,They get too excited and they overbuild
240,"But I would say this is going to run at least three or four quarters, so I would say well into our third quarter"
241,"The good part of this, though, is we're seeing a broad base across Asia-Pacific for us"
242,"So China's â€“ yes, we had a very good two quarters here"
243,But we're starting to see the rest of our Commercial & Residential business growing across all of Asia-Pacific
244,So that hopefully will come in to kick into play and help us pick up if China slows down
245,"But right now, it looks pretty good for the whole year but my gut always tells me"
246,"I'm watching these guys for around three or four quarters, they overbuild and they scale back down"
247,But the efficiency thing's changing
248,"The environment stuff's changing, so we'll see"
249,But that's what I feel right now
250,"But I'm really encouraged by the fact that all of Asia-Pacific is really starting to invest in some of, I would say, the retail stuff and also, the food chain stuff and some of the refrigeration stuff, which is all good business for us"
251,"Historically, your statement is a true statement"
252,We would have two or three quarters where our cash flow would fall behind a little bit from earnings
253,"The one thing that might happen that we could do depending how fast we get our hands around Pentair, the Valves & Control piece, as I've talked about, they have close to 50% trade working capital"
254,"So they have a lot of things we want to get our hands on, but that may take me maybe into the cycle"
255,"So if we get engaged in the end of March, early April"
256,"and I have a chance to work on this for two or three or four quarters, then I think then we could have cash flow actually out-run earnings because of what we have opportunities there"
257,"But historically, if 2018 takes off like I think 2018 could take off, then we would do exactly what we said: my working capital would build up a little bit; my receivables will go up a little bit"
258,"We run a very good shop here from working capital, but the benefit I'm going to have is we will very much go after the Pentair Valves & Control acquisition working capital"
259,and hopefully we can get some of that off to make up for what we go in
260,And maybe we'll get cash flow to grow a little faster than earnings
261,But you're exactly right what you said
262,Two or three quarters most likely that will happen
263,Thank you very much
264,"Good afternoon, John"
265,"Oh, not too bad"
266,We're basically right now â€
267,“ the best analysis
268,right now we're working this issue
269,"and we're about neutral both in and ex, today"
270,"Yeah, well, it's for me to know"
271,"and you not to know,"
272,but that's okay
273,But what I'd tell you this is that we're studying a lot
274,We're looking at the trade flows
275,We have a very strong presence
276,"As you know, we have a very global regional manufacturing strategy, which we'll talk about next week"
277,"So from our perspective, right now we're looking at the trade flows and we're looking at the different analyses, what would happen relative to the approaches coming out of Washington relative to tax policies or to tariff policies or whatever"
278,And there are some products that we can move within 6 to 12 months
279,Some will take longer if we need to be
280,Hopefully there'll be some rational thought process out of Washington around this issue
281,"But we are studying it really hard, and as you well know, we know how to execute around that"
282,We did the same thing in Asia many years ago with China as we redirected where our China for China manufacturing
283,"So at this point in time, we're looking at where we have imbalances, we're looking at the timing of what we would have to do if we had to make a change, or if it's just a minor change because of the cost structure"
284,So we're getting ready in dealing and getting our inputs
285,"But as you look at it right now is that, what you have to understand is Emerson will be ready"
286,Emerson will make the adjustments as necessary and will stay competitive in this situation to make sure that we do not be penalized from a cost and a competitive standpoint
287,But we're going to be very fluid
288,and we're getting ready
289,Let's put it that way
290,"Yeah, John, I think that from our perspective, we see no indication that we can't set record levels of profitability in these two businesses as we come out of the cycle and get into a normal cycle"
291,The Commercial & Residential Solutions were running at high levels
292,"They're working at, on the platform levels, how they can get additional cost out and do the right integration that gives them the flexibility to both have margin improvement and incremental investments"
293,"On the Automation side, historically, we've been able to, even in a recovery time period, we can get back to the historical levels"
294,"There's a level of profitability that we find that we start to under-invest in the company, but there's nothing in our cost structure that says that we cut corners to not invest in or spend money on that we're going to have to rush right back in"
295,"So I think cost will go back in when we believe that the growth is happening, and will continue to march up as we get our profitability back in the Automation Solutions business, because it did get hit quite hard from the low-20s all the way down into the 16% range"
296,So we're looking to get that back up there
297,And I don't think there's anything extraordinary here
298,We'll get better leverage in the first part and then it will slow down as we start putting some costs back in
299,We'll bring people on in certain marketplaces if we're going to expand our technology
300,It'll be a very systematic approach as we look at the growth in the business and the leverage of the business
301,and we'll start making sure we make the right investments at the right time
302,We know where we took them out and we'll start thinking about where we want to put them in differently because there's always a chance to put them in differently
303,and that's what we're looking at right now
304,"Good afternoon, Deane"
305,Good
306,We'll give you a lot more updates in the numbers
307,what we see for the 2017 and 2018 for Valves & Control next week
308,but it really hasn't changed much
309,There'll probably be a little less restructuring
310,Probably around only $25 million the first year
311,That means more in the second year
312,It'd still be slightly dilutive on a earnings per share standpoint
313,Cash flow accretion still there
314,Relative to getting ready
315,"is I want to thank Randy Hogan and his team and Ed Monser,"
316,"within the right scope of the government rules, we've been working on this for the last two months, or two quarters not two months"
317,Two quarters and so the integration team is ready
318,The organization is its structure is known
319,We've already set that
320,and we let the people know what they're going to be doing from day one
321,So our plans have been refined and ready to go and as soon as we get approval
322,and we get close we'll be running
323,We plan to run on the block here because we've used every extra day and every extra week and every extra month here to get further and further down the playing route and Randy Hogan and his team has allowed us to work â€
324,“ his guys to work with us and that's been very appreciative
325,That way we get a much faster running start and get them integrated in
326,"Which is a benefit for them too because they get integrated into a very large global automation solutions company, too"
327,Which helps them but we're ready and we're just waiting to get FTC approval
328,and we've got everywhere else
329,done and now we've just got to get those arduous government approvals
330,and we're going
331,Period
332,Very good
333,I think that revenue synergies will take a couple years
334,We've always said that but not only just from the management of the businesses
335,but we've also been working on the integration of sales channels on a global basis
336,"So we know how we're going to manage that by world area and the key customers accounts and where we mean to make investments and where, maybe, we need to beef up things"
337,So I would say that maybe we've shaved off six months on getting to the sale synergies because we've had more time here
338,"but our focus really is, the first couple of years, to get the cost integration done and some of the sale synergies will start happening probably as we get into early 2018."
339,And so I think we're ready both on the cost integration side and the sales side and the leadership side of ready to go because we've been managing it and setting it
340,"and my compensation committee has allowed me to get things approved, even though we don't own it, so we're ready to go"
341,Thank you very much
342,"She did a good job on your name, there"
343,"It's closer than I could get, Josh"
344,"To be honest, I don't think that there's any change in the seasonality and the pace is"
345,I can't remember the first question I had on this
346,I don't see this being a surge
347,I see this being a steady mountain climbing here as we're seeing our customer base actually incrementally increasing the spend
348,"And so I think that what we're seeing right now is a pretty marginal, I mean, the typical seasonal pattern here"
349,The one issue will be is I'm sure you've heard a lot of the companies in our space that serve this industry saw slower amount of what I would say service and â€“ take off the business down â€
350,“ I'm trying to think of what the name of that word is â€
351,“ when you take the plants down
352,"Changeover, shutdown"
353,I think you're going to â€
354,"“ we didn't see as much the last 18 months of that, and it's usually in the fall"
355,So we might see more of that where some of these facilities that really weren't shut down that much last year and rehabbed and upgraded
356,"I think we might see more of that in the fall this year, which will mean probably a stronger first quarter going into the next fiscal year"
357,Because a lot of facilities really cut back the turnarounds
358,I'm thinking turnarounds
359,I think we had less turnarounds
360,"â€“ the lowest number of turnarounds I've seen in a long, long time"
361,"And so I think that'd be the only change to your point, Josh"
362,I think we'll be steady as we go on seasonality
363,We could see a bigger turnaround in our fourth quarter and then the first fiscal quarter of next year
364,"That will be the only thing I see changing right now based on my knowledge base, which"
365,"as you know, is limited in this market"
366,I don't know that much
367,I don't agree with that statement
368,And I think this is a normal where they've held back from an efficiency standpoint or a capital standpoint
369,And I think these are the things they need to do from an environmental expansion and stuff like that
370,I do not have that flush
371,"And again, I'm talking about our businesses, Josh"
372,"Maybe some of these guys have other different businesses, but our orders in Automation, our orders in Commercial & Residential do not say flush"
373,They say this is a long-term project investments they're doing and these are planned
374,And it's not a flush
375,So that's my read on it
376,"Don't know China all that well, so"
377,"Good afternoon, Nigel"
378,And it's â€
379,"“ like I said, I'm never as dumb as I thought I was"
380,and I'm never as smart as I thought I am too
381,"so here we are, huh?"
382,"I think that what we've seen so far â€“ obviously in the early cycle of a MRO recovery, you're going to get more instrumentation, more flow, which we typically would see and that's what's happening"
383,You do see get â€
384,"“ you do get some valve upgrades and replacements, but you typically will see the early cycle, which we're starting to see is the instrumentation and the flow side"
385,That's the first places that gets the biggest bang for their buck on the quick investment
386,"So that's what we're seeing right now, and I would expect that to continue"
387,"Even though the valves business has been good, I would still say that underlying decline is still in line where I would expect it to be"
388,We're really seeing the instrumentation side and the flow side come back up on the MRO
389,"And so I think that's going to be normal, and I don't see that changing in â€“ for the cycle here at all"
390,"And so the turnaround for the valves will be more relevant when I get out into the late 2017, going into early 2018"
391,"and that's where the valves would see a little bit more MRO, from my perspective"
392,No changes right now
393,I think that we still â€
394,“ we have reconfirmed
395,We probably â€
396,"“ as we've spent more time together, we probably have seen some of the expansion of the plants, the integration of plants and some of the organizations that we've tweaked it here and there"
397,"But nothing changed from our initial strategy, what we see at this point in time"
398,"So yeah, we've been reconfirming"
399,"The key thing for us with extra time is really to get the organization structure and to get the names in the boxes of the right leadership, Randy, which has been extraordinary"
400,"He's allowed me to talk to his people relative to opportunities and things like that, which is important so we can hit the ground running"
401,"And when we do get closure from the final approval from the government, we can tell everybody this is your job"
402,and they already know it
403,"and they can go from day one, which means a lot in a structure like this on a global company"
404,This is a very global company
405,So that's why I really want to commend Randy for letting me do that
406,I don't know the number off the top of my head
407,Frank?
408,We'll have to look
409,I would say it would have to be up a tad
410,I heard Mike say today to the board
411,(sic)
412,"Nigel, thank you very much"
413,"Good afternoon, Mr. Stifel Robby"
414,We're going to show that to you next week
415,"I mean, I think structurally we're looking at Commercial & Residential through the work that Bob's doing, both with investments, and then also, Jim Lindemann working on his organization"
416,I think we're going to get to a â€
417,"“ that margin's going to run around 24%, 25%"
418,That's where it's going to run
419,"And if the pace of business goes well and the mix right, it should easily get to 25%"
420,"On the Automation Solutions business, our goal is to get that back up into that 20%, 21%, where it was before"
421,That's a sweet spot from us from the standpoint of our mix and what we can try to do with that
422,Maybe even get to 22%
423,"This is about Pentair, based on what, if the U.S"
424,stays well and strong in the oil and gas area
425,"But structurally, we take a lot of cost out, (46:14)"
426,"so we can take that, those businesses back up to that level in this planning cycle"
427,"So I feel pretty good about that from that standpoint, and so we're going to make pretty good money on the margins of this business as we get back up there, and we'll be setting record levels of profit margins as a total company based on what we've done to the cost structure for this repositioning effort"
428,Going back to â€
429,“ so I can't remember who asked this question to me about Mexico
430,I don't know if it was John Inch or someone like that
431,"But the question for me is, right now, we're getting ready for any changes to the NAFTA agreement"
432,We have to understand where we are today and because we've been running our NAFTA for 25 years
433,"And so we're looking at the flows and things like that what our position is today, how much rigidity to timing if it moves up"
434,So we're looking â€
435,"“ that is a very important work going on at the company right now because based on what comes out of Washington tells me that, okay, either we're going to have to slow our expansion or reverse and bring some stuff back north of the border"
436,So we're going to have to look at all those different things as based on what comes out of Washington
437,"And generally, right now, the people are looking at more investments in the U.S"
438,"versus less investments, so are hedging their bet"
439,"Because people are investing right now, so spending's happening"
440,"The other issue, as you well know, they're looking at giving you 100% first year, I guess, amortization and depreciation, which also will have a big positive impact on spending and productivity"
441,"So my main focus right now are, okay, which way do you think they're going to go relative to the tax rate,"
442,which way they're going to go relative to any type of taxing on imports/exports?
443,Is there going to be a slap on duties just because he's getting impatient?
444,"But right now, I'm looking at all these different things, and we're getting our options prepared"
445,so we can start moving
446,"As you well know, we're really, really good at managing once we know the playing field relative to our manufacturing structure and where we're going to move things"
447,"And we're getting ready and we're creating options, as I've told the board, and we're prioritizing based on the competitive situations which, if I don't do it fast, I'll be at a competitive disadvantage"
448,"If I don't have a competitive issue, I don't need to do it as fast"
449,So we're getting ready
450,"The good thing that I saw as I traveled the United States in the second half of the calendar year 2016 is I knew, I could sense that there was going to be a pick-up in spending in the last couple of months because I could see the price of oil firming"
451,", I could see the budgets hadn't been spent, just based on what I felt out there"
452,That has flowed through again on the same curve as we saw in December
453,So that tells me our customers are allocating capital at least equal to or slightly higher to the capital that they went out the year with
454,So that's a good sign for me
455,"So that's the one thing I saw, and I want to see again in February, does that continue?"
456,"Because that tells me the capital is being allocated and freed up for people to spend, and that's a key sign to me relative to my Automation side"
457,Thank you very much
458,"Good afternoon, Shannon"
459,I don't see any slowdown in those businesses
460,"I think that the pharma side of the business marketplace should be good for the rest of this year, probably early into 2018."
461,"It runs in cycles, but it looks pretty good right now with a lot of new drugs, a lot of repositioning and things going on"
462,So I think it looks good and some of the new regulations
463,"I think that looks good, pharmaceutical, for well into 2018."
464,"We had a big surge, and I think it will just be a steady improvement now"
465,"Relative to the power side, I think you're still seeing people upgrading their facilities"
466,I do not see power being back down
467,"They're still taking old coal power plants off, putting gas power plants in"
468,We have some nuclear investments around the world
469,"So the power looks to me like I would say through 2018, it looks pretty good to us at this point in time"
470,"On chemical, I think that a lot of that has to do with â€"
471,“ I'm looking at what our customer base is going to be allocating relative to capital and relative to where they want to locate some of their new capacity
472,There's been a push to get into North America
473,"If that continues with the low price of gas that's a good sign for us, and so we should still see a pretty good chemical spending"
474,"But right now, those three markets are, I think will trend well for us, with power probably being one of the better ones for us for at least the next 18 months"
475,"Well, it's really what we're changing â€"
476,"“ someone keeps asking the question how much is this, you just take out like cost, sales and sales people, engineering people?"
477,"The platform structure is actually as a permanent structure as we change the way we do business where we're starting to integrate procurement, you're integrating some of the manufacturing, integrating engineering"
478,You're actually taking some what I'd call real structural changes
479,"so it really lowers the cost, so what we've been able to do through this integration platform"
480,", you look at the margins of this business since we announced the Commercial & Residential Solutions business integration on our bar chart (52:49)"
481,you see a steady improvement in the profitability of this business
482,We had a very good improvement last year in the second half
483,We saw a pretty good first quarter here
484,So those are things that we see happening that will stay there and that also allows Bob to have money to invest incrementally
485,"So Bob has been already starting to invest in some of the key areas relative to the food safety, some of the transportation stuff"
486,"And so I think that the reason I said the platform, this one in particular gives us a chance to reinvest in the business and pass some higher margin (53:17) on which I think you have been seeing for the last couple quarters in our Commercial & Residential business and should see for the rest of this year"
487,Yuck
488,"Now, am I supposed to call you Christopher"
489,or you want me to call you Chris?
490,That was a good game
491,"The Rally Monkey is definitely out, Chris"
492,I've got the Rally Monkey
493,Rally Monkey sleeps on my bed at night
494,It sits right there
495,It's ready to go at all times
496,"You never know at my age you need a Rally, you know?"
497,We had some favorable mix
498,"The business did do better, Chris"
499,I think one of the guys asked earlier about this
500,They're on a good path
501,They're on a curve that you normally see a recovery
502,The cost reductions really have taken hold
503,so we've got a bigger bump relative to the uplift in the profitability
504,They had a good mix
505,"Obviously with the shift coming towards instrumentation, some of the flow, some of the (54:56), that does help us"
506,"Secondly, we also saw some currency help in the quarter, which we could have for a couple of quarters"
507,and we have to take some of that back
508,"But overall, I want to tell that team has done a phenomenal job taking costs out through the last 18 months"
509,"And so when they start seeing some what I would say uplift in the trend lines, you're starting to see that improved profitability"
510,But some things did go further away for the first quarter and hopefully that will continue in the second quarter
511,"But overall, profitability was very good in that business"
512,"They did get benefit from mix, they did get benefit from a little bit of currency"
513,But hats off to those guys
514,You're talking about how far down they are from where they were and then running those levels of profitability is darn good
515,"Yeah,"
516,"yeah, I don't see"
517,We're almost done with the corporate restructuring and the downsizing based on a smaller company
518,"We're also still tweaking a little bit about what is done at the two-platform levels, what's done in corporate"
519,There's always that discussion
520,"We brought Mike and Bob onto the OCs so they can participate in this, but there's a level of governance as you well know that I and Frank are responsible to the board"
521,"And so I think we're getting to the point that I feel comfortable with and then, when we bring Pentair on and we have to figure out how to get them incorporated onto some of our controls and stuff like that, we're going to have to add a few there"
522,But right now I think we've got it where we want it
523,"And again, that's a lot of hard work to do what these guys did, to take that structure out like we did"
524,No
525,I don't think the global competitive dynamic's changed much right now
526,The euro's been bouncing pretty tight between $1.06 and $1.08.
527,If it goes to $1.10 it'll be a real nice wind at my back
528,"We've got our European structure right now pretty good, because we went through this process where the euro really weakened"
529,So right now the dynamic world is pretty set and we haven't had a lot of changes
530,"It's been more of a, I would say, what's coming out of the political arena more than anything else is creating some changes"
531,But we'll see what happens here
532,"Right, we're all â€"
533,"“ I'm watching very clearly what the Washington folks decide to do relative to trade, what they do to tax"
534,Because we are in a situation in pretty good from the standpoint of a cost structure
535,and so we're going to have to adjust and figure out where we go from there
536,We're about as competitive
537,"we've been in a long, long time at running at where we are right now"
538,"Frank just told me on the backlog, we're slightly down year-over-year â€"
539,“ up sequentially which is what these guys look at
540,"We're up sequentially, but down year-over-year"
541,"So from fourth to first we're up, but first to first we're down which makes sense"
542,So the trend is going up
543,Somebody asked that question
544,"Oh, I like that one"
545,I'm always looking for nicknames
546,"Chris, you take care"
547,"look forward to seeing you next week, okay?"
548,I just gave them authority to two more after you
549,(59:02)
550,I stayed up
551,"In fact, I was going to bed and my son called me, said, dad, you need to turn the TV back on"
552,"and I said, what?"
553,I'll show a chart in charge next week
554,I'll give you quarter by quarter
555,It looks to me like about $50 million for our core business plus or minus that number
556,I can't call within $10 million and it looks to me right now around $25 million for Pentair
557,"Again, I'll show you quarter by quarter, I'd show you how we think it's going to unfold here and what our saving's going to be"
558,"Given the fact that we're going to be as I say next week late in the cycle of getting Pentair on board, we probably won't get much of savings help for the first"
559,but we're getting some of the restructuring done that will help us early on in 2018.
560,So that's what we see right now
561,"and we'll give you sizing relative to what we see from the other charges we have to do from a inventory standpoint, the valuation of inventory, the valuation of backlog"
562,"We have some estimates right now, but we're still working on that"
563,but we're ready to go
564,(01:00:34)
565,We're definitely taking advantage
566,and I'm going to have Bob talk about that next week for you guys
567,"You know there's a lot going on around the technology area right now relative to the efficiencies, relative to the refrigerants, relative to some people not investing for some time, the energy stuff"
568,I think there's a lot that's why the show was so strong
569,"I think people, for a change, are going to have some money to spend"
570,and I think these guys are looking at where they can spend
571,so that's why I think there was so much energy around that
572,"And if you think about North America refrigeration, these guys are going through some of the biggest transformations they're going to have to ever do in efficiency"
573,"and so I think especially in refrigerants, these guys are all gearing up and that's why people are so energized"
574,"And so I think we could have a good run here in North America through 2017 and 2018, which will be a good thing to have which we've been waiting for as you know"
575,"Well, we try"
576,"I mean, don't get too excited"
577,"We might not do a very good job, you know"
578,And don't bring your camera
579,Okay
580,"Hello, Rich"
581,You're the next to the last one
582,You got under the net
583,You're sort of like got your nose under the finishing line there
584,"Rich, the question â€"
585,“ and I've forgotten â€
586,“ somebody asked me a question about distribution earlier
587,"and I forgot to answer it,"
588,my fault but
589,"that question is one of the early signs, when we know that the incremental spending on MRO, the incremental spending in upgrading the facilities both in oil and gas or any type of facilities, it goes through the channel, the industrial channel which is the rigid"
590,We start seeing that channel pick back up in October
591,And so what that tells me is that they're seeing activity within their core marketplaces relative to industrial world or oil and gas and the chemical world and they're bringing in the tools and equipment ahead of time
592,and they're starting to spend
593,So we've seen that channel improve
594,"We've seen our orders improve, our sales improve, so that's a good sign for me"
595,"So I want to watch that going back to my earlier comment, for the next couple of months because if they continue to do that, that means it's selling through"
596,"And then their customers are actually doing the ongoing MRO, they're actually doing some of the incremental facility rehabbing or upgrading"
597,"And so right now, the trend is good and"
598,I have a lot of indicators within Emerson and that is one of them and that one is on par where I think it should be relative to the cycle
599,"And given the fact that I run it, I understand that pretty well and that tells me they should do pretty well here for the next couple of quarters"
600,20%
601,"Yes, 20%"
602,"Yeah, you bring your Polaroid and we'll see where it goes"
603,"It was good talking to you, Rich"
604,"Okay, who's last?"
605,Who's it?
606,Steve Tusa's last
607,"If I know it was Tusa, I would've cut him off"
608,"And well, yeah,"
609,and I know because you never use cameras
610,You've never done that to me
611,"I know, you're very good at that because you're an honest person"
612,"You didn't hear my opening comments, Steve"
613,"I talked about, I'm still having the decision"
614,I mean had the guys and gals right across
615,and I have five planners working with me
616,and I have these red dots everywhere
617,and Craig walks in there and starts looking like he's got the measles because he saw
618,", you can't omit all those charts"
619,so we're in a strategy right now
620,This is the way I think
621,I'm thinking about omitting like 20 charts and then have them stuck somewhere
622,that it feels like a hide and seek type of thing
623,"Well, no, he's not going to get"
624,"He's going to get the chart, he's going to have them if I just do it"
625,"Now, I don't know I always have some elimination"
626,"and I think over the years we've been, people have never abused it so we've been more careful about it"
627,so I give more out
628,"But probably I'd say less omitted this year than I have in the past, Steve"
629,(01:06:24)
630,"just fun of it, just admit it, have it rolled it up inside somewhere"
631,"Yes, the biggest delay has been, we've had first of all we have a presence in the process world, as you know"
632,We're pretty broad across the various technologies and we've had a presence in the control side
633,"And I think a lot of both from a competitive standpoint, a customer standpoint and the challenge standpoint around the world, I think they all want to understand, okay, what would this be the impact to the industry"
634,was far more inquisitive about this than anybody else
635,They're the last of the basic approvals
636,"Really not been government, the FTC has a lot on their plate"
637,They've been expeditiously working with us on this thing
638,"They've got a lot of mergers and acquisitions are working on, so I don't blame this on the government"
639,I'd just blame it on the fact that they're doing a very thorough review
640,They're looking at a significant sized acquisition that will change the profile of our business and what that means from our customer standpoint
641,And I think they're checking the boxes like they should be checking the boxes
642,It's taken them longer than I thought only because you've got a lot of information that once they start getting into it they have to go through it
643,"but we're hoping here later this week that everything's signed off on, where we'd go and what we have to deal with"
644,And that we'll close as quickly as possible as we can in March
645,"And we've got everything ready to go from the standpoint where cash has got to be, what the organization"
646,so we're ready to go and hit the ground running
647,and it's a lot of work of the FTC to understand the marketplace which they probably would normally not look at
648,"I think we will get clarity as a nation by late summer, early fall"
649,I think it will take time to get it rolled out and
650,so that means that's why we're getting ready from the standpoint
651,I believe we will get some kind of tax reform which will include probably some trade renegotiations around that and what that means relative to how we bring products in and out of the country back-and-forth
652,But I think it'll be tied around tax approaches to come up with a more equal tax policy and structure for the U.S
653,companies which will be good for us
654,But I think it's going to take a while for them to get that done because there's a lot of gives and takes and it will obviously include repatriation type of approach on an ongoing basis around the world
655,"so we pay it, no matter where we make the money and get the money back"
656,"So I'm looking for clarity by late summer, early fall and that gives me time, as I get into execution later this year, early 2018 based on if I have to change anything"
657,"The reason we have a high tax rate is because we're very strong and powerful and we manufacture a lot in United States and we sell a lot in the United States, we make a lot of money in the United States, we manufacture a lot in the United States"
658,So we've always paid our taxes on the U.S
659,tax structure
660,So our effect tax rate in United States is 37%
661,"So based on if you really had true tax legislation coming through, Steve, where there's some changes, maybe some of the cross-border movements around and some taxes here and there to try to rebalance that, our tax rate should move down into the 20s based on what happens to the final â€"
662,“ how does it come out
663,"But it really makes a difference of what they do with all the different ins and outs relative to the imports, the exports"
664,what they do relative to some of the treaties
665,But we fundamentally pay in the U.S
666,that type of tax rate
667,"tax rate down to 20% or 15%, say 20%, we will move down towards that"
668,But I expect that some of the other things will go against us
669,"But overall, our tax rate should come down with true tax reform and tax policy rather than tax edicts, so it should come down"
670,"Again, I want to thank everybody for joining me today"
671,I want to thank my organization for the great job they did the last three months and look forward to another strong second quarter
