0,Thank you very much
1,"Good afternoon, everybody"
2,"First of all, I want to say that we did have a good recovery in the second quarter, and from the performance level based on what we discussed on the February conference call we did slightly beat what we'd discussed in that call"
3,Orders for the three-month roll were 4.5% positive in the three-month roll for the quarter
4,"Sales were flat, slightly above where we thought they'd be"
5,"Our GP, gross profit margin, our operating profit margin, our EBIT margins were all up and, yes, Automation Solutions margins were up underlying but we made the decision to clean up potentially future receivable issues primarily around Venezuela, and we wanted to make sure that we're perfectly clean coming out of this quarter"
6,given what's going on down in Venezuela
7,So we made that choice here in the corporate world to make sure that we had no risk relative to potential receivables in Venezuela
8,So we made that decision and we did hurt the margin by 50 basis points relative to that
9,"From the EPS standpoint, I said that the EPS would be most likely slightly down or, at best, flat"
10,We did beat slightly our EPS last year
11,Our free cash flow was stronger and exceeded our earnings by over 100%
12,So a very good quarter
13,and we have momentum
14,"As we look at the current order pace, and you remember the blue band that we laid out in February in our presentations, from the standpoint of that blue band we're now running above the blue band"
15,"It doesn't mean we may not drop back down below the blue band or back in the blue band, and that was a chart that you did get â€"
16,"“ you did get that chart so don't accuse me of not giving you that chart, you did get that chart"
17,â€
18,"“ we are now running as of this month, the current month, in the 5% to 6% level of underlying orders"
19,So our order pace continues to do better
20,We're starting to see the mix change between shorter-term cycle orders and some medium cycle orders coming in
21,So it will mean that obviously we're going to start building some backlog as we go forward here in the coming months
22,"The other thing that you'll see in the third quarter, and I want to talk very openly about the third quarter"
23,", we would expect our underlying sales in the third quarter to be up, up 4% to 5%"
24,"We'd expect our operating margins, the performance at the operating levels at the operation businesses, up for the quarter"
25,"The big issue that we need to discuss so people don't get carried away is from the standpoint of the corporate cost this year, we had an artificially low corporate cost benefit last year by the tune of almost about $30 million from the standpoint of one-time benefits we got last year, from a Byrd Amendment benefit that we got â€"
26,"“ it's a dumping duty that we got a sudden payment from pension, from other actions"
27,"This year, we're going to be having our corporate costs would be over, I think on the OID level, will be over $100 million"
28,"It will be higher so, therefore, we're going to lose a lot of money at the OIOD level primarily from last year's $40 million to over $100 million this year"
29,And it's driven around a couple of areas
30,It's driven by that we now are booking some of the costs from the acquisition of Pentair Valves and Control
31,We will not have the benefit of the Byrd Amendment this time
32,"We will have also the incentive comp because, other than today's stock price, the stock price has been doing pretty well,"
33,so because of the stock price rise we have a benefit of that
34,"And with the pension accounting rules changed just last year, this year we have over $10 million of incremental makeup versus last year"
35,"So from the corporate standpoint, we're going to lose some of the benefit from the operation running much higher"
36,"So underlying operations, we'll see sales up, profits up nicely, margins up"
37,"And we will, I'm telling you right now"
38,", we will be plus or minus flat $0.01 or $0.02, flat from last year's EPS"
39,Our upside and reality based on the order pace we're seeing right now resides in the fourth quarter
40,We did slightly better than our plan in the first quarter
41,We did slightly better than our plan in the second quarter
42,"We've always felt that we'd be kind of flat here in the third quarter, and I mean it because underlying sales will be up but the corporate costs are going to offset that"
43,"And then the upside we see as we look at the fourth quarter, if underlying sales continue to move nicely and we continue to see that margin expansion we should see a pretty good EPS growth, earnings growth in the fourth quarter, giving that range that we talked about most likely in the $2.55 to $2.65 range, looking most likely around that $2.60 range plus or minus $2.62, $2.59."
44,That's where we're looking at right now with a good fourth quarter
45,We had a unique benefit last year in the third quarter around operations
46,But operations right now are starting to see good underlying growth in the 4% to 5% range
47,"Good, where I'd say operating earnings growing up in the 9% to 10%, 11% range, and we have to get through this one quarter here relative to the corporate issues which we face"
48,"So underlying from our perspective right now, the operations are running well and I look for a strong operating quarter"
49,"and then I look for a really good, strong operating quarter in the fourth quarter and a good close to finish the year"
50,So people may think that the numbers aren't moving as rapidly as they want to
51,"but they need to look at behind the curve, and if you see the underlying performance of the company right now it's clearly on a very good path"
52,Our order pattern's very good
53,and we're ahead of what we thought we'd be in February
54,We're ahead of what we've said in the conference call last time
55,"And I feel very good about where we see right now as we go into the second half of the year, as we go into the last quarter of the calendar year and from that momentum standpoint"
56,So that's where we sit at this point in time
57,"The only last comment I would make around the world, as I look at the world because then someone will ask me, I see right now our North America business has continued to improve and we see good growth coming in North America now"
58,Order pattern in North America has been very good and continues to improve
59,I continue to see improvement in China and other parts of Asia
60,Very strong growth in that part based on the product lines and the customer base we have there
61,I see good momentum continuing in Western Europe
62,Eastern Europe and Russia has not really recovered much yet
63,I do not see much recovery at all
64,and I still see negative in Middle East/Africa
65,I still see concerns in Latin America
66,I do not see that recovery happening there at that point in time
67,I'm starting to see some benefit in the early stages of uptake in Canada
68,"So most of the markets that I see right now, driven primarily by U.S"
69,", China, Asia, and Canada, and Western Europe"
70,Those are the markets doing well at this point in time
71,We'll talk a little bit about the valves and controls from the perspective of where we sit at this point in time
72,We've owned it now for three days
73,It's very good to get through
74,We're doing a lot of actions
75,It's very early to tell what we're going to see at this point in time
76,"As we've said back in February, we were going to have some earnings dilution and,"
77,"from that standpoint, we still believe there will still be slightly earnings dilution"
78,We only have five months now versus we're planning on a little bit more time at that point in time
79,"We're probably, at that point, we're probably talking about six or seven months"
80,so it's still earnings dilution
81,"We will try to give more clarity around this as we start analyzing where they stand relative to sales, the profitability, and so forth"
82,"So there's still slightly earnings dilution around the incremental restructuring, some amortization, and that's not different than I've said before"
83,"The one-time purchase accounting which we really are going to have to spend a lot of time on, that number is going to be less than we said before"
84,"I think we told you the price and the backlog, and we look at the purchase accounting it's going to be around $0.25 to $0.30 per share"
85,"It's probably most likely going to be half of that, maybe not quite half of that, but we need four or five months of work on that issue and to get that done"
86,and then we'll come back out and give you some clarity around that
87,"From a cash flow standpoint, given it's only five months, we might have a little bit of positive free cash flow"
88,"It's really relative around how much restructuring we can get done in the next five months, and we're just starting"
89,So we have less cash and less earnings
90,"So, therefore, restructuring might eat up some of the cash flow in the earnings there"
91,but hopefully we'll still have a positive free cash flow for the five months that we own the company
92,"Fundamentally, long-term trend hasn't changed"
93,It's just that we owned it for less
94,We have less time
95,and we've got to get our arms around it
96,"And as soon as I give you some more clarity or I feel I can give you more clarity around it,"
97,I will
98,"but it will be slightly dilutive in earnings per share, actual earnings with the incremental restructuring and the amortization"
99,It will have a one-time hit because of the purchase accounting and then we'll set out the numbers as we go forward
100,But still a very good fundamental deal for us
101,We're acting on it
102,and hopefully the cash flow will be slightly positive for the year when it's all said and done
103,But nothing different there except maybe probably another $0.01 or $0.02 dilutive in the year because we have less time demands from a restructuring standpoint and a benefit standpoint
104,That's where we sit
105,Very excited about it
106,"If any of the valves and controls people are on the phone, we're looking forward to working with you"
107,"It's an exciting acquisition, joining a very strong Automation Solutions business, and we look forward to working with you and with your customer base and our customer base, and really realizing both the growth synergies and some of the opportunity synergies"
108,So really exciting opportunity for us from that perspective
109,"With that, I'll turn it over to the open line and let people ask questions, and feel free to make comments and any questions you want"
110,Question-and-Answer Session
111,Good afternoon
112,"Before I'd make a comment, I'll also make a comment that this might be Rossman's last conference call because I'm looking for a position for him in some place out there"
113,"So if you guys have any ideas, please call me"
114,"But seriously, seriously, he has running his tape and with all the new positions"
115,I'm serious on this
116,His name's in play right now
117,so he may not be on the phone call ever again
118,I might be soloing it with Frank Dellaquila here
119,So that's a real scary thought that Frank and I are going to be doing investor relations with no one to cover for us
120,I forgot to make that comment
121,"And Craig, I know he's laughing"
122,He doesn't know it yet
123,"but his name's in play, and"
124,it's a fun situation
125,"So it might be the last time he'll get to talk to me about this, my friend"
126,"First question, go ahead"
127,He found one already
128,"No, it's not to do with that"
129,It's nothing to do with that
130,It's all about â€
131,“ that's a currency impact from the standpoint
132,â€
133,"“ in the first quarter, we got a benefit"
134,"We have long-term contracts with customers that are priced in dollars and projects and even though the business may not have a lot right now, but we still do, and the way the dollar moves and some of the pricing in these transactions, it's all function"
135,We got a benefit and it went against us this quarter
136,"Next quarter, it could be positive"
137,"That's why, sequentially, they had a problem"
138,"It's nothing to do with operations, not to do with price cost"
139,So it's nothing to do with that
140,It's from a currency which as this business gets too slow from time to time
141,So that's all it is
142,It all works out by end of year typically
143,"Within 12 to 14 months, it all flushes out"
144,That's what the issue is
145,"Operationally, the margins were up"
146,Yeah
147,So it's a good margin for the quarter
148,Yes
149,"I think, in fact, if profitability right now"
150,â€
151,“ so we gave right now from the standpoint â€
152,“ you're talking operating or EBIT margins?
153,So you're talking EBIT margins?
154,So I think these businesses will beat the number
155,"Yeah, it'll be the fourth quarter I think because there's businesses starting to tick up"
156,They're going to have underlying growth in the third quarter
157,The margins come in
158,so my fundamental belief right now is that margin will be better than we presented to you in the Analyst Meeting
159,So right now in the third quarter we're looking at over a point of margin improvement in Automations and
160,probably the fourth quarter we're looking at close to 2.5 to 3 points of margin improvement
161,"Overall, for the year we're looking at over a point"
162,And so we're looking at slightly higher margin than we told you as we go forward here in the rest of this year
163,So they're starting to come forward
164,The tension will be for these guys is where they start investing and from my perspective I want to get back above a 17-plus percent EBIT margin as we finish the year in Automation Solutions
165,So my impression is try to get the midpoint of 17% by the final endpoint of this year for Automation Solutions
166,"So I would expect us to see continued improvement, sequential improvement, and year-over-year improvement in margin in the second half of the year for Automation Solutions"
167,"Yeah, and the answer is yes"
168,"In April, I did tell you that April was stronger orders"
169,North America has continued on a very good pace and recovery
170,"We're starting to see including Canada now, and so Canada has started to pick back up which is a good sign because Canada has been very negative"
171,I still think they'll be negative for the year but that we're actually starting to see that
172,"The points, again, I'll repeat"
173,The place we see the improving strength is U.S
174,", Western Europe, China, the rest of Asia including India, and a little bit of improvement in Canada"
175,I think I've said
176,"But to the rest of places, Latin America, Middle East/Africa, Eastern Europe, and Russia we're not seeing improvements yet but the key core markets have all started trend line very strong and half of the data points have been continued to map along"
177,"Hence, when I made the comment we're above that blue bar that I presented in February, we now have, I think, three months in a row that we're above that blue bar"
178,"And including April which we haven't put out, but that's where I see it right now"
179,"So the trend line is good, the mix of business is good"
180,"But keep in mind, as I've said, in Automation Solutions, as these order pace goes into the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% range, you're starting see more medium-term and longer-term projects get into that mix"
181,"The MRO is still going to be good, but I still have project mix"
182,such that I'm building a good foundation for 2018 at this point in time
183,You're welcome
184,Have a good afternoon
185,"You've got any opportunities for Craig Rossman at Barc, Scott?"
186,What?
187,"You don't want him to work for you, Scott?"
188,Don't give me that BS
189,There's a couple of big differences here for us
190,"One, we are the largest and broadest automation solutions house in the world as you all know right now from the standpoint of the systems, the flow, the measurement, and now the final control"
191,"We are also a business that's very, very global, where we have as much presence in every region in the world"
192,be it Asia
193,", be it in the Americas, be it in Europe, be it in the Middle East and Africa"
194,We are a business that actually had driven off of technology that we can pull into play into the new world somewhere on the digital work at that point in time
195,We're a business that actually have more mechanical and electrical leverage relative to procurement than anybody that's ever owned this business before
196,We are a business that have a customer base and customer reach where they bring a different customer
197,but we also bring a different customer
198,and we are involved in larger projects where we can bid on big projects of $100 million
199,and we can pull all the package along which they could not do before
200,So we actually have a lot more to do both from a cost standpoint
201,"But the most exciting part is from our customer standpoint as we now will have a broader package to offer up in the projects, both medium and large, and then also we can do all the service in the aftermarket which they really didn't have enough critical mass"
202,They're having a good start and I have to give credit to Randy and his team
203,They started this
204,but they just didn't have the critical mass that we have
205,"I mean, if you look at the shift in our business and how we would able to protect our profitability in the downturn, I mean, our business went down just as hard as their business"
206,", maybe theirs is a little bit harder, but we protect our margins"
207,"Our EBIT margins in our automation business bottomed out in, what, in the 15% to 16% range"
208,They got down single-digit
209,"and that's because our aftermarket, what we refer to our KOB 3 business, got up to over 50% of our sales in the downturn"
210,That's the difference
211,"One, is the function of that we actually can support them on the total project, so they have what I refer to as one throat to choke, so they have one player to go after which is Mike Train in the automation space"
212,"And secondly, the service thing and the technology and the on-time delivery"
213,"Those are all very important to us from the standpoint of how we manage our business, and we're much more regional"
214,We play a regional strategy where we manufacture in the region versus more of a let's export-driven strategy
215,"So, yeah, they're very excited about it"
216,"And I'm pretty excited about it, too, if you haven't figured that out"
217,"And if you can think of a good job for Craig, just give me a call, okay?"
218,"I'm looking hard, man"
219,I'm trying hard
220,I'm out there raking the coals right now looking for him
221,Hey
222,The third quarter was an unusual year
223,"If you look at our historical other other income deduction at corporate costs, just look at corporate"
224,"That third quarter last year was very, very low"
225,"It was down in the $40 million range and, historically, we're more in the $60 million to $70 million range"
226,And now this one's going to be higher because we're bringing the valves and control in
227,and we have some of the stock price and things like that
228,So it's a weird comparison
229,"Underlying performance of the company is very, very strong, and the margins are expanding and cash are expanding as we go into it"
230,"I have the big offset, $60 million we have to offset in the third quarter"
231,"I mean, I can't hold my breath and have it go away"
232,Just the bad debt
233,"No, but that's pushed back at the operation level"
234,We pushed that back in there
235,That was the only â€
236,“ Frank?
237,This is the first time I've ever had to tell you on this
238,"I mean, I looked at the numbers"
239,It's the biggest one I've ever seen
240,"Well I think that the North America sales, they hadn't really turned around yet for the whole quarter"
241,And so we started seeing it significantly in March
242,"The other issue people forgot, and if you remember we had a very, very strong fourth calendar quarter or first fiscal quarter this year in Automation Solutions, and a lot of that was that pent-up demand of MRO that came through"
243,and then it did drop off a little bit
244,And now it's starting to come back in a more flowing basis
245,"So we just had a couple of months there that slowed down, and now the MRO is coming in"
246,And the core profitability of the businesses is very good right now
247,and I expect it to continue to be strong and sequentially get better
248,So we're in a sweet spot and the orders now are being fairly consistent from the global markets with five months of pretty good North America orders and things like that
249,I think that it's on a run
250,"Over last year, yes"
251,"I mean, we are a profitable company in Automation Solutions"
252,We actually do run 20% margins
253,"I mean, if you think about it the sales will be up but"
254,from the standpoint they're starting to kick in and how much additional cost we bring back in
255,We're going to time this
256,I want our profitability to get back to some good levels before we bring in too much additional cost
257,A lot of pressure on us right now to put money back in in some technology and things like that
258,I want to get the margins going the right way for our shareholders
259,No
260,"I think I've mentioned to people before on the road, out talking to people"
261,"I expect us to have some quarters just in 15%, 16%"
262,I expect to have some months like that
263,"I would expect us to see, even the rest of this fiscal year, some 10-plus, 15-plus type of orders in certain marketplaces on Automation Solutions"
264,"I mean, if the industry's truly starting to turn back into invest both in, first, the MRO and then into the small projects, then our order pattern should build"
265,"And, I mean, as someone asked me on the road a couple of weeks ago, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have underlying orders from Automation Solutions north of 10% by the time we get into that three-month roll, by the time we get to September"
266,So it's not uncommon and it's coming off a hole
267,"As you well know, we had a couple of quarters there, a couple of years during the up cycle last time where we were growing sales 12%, 15%"
268,So I think it's possible
269,Just as possible to have a negative in a month
270,"I mean, this is a volatile space right now relative to this market turnaround"
271,So I think the trend line is good but don't be surprised with some volatility in a month-to-month type of stuff
272,You win a project you book a price
273,"I mean, yes, projects"
274,"Good afternoon, Julian"
275,We continue to aggressively bid and go after the Automation Solutions acquisitions and also Commercial & Residential
276,"Obviously, we're not successful in one of them"
277,"The intention would be is we still would like to see if we can get $500 million, $0.5 billion of acquisitions"
278,I'm not sure we can at this point in time
279,"We've talked to the board about share repurchase being in the $300 million to $500 million level, and that's where we sit right now"
280,and there's nothing changed in that
281,We're out working acquisitions
282,The opportunities are there and the question will be around is there something that we can land in the next five to six months?
283,"If not, then we're going to probably be driving our share repurchase back into that $300 million to $500 million level"
284,"We've only got, I think, about $100 million this year, correct?"
285,$120 million this year
286,so we have some upside there
287,I still think we're in a price cost window right now
288,that's not good as I've said in the last couple of quarters
289,"I think underlying material inflation, a component to inflation, is the point that's increasing"
290,Our pricing power will solidify as we go through this the next couple of quarters
291,"But as I look at the first quarter we've done, I think we're probably pretty neutral, maybe slightly red"
292,"I don't know, Frank, what the final numbers were"
293,"I would expect as we've just closed this quarter out, we'll be slightly red"
294,I would expect us to be slightly red again
295,This is between price cost in the third quarter
296,And we're pushing pretty hard and hopefully we can close that to neutral to slightly green by the fourth quarter and clear it by the first quarter
297,So we're in that phase right now that we're pushing hard
298,"Material costs are working against us, and so that price cost volume is working"
299,But we've gone through this phase before
300,and I expect by the time we get out of this calendar
301,year
302,our price cost range will be slightly green or neutral
303,So we're back into the sink
304,We've had to offset that pressure with other cost reductions across the company
305,You're welcome
306,Good afternoon
307,There's not a whole lot of big projects going on out there at this point
308,"I mean, there's"
309,small and medium-sized projects and the pricing of those are in line with what we'd expected from a price cost standpoint or margin standpoint
310,There's nothing unusual here at this point in time
311,"The bigger projects will be more late 2017, most likely into 2018, and that would be a more relative time period to really discuss what we see the pricing"
312,"Right now, people are looking for speed, they're looking for trying to execute"
313,"A lot of times, their projects have already been approved"
314,It's already been specced out and awarded
315,Now they're going to dust it off
316,So it's a little bit early stages to see what the pricing is on the big projects
317,"Relative to China, historically I never look beyond 12 months on a surge of growth because then it has a tendency then it sort of swings back"
318,"What explains it is the new technologies we have around our cooling, our air conditioning, and around our refrigeration, and some of the new products and new technologies"
319,And so they're trying to focus relative to the environment and trying to clean air and trying to get rid of some the coal-fired boilers and things like that
320,"We have technology that we had worked with the Chinese government, and those projects are unfolding and we're one of the major suppliers"
321,There's other suppliers but we're one of the major suppliers
322,And the China government has a big focus on this in particularly in the Northern China spot with trying to clean up the pollution and this is going to take a couple of years
323,"My gut tells me that we'll have a big year for 12 months this year, over a 12-month time period"
324,It'll die back a little bit
325,"First of all, the comparison will be tougher but the programs are not going to die when we get into 2018."
326,There will be just less of an impact coming off obviously a higher base
327,"But right now, it looks like the projects will continue but the growth rates will slow but it'll still be at high levels"
328,"Good afternoon, Deane"
329,"We had cleaned up some of the receivable base and asset base last year with the continued deterioration of what we saw in Venezuela, and this is before even things happened with the GM situation here"
330,We got to assume we're not going to get anything back from these assets
331,and we decided just to take care of it
332,"Yeah, that's all there is"
333,"Well the power industry is investing in upgrading from around, if you think about some of the gas industry, you think about using less coal, they're looking at some of the new technologies to allow the plants to run more efficiently with some of the changes coming out of the EPA"
334,I think this will continue to work nicely for us in the North American marketplace
335,"And we're seeing continued power investments throughout Asia Pacific, and even parts of Eastern Europe are seeing some power investments"
336,"Now, life sciences have gone through a period here where, if you follow the life science marketplace, we're seeing and have been now for over 12 months an investment period where they're bringing new drugs in, they're bringing new facilities in"
337,"and there we get, obviously"
338,", the control systems"
339,We get some instrumentation and that's been one of the bigger project areas for us and we're doing quite well there
340,"Now there's smaller type of projects but they're still good projects and so we're seeing that investment both in Europe, in North America, and"
341,"we're seeing a lot of investments going on in Asia, both in India, Southeast Asia, and also China as they're all trying to create their own life science pharmaceutical industry"
342,They've only had it for a little while
343,"I mean, I don't think anything is going to happen there for a while"
344,"Historically, I would say it'd be a couple of years before anything happens there"
345,I think something will happen relative to our Artisan investment before Network Power because that's been getting close to four or five years now
346,So nothing there
347,"I mean, I wouldn't expect anything out of those guys yet"
348,Well we don't get any contribution
349,We don't get any earnings or sales off of that
350,If they do something well with it
351,You're welcome
352,"Good afternoon, Jeff"
353,No
354,I don't have any idea
355,I have no freaking idea
356,No
357,"I mean, no"
358,"I mean, maybe you (43:03) but"
359,no
360,How they performed?
361,"Look, I mean, I know where they are relative to sales"
362,I know a little bit of the orders
363,I know that profitability is down
364,"but they've been in disc ops now for, what, eight months"
365,"So from my perspective, I'm looking at from May 1 on"
366,", that's where I'm caring about"
367,and we're working it hard
368,So we'll talk about that
369,I think that the timing is going to be pretty good because I think within a couple of quarters we'll start seeing some improvement in orders and stuff like that because the marketplace is starting to turn
370,"I think it's going to be slightly dilutive for both quarters on just pure earnings basis, excluding the one-time accounting changes which we'll have to start booking in the third quarter"
371,"So most likely, we'll have a one-time booking in the third quarter"
372,We might have to true it up a little bit in the fourth quarter as we get more knowledge on it
373,"But the underlying earnings, I mean, it's going to be a little bit in the third and a little bit in the fourth"
374,"I mean, this is something that takes a little time and this is something we could not actually do that we had to stay away from it"
375,And so it's really easy for us to look at earnings and look at what we have to charge from an interest cost or a charge from amortization and things like that or intangible
376,We can figure those things out pretty quickly
377,The inventory and the backlog will take us several months
378,"I mean, we'll take an estimate in the third quarter and we'll take another estimate in the fourth"
379,"And hopefully by the time we get at the end of the calendar year, we'll get everything trued up"
380,"The OIOD we have in there for that piece, and we'll have some more, is basically deal costs"
381,"It's paying costs of doing this deal, legal fees, and banker fees, other things like that we've had tied to that"
382,"Now that we've closed the deal, we can run through the P&L and we'll have some more running in the fourth quarter, too"
383,"There is nothing in there other than what we have that we, Emerson, expended in getting this deal closed"
384,"I mean, we're working on it our self"
385,"and we'll work on it for you, too"
386,"But the banking fees, we'll call out"
387,"I mean, we'll have some more in the fourth quarter"
388,We'll do the same thing
389,"But, I mean, I'm in the third quarter"
390,Third quarter
391,So we'll keep you informed and they will be delta'd out obviously unless we have some other transaction going on
392,You won't have that impact next year
393,I'm not trying to wrap around anything
394,"Good afternoon, Rob"
395,"I mean, by telling you the EPG I'll have weeks"
396,"So I'll give a sense for a little bit of the business, okay?"
397,And so what's going on inside the business?
398,And right now we have a lot of work going on trying to bring the two businesses together
399,and that's far more important than pulling together stuff to put on a chart
400,"Relative to the inventory, relative to the backlog, that information will take us several months, several quarters to finalize"
401,"Relative to what we see from the P&L, the sales, and the earnings, then I think we'll have a better feel"
402,I can give you a little bit better range after three weeks
403,So that one we could do
404,"The big number which is the one-time accounting impact, we're going to take our first stab at that relative to the third fiscal quarter when we closed it, and I told you it's going to be a little bit less than I told you in the chart we gave you in February"
405,"and, hopefully, we can get that down even further as we get through it"
406,"But it's a function of what the inventory looks like, a function of backlog, and those are things that we have to get in and do all evaluations on"
407,"On the big projects we can work with, from the countries that struggled with and concerns with, you call it blacklist"
408,and I call it sometimes the customer is not quite accepting some of them
409,", we can work that issue"
410,"We, obviously, have great relationships and we have a very strong Middle East business, we have a very strong Eastern European and Russian business"
411,We have manufacturing on all of those sites
412,"From our perspective right now, we're starting to bid"
413,"In fact, the Pentair team allowed us to bid on several large projects even before we owned them, and when we bid and won on the total package"
414,So we're going to continue to bring them into market
415,They were not maybe very welcomed in or strong and our organization is very strong globally
416,"We have better customer relationships and we have access to the big projects because of it being driven by systems or control or whatever it is, we can go in and talk to customers"
417,So I think that's going to be something that we can work pretty quickly over a two-year time period and get them back and engage
418,But we need to work on the regionalization of manufacturing that supply base so they can make sure they can deliver quickly in support of the projects we're winning
419,"I mean, I don't think the ship's completely sailed on the Automations Solutions"
420,I think there are opportunities out there
421,We're always working on projects and maybe some of the big ones that won't happen
422,But there are projects out there all of the time that you can work on
423,and we're working on
424,several right now
425,"The Commercial & Residential, I think that we'll continue to focus on the application, the software, and the measurement sensoring side of the business which really is core to us to deliver what we're calling the sort of the Plantweb of the Commercial & Residential area which is the industrial internet space"
426,So there's some unique assets out there
427,Nothing of what I would say are large
428,"A large deal there could be $600 million, $700 million"
429,But I think that we're going to continue to buy some software and sensor-based acquisitions there and continue to integrate
430,"The business, as you well know, is doing well right now"
431,"We're in the mix of a major global upgrade, an upgrade in investment, in the capital and delivery capabilities of that business"
432,"We're starting to see some, as you could see from the profitability standpoint, Bob and his team are doing a good job of leveraging that new cost structure"
433,and I think we still have opportunities here for the rest of this year going into next year
434,I think the opportunities are out there for us; it's just a matter of finding the right ones and then getting them on board
435,There'll be typically less competition in that space
436,I'm glad to hear that
437,Where's Tusa?
438,Who's got the fleece?
439,Is it Tusa?
440,"Happy afternoon, Rich"
441,"Since you've got Wells Fargo, it's got a big position here in St"
442,"Louis, got any opportunity for Craig?"
443,"I'd tell you what, I'm not getting a whole lot of warmth here for Craig"
444,"I mean, there's not a lot of love here for you"
445,"I mean, I might have to (53:11)"
446,"I mean, I thought Rich liked you"
447,I thought he was looking for a beer man to hold the beer for him
448,"I mean, I don't think I've ever seen that before in a game"
449,I didn't believe I heard it at first
450,"Go ahead, Rich"
451,"Still a bit early there, Rich"
452,"I mean, as you know I watch this pretty closely and that's why I can give you sort of the background, the color into it"
453,"I'm already starting to see some of the projects that had been shelved and iced two or three years ago come back out, those medium, small projects"
454,"So in the early stages, as you saw the orders pick back up, we're starting to see the book-to-ship in that base business pretty quick"
455,"And so my feeling right now as I see that order mix, and that change is as we've shift into order, positive growth's going to be there"
456,"But let's say their order pattern is going to be around the 6%, 7% underlying growth rate"
457,I think they're going to be more in the 3% to 4% real sales growth
458,I think as they start building that backlog
459,But give me another couple of months to watch this
460,So that's what I see right now and that tells me that then we'll go into some good medium-sized projects
461,The MRO is still going to be there
462,"but it's going to make up the core growth rate of, say, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and then as we start getting stronger growth in Automation, that will be those medium projects"
463,"And the bigger projects will start booking in 2018, late 2017, and we'll start getting those sales late 2018, early 2019."
464,So it's a little early to say the mix
465,I expect those guys to have a pretty good margin assuming the MRO and the order book leads the year
466,like I think it could lead the year
467,We should have a pretty good margin in the first half of 2018 as we go into 2018.
468,Keep asking the question because I'll get more visibility as I get into it
469,"I mean, I won't get it in the next two or three weeks"
470,"But I'll tell you what, by the time I get into June I'll have a better visibility on this"
471,Last year's third quarter was not good
472,"So we're going to have a very solid mid-single-digit, a higher than 5 mid-single-digit growth based on what I think is going to happen in the third quarter for the Commercial & Residential"
473,It will then be lower for a couple of reasons in the fourth quarter
474,"It'll still be good, in my opinion, in the fourth quarter"
475,"One, if you look at the fourth quarter last year, they grew a little bit over 4.5%, about 4.5% underlying sales"
476,China started picking up at that point in time and we saw some pretty good U.S
477,So I would say we're going to have a very solid upper mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter
478,and then we're going to have a solid lower than 5% growth in the fourth quarter
479,That's what I see right now
480,You're exactly right
481,"What are we seeing, $50 million?"
482,"$25 million Pentair, Rich"
483,Yeah
484,Where's my sweater vest guy here?
485,"See here, somebody said I had to bring a sweater vest to go someplace"
486,I don't know where I'm going
487,"I mean, you're telling me is going to be cold up there"
488,I need a sweater vest
489,And the only guy I know that has a sweater vest is Steve Tusa
490,Are they building a new headquarters up there?
491,"I mean, I've heard there's a lot of headquarters being built up in that region up there"
492,"Tusa, that's a great idea"
493,Note to self
494,I did not make the comment that we're investing those away
495,"As you know, I still think we have margin ability to get this to 25% as we work the press (58:48) issues"
496,"I mean, the comment I want to throw in there is that as you know this industry, and you know this industry pretty well, Steve, there are some major changes coming in here, refrigerants and some efficiency standards relative to both in North America and in Europe that we need to make sure that we stay ahead of our customer base"
497,And so we're making sure those investments are happening
498,You can't miss a quarter or two in that
499,I'm not talking about lowering our profitability margins
500,"I just want to make sure that people, as they see the last couple of quarters or the last couple of years, they've seen pretty good margin improvement there"
501,I just want to make sure that they realize that we're going to still have margin improvements in this business in the next couple of years
502,"but I've got to make sure we're also investing on this transition that's going to unfold in 2018, 2019, and 2020."
503,"We need to make sure that we take advantage of that and pick up some incremental business, incremental share, in that marketplace"
504,He definitely barely made it over the blue line and he doesn't have a whole lot of hop-back
505,He's now the oldest King Charles Spaniel at 15 years in St
506,So he's doing well
507,"but, boy, I tell you what don't ask him to go up the steps anymore"
508,"Steve, it's going to be Automation Solutions"
509,"As you well know, in the Commercial & Residential, the one wildcard we have here is heat in north in the U.S"
510,"It was a bad year last year, so comparisons will be pretty easy"
511,but there's an element of risk in that area
512,"I think the underlying housing, the underlying basic core spending, Commercial & Residential is good around the world"
513,So that's the one wildcard
514,I still think that they're going to have pretty good orders in the mid-single digits
515,The Automation Solutions will be the driver
516,"I mean, as I've said, we put the blue band out and, obviously, we've now had three months above that blue band"
517,"I think we'll continue to move on, go through the mid-single digits, probably get into 6%, 7%, 8%, but it's going to be driven by Automation Solutions"
518,"And so right now, as I look at North America, I look at Asia which is starting to recover, as I look at some of these marketplaces, I would not be surprised, as I've said earlier, that Automation Solutions orders are not 10-plus percent in the fourth quarter on a cumulative basis"
519,That will pull all of these up unless there's a huge drop off of Commercial & Residential
520,"We also start, as you well know, comparison in more challenging numbers in Commercial & Residential in that fourth quarter"
521,"But the trend line's pretty strong right now and if I look at the global GFI numbers, they're improving and have been improving"
522,So the cycle's going right for us right now
523,"And, Steve, thank you very much"
524,And I hope you know I'm just kidding you on the sweater vest
525,I just like to pick on somebody and since you happen to be on the phone I had to pick on you
526,"You have hair, he doesn't"
527,I didn't say that
528,See you later
529,Good afternoon
530,Good afternoon
531,"I mean, right now Saudi, from an order standpoint, is the best of the best"
532,I think the rest of the marketplace is pretty weak
533,"So, I mean, we're very much project business-driven there"
534,So I would say right now Saudi has the best light for us
535,Kuwait is doing well
536,That's another one that's doing well
537,But those are the two that we see right now
538,"So from our business standpoint, there's not a lot of big activity going on"
539,"It's primarily MRO, small stuff, and the business is basically â€"
540,“ They think they're going to go with flat; I think they're going to be down for the year
541,So that's what I see at this point in time
542,No
543,Our Middle Eastern customers have always paid us
544,They pay us on time
545,"Our business, our products are kind of instrumental to running the plants"
546,"And so if they can't turn the plant on because they didn't pay me, sometimes it's a problem for them"
547,The Europeans are driving it
548,It's being driven very hard by the Siemens (1:04:56) ABB in a big way
549,We have continued to expand on the hybrid and on the discrete side
550,So we'll continue to do that
551,"I mean, that's why I show the charts"
552,We show the charts that we move across that way
553,And we'll continue to buy
554,That was a very nice acquisition from New York
555,"And so from that perspective, I understand where they're going from it"
556,and it's the same strategy we have ourselves
557,So I'd like to wrap it up
558,I want to thank everybody for your time today
559,"Appreciate the questions and, hopefully, I didn't upset too many people with having fun with them a little bit"
560,But I am serious
561,"Craig, as we're looking at Craig moving on to his next assignment and it will be inside Emerson, it will be something important"
562,And then Frank and I will probably be covering for him because he did not do a good job at developing a successor which is something I'm really upset about
563,but we'll take care of that in his bonus
564,"But with that, I thank everybody and look forward to seeing everybody down at EPG"
565,And I'll make sure I take a sweater when I go to Boston later this month
