16,High growth markets accelerated to high single-digit growth in the quarter driven primarily by China and improved results in Latin America partially offset by challenging Middle East markets
17,"North American growth of low single-digits was driven primarily by strong performance at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Matco, Fluke and Kollmorgen"
18,Western Europe growth of high single-digits continues to reflect outperformance to the general macro environment as market share gains were realized across both professional instrumentation and industrial technology segments
19,"As we guided last quarter, we use the outperformance in third quarter of 2016 to invest opportunistically back in our businesses in the form of both long-term growth and productivity investments"
20,"Even with those additional investments, we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter demonstrating the value of FBS and focused execution"

31,Sell-through data continues to improve in both regions
32,The integration of eMaint Enterprises continues to go well and weâ€
33,™ve seen positive customer reaction as we launch combined offerings to provide our Fluke Condition Monitoring Solution
34,"eMaint held a customer conference in November, where customers have the ability to preview the new integrated solutions to improve productivity of labor resources, increase equipment up time and increase asset life via shifted predictive maintenance"
35,"We were overwhelmed by the number of customers eager to be early adopters, and while itâ€™s still early days on the commercialization front, the sales funnel expanded approximately 30% in January versus December"
36,Weâ€™ll continue to keep you updated on this important growth driver for both Fluke and Fortive
37,The Fluke team continues to innovate and expand the Fluke connected tool box as evidenced by the recent release of the Ti480 Infrared Camera
38,The Ti480 introduces 640 by 480 resolution into a ruggedized pistol grip form factor to maintenance professionals across a variety of vertical markets
39,Weâ€™ve seen incredible traction with this camera during itâ€™s first six weeks on the market and are excited about itâ€™s growth prospects going forward
40,Qualitrolâ€™s high-single digit growth marks itâ€™s eleventh consecutive quarter of positive core growth
41,Demand continues to be driven by utility customers in high growth markets particularly the Middle East and APAC regions where we continue to gain share with OEMs.
42,The Qualitrol team has made important progress executing their condition based monitoring strategy
43,And leveraging itâ€™s broad offering to customers clearly FBS has played a critical role in improving funnel visibility and marketing identification
44,"Moving to product realization the platform, core revenues were down low-single digits this quarter reflecting project timing of PacSci EMC and Invetech"
45,"For the year, these two businesses grew at low-single digit rates"
46,Given the nature of these project based businesses itâ€™s not unexpected to see variation in growth quarter to quarter
47,We do have good line of sight into the backlog at PacSci EMC and Invetech and we expect continued low single digit growth trajectory forward
48,Tektronix reported low-single digit core revenue growth during the quarter reflecting continued outperformance in China of high-double digits and stabilization in developed markets
49,China growth remains to be driven by the conductor semiconductor and communications segments where we continue to gain market share with our industry leading technology
50,In North America weâ€™re seeing signs of stabilization
51,But no signs of recovery in the computer and semiconductor segment
52,"The military, government and educational sectors continue to perform well here"
53,and we see tremendous traction with our 70 gigahertz real time Oscilloscope particularly within data centers
54,Our Sensing Technologies platform posted high-single digit core growth in the quarter
55,The controls end markets continue to be challenged partially offsetting strong outperformance in our sensor businesses where we saw new key account wins globally and increased demand for our MRO products in North America
56,"Moving to our industrial technology segment, we realized core revenue growth of 5.6% in quarter"
57,"Acquisitions contributed approximately 130 basis points of growth relative to prior year, which was partially offset by a 100 basis points of unfavorable currency translation"

60,"During the fourth quarter, we experienced a headwind from the EMV related indoor point-of-sale solutions that was more than offset by an increase in outdoor EMV related demand for both dispensers and payment kits"
61,The November 2016 announcement regarding the outdoor liability shift in the U.S
62,"to 2020 did not have an impact on our fourth quarter results as most customers had already ordered before year end, consistent with their capital spend budgets"
63,Looking forward we donâ€™t expect the delay to affect the total incremental outdoor EMV opportunity that we previously outlined
64,And we continue to believe that this is a three to four year opportunity
65,"Net, net we view the 2020 timeline as a positive as it reduces our customerâ€™s near term liability and also because we expect the incremental outdoor EMV impact will be more evenly distributed over the next several years"
66,Telematics realized core growth of low-single digits in the quarter with most of the growth stemming from outside the U.S
67,Director our new SaaS platform continues to gain traction and weâ€™re encouraged by our record high installed base in the United States
68,Weâ€™re further encouraged by the recent ELD or Electronic Logging Device decision that clears the way for ELD adoption by the transportation industry beginning in 2017.
69,"Automation and specialty components posted mid-single digit, core revenue growth in the quarter"
70,Automation growth was offset by core revenue decline in Jacobs Vehicle Systems which was impacted by the challenged North American heavy truck market
71,Within automation Kollmorgen and Thomson both grew core revenues high-single digits
72,"Thomsonâ€™s growth was driven by distribution, medical equipment, and off-highway vertical markets"
73,This is Kollmorgenâ€™s third consecutive quarter of growth and was reflective of outperformance in both developed and high growth markets driven primarily by targeted efforts in the medical robotics and metal-forming verticals
74,"Kollmorgenâ€™s use the speed design review help them execute their robotic strategy to address secular growth in collaborative robotics and they grew revenue strong double digits in China in 2016, as a result of their FBS commercial growth tools"
75,These are just a couple of examples of how our businesses leverage FBS to drive growth and outperform their markets
76,"Moving to franchise distribution, which posted low-single digit growth for the quarter, Iâ€™m happy to share that once again Matco grew revenue at a high-single digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same store sales and franchise apps"
77,"Matco Expo, Matcoâ€™s largest franchise event of the year is in the first quarter of 2017 and we are anticipating record attendance of almost 10% over the prior year"
78,Matcoâ€™s mid-single digit or better core revenue growth track record is now 26 out of the last 28 quarters
79,"To wrap up, we have a strong finish in the fourth quarter contributing to a solid start for Fortive"
80,As I had alluded to before the reinvigoration of our culture was evident as the Fortive Business System drove both core top line and earnings out performance while allowing for investment in the future
81,Our excellent cash flow performance combined with our strong balance sheet leaves us well positioned for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market leading positions in 2017.
82,"We are initiating our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes assumptions for low-single digit core revenue growth, amidst stable end markets"
83,"Combined with the benefits of our additional restructuring and growth investments this past quarter, as well as decreased amortization"
84,we anticipate core margin expansion in excess of 50 basis points with an effective tax rate of 28% for the year
85,"In 2017, we expect currency to be approximate headwind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points to the top line and $0.05 to EPS"
86,"As you can see from the waterfall in the slides, we expect productivity and restructuring benefits to provide a $0.04 to $0.05 tailwind and low-single digit core revenue growth at a 30% to 35% fall through to contribute $0.04 to $0.13."
87,Our resulting 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.60 to $2.70 implies growth of 7% at the high-end of the guidance
88,"We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.54 to $0.58, which also includes an assumption of low-single digit core revenue growth"
89,"In closing I want to say how proud I am of our 24,000 employees for all that weâ€™ve accomplished in this milestone year"
90,Iâ€™m looking forward to Fortiveâ€™s first full year as a standalone company
91,"Fortiveâ€™s culture of FBS and accountability will serve our customers and you, our shareholder as well as we live our values and work every day to deliver essential technology for the people who accelerate progress"
92,Weâ€™re committed to making 2017 another great year
93,"With that, Iâ€™d like to turn it over to Lisa"
94,Thanks Steve
95,"I think first of all, M&A continues to be our main priority"
96,so no change in that
97,"We think today, we have about $3 billion worth of capacity over the next couple of years"
98,And so weâ€™ve got plenty of opportunity
99,"As we mentioned on prior calls really a number of things have been happening in relative to building our own capacity, couple deals that weâ€™ve got done in the third quarter as we mentioned on the prior call"
100,Nothing this quarter but certainly weâ€™re very busy
101,and I think we are very fortunate to be in a position we are at right now from a balance sheet perspective
102,Iâ€™m highly confident we will get some things done in 2017 with a breadth of deals both from a size perspective and across the platforms
103,"Yes, I wouldnâ€™t say pricing has been an issue at all I think"
104,"at the end of the day, weâ€™ve been very much â€“ weâ€™ve been active and I think we havenâ€™t seen much change in pricing over the last 12 months"
105,"Yes, mostly I think the other $0.02 on growth was mostly in PI I think, Steve as it translated we were able to accelerate a number of things around condition monitoring, some things we want to do on the new platform to tack as well as a couple of incremental investments in other parts of the portfolio"
106,So that just gives you a sense of both the restructuring and the growth
107,"Okay, we will take that in a short answer but certainly as we talk to a number of customers weâ€™ve been out"
108,"I think there is not a real change at this point with anyoneâ€™s out look at this point, lot moving around and most customers are really started waiting to really understand if thereâ€™s difference from a policy perspective that are actually going to be enacted"
109,So I would say its still very early days we note at the stabilization in the North American market from really the third to the fourth being pretty consistent
110,so no real uptick and nor is there one plant in our guide
111,"Thank you, Steve"
112,"The R&D, the 6.1 weâ€™ve been right around there, up or down 10 basis points and now you expect this to be there, when you click down by opco thereâ€™s going to be some changes this projects ebb and flow but"
113,no real changes to our R&D from â€
114,“ we want to change the investment level
115,So its just the normal place
116,"The big thing thatâ€™s going on in terms of SG&A is the growth investments we put in, in the second half of the year as we saw the top line strengthening"
117,we kicked off a little bit more investment
118,and we really called out some of that in the third quarter when we overachieved in the third quarter so weâ€™re going to even put a little bit more to try and accelerate and help us out next year
119,"Scott, we think of it in a couple of ways first the guide doesnâ€™t assume any M&A"
120,And so whether you are getting into high single-digits without the benefit of deploying using our balance sheet is what weâ€™ve been really consistently saying and we feel pretty good about that
121,"Having said that, as Jim said we expect to deploy some M&A and thatâ€™s the thing I think is going to take our â€"
122,“ that I expect to take our earnings growth up over the next year or two
123,Thanks Scott
124,"Yes, we can"
125,"Nigel, maybe just a little bit of color, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, regionally we expect sort of the U.S"
126,and kind of the developed markets to be â€
127,"“ what I would say relatively stable in that kind of low single-digit range, will probably get a little bit uptick in the high growth markets above that, maybe mid single-digits and the high growth markets for the year"
128,So thatâ€™s kind of our thought here
129,We donâ€™t anticipate any big shift in any of the markets
130,"Relative to operating company, certainly weâ€™re seeing a little bit better growth in places like Fluke that we expect, in automation, Kollmorgenâ€™s three quarters in a row, track record is pretty good â€"
131,"“ is obviously very good, weâ€™re very pleased with that"
132,And then some of the perennial folks like Matco and Gilbarco will continue to do well
133,But I think itâ€™s a very balanced approach to growth
134,"I think as we think about it, both regionally as well as within â€“ as Chuck mentioned in the segments and certainly as you drill down in the operating companies, pretty balanced as well"
135,"Still a little noisy at Tektronix, particularly in the developed markets,"
136,"theyâ€™re doing an outstanding job in their high growth markets, particularly in China as we noted on the prepared remarks, but we still think Tek is going to be a little noisy in the first half"
137,Thanks Nigel
138,Good afternoon
139,Thanks Julian
140,"Hi, Jeff"
141,So the fourth quarter performance was really more of a story of just them blocking and tackling well
142,The high-growth market is doing very well
143,"China, India, number of those markets doing well"
144,"So there really was not as much an innovation story, thatâ€™s really to come"
145,"I think we highlighted that they have a new platform coming out in the second half of the year, which weâ€™re really excited about"
146,We think it will deliver some increased revenue for sure
147,"And we just passed a major milestone on that platform here a couple of weeks ago, so it gives us even more confidence that launch is going to be on time in the second half and that will start a series of new products over the next several years"
148,"So itâ€™s not just sort of one big launch in the second half, but really office platform that will keep a level of innovation in the marketplace that weâ€™re excited about"
149,So the tech team is doing â€
150,“ I think weâ€™ll see a little bit choppy first half
151,I think they will probably be okay in the first quarter because theyâ€™re little bit easier comp in the first quarter as well
152,But I think as we get to the second half weâ€™
153,ll see improved performance
154,Unidentified Analyst In a similar vein in terms of kind of growth initiatives maybe update us a little bit on the Fluke Connect
155,"You mentioned it in your opening script, but how that is progressing maybe the size of the business at this point if you would like to share with any other color around that"
156,When we launched the condition â€
157,“ we have the Fluke Connect tools out for a few years
158,"and then just as we mentioned on the new infrared camera, this is the launch of another connected tool which is great"
159,So that level of innovation weâ€™ve continued into the marketplace
160,The condition monitoring solution that will certainly highlight at the Investor Conference as well
161,"Weâ€™ll give you a sense of that, but that really got launched in the fourth quarter"
162,"Early days as I mentioned that combined with the eMate suite, software suite that will be an integrated solution here shortly"
163,And weâ€™re seeing a lot of dual selling thatâ€™s able to happen with the team relative to the getting sales leads and building funnel
164,"But itâ€™s still fairly early days, not a lot of revenue yet"
165,I think one thing the sales cycles a little bit longer
166,This is a SaaS-based solution
167,So it takes a little bit longer to get the customer to think through that
168,"So I think weâ€™re probably not going to see meaningful revenue to the second half, as we work through the lead gen, work through the funnel"
169,and then obviously you need to build momentum with SaaS-based business before it starts to bring the cash register
170,"So we â€“ itâ€™s really probably a second half even in the 2018 kind of story, but weâ€™ll â€“ weâ€™re very â€“itâ€™s still"
171,early days
172,"I said in the prepared remarks, but I think weâ€™re in a very good place relative to the solution and the way customers are really understanding and getting to understand the solutions"
173,"Unidentified Analyst Great, thank you"
174,"Maybe just a final note on that â€“ weâ€™ve got about that the target market on that is about 600,000 manufacturing sites around the world where they really, really donâ€™t have a solution today and can really easily install the solution for a low, with a very low interest costs and ability to upsell them with new features over time"
175,"So it takes a little while to get out of those places and get the lead generation engine going, but weâ€™re â€“ weâ€™ve started and Iâ€™m very â€"
176,“ Iâ€™ve got great optimism here
177,"Unidentified Analyst Great, thank you"
178,"Hi, Rick"
179,"And maybe this is a final point, even though we did have a little bit more price at Gilbarco on the quarter, we had excellent gross margin in performance in the quarter"
180,"So one of the things we look at the combination of pricing gross margin is probably part of your question Rick, is to make sure that even if weâ€™re giving up a little price, sometimes weâ€™re giving price on maybe higher software or something that inevitably brings higher gross margins in the portfolio anyway"
181,"And in this case even with that price, we are able to as you pointed out to deliver excellent gross margins"
182,I think at this point it still price in FBS
183,"I mean that we really do as you know, we drive businesses really hard on a regular basis around continuous improvement on gross margins"
184,Price is an FBS tool and we utilize it in every business every year
185,So those are just kind of standard work in our businesses
186,If our SaaS and software today its 4%
187,Those businesses were up about â€“up double digit
188,"I think if we look at all those collective offerings in the quarter, but itâ€™s still a small part of the business"
189,"Itâ€™s really going to take a little while for that, that to really be a meaningful impact"
190,"And that part of our confidence whenever we get the question about our ability to drive gross margins over time, itâ€™s not only the power of FBS, but itâ€™s also the business mix that we can see over the next four or five years that coming at us"
191,It should accelerate
192,I think the marketâ€™s growing
193,I think as we pointed out last couple of quarters that our non-U.S
194,business has been exceptionally good
195,"We added in the fourth quarter double-digit units into the portfolio, but because of a variety of different things that we needed to do relative to some customers they didnâ€™t necessarily, it doesnâ€™t necessarily transition in the quarter right, because it SaaS takes a number of quarters to play out"
196,So we think that this certainly can be the markets growing in the U.S
197,mid to high-single digits and in some segments even higher than that
198,So we really believe
199,Weâ€™ve launched this new director platform as we mentioned in the prepared remarks and weâ€™re excited about it
200,We need to get it more pervasively through our installed base
201,And we think once thatâ€™s more in with more customers are opportunity to change the trajectory that growth rate is pretty good as we move throughout 2017.
202,Thanks
203,Hi Shannon
204,"Yes, I think our instincts, right, as we said we really wouldnâ€™t know what the rollout would be"
205,I think our instincts would tell us right now
206,I know itâ€™s not as much customer conversations as it is instinct havenâ€™t been in the industry for 20 years
207,Our instincts tell us will be a little bit of a pause here for customers as they think about the rollout strategy
208,That will be months and quarters not years
209,So but â€“ and thatâ€™s why we think we come off a little bit of that 100 basis points maybe a little bit less than 100 basis points
210,"But those are the upside of that is â€“ as they probably a better curve in terms of rollout, and as you mentioned we think probably less kits and more dispensers"
211,"So probably, as we get to mid-year, weâ€™ll have a better sense of that, where we remodel it every month, but I think our model will be more accurate"
212,"And at that point, weâ€™ll have a better sense for the market opportunity"
213,But I think we always knew that there was probably going to be some level of push out
214,and this really is probably mostly good news for us relative to how the next several years are
215,look
216,One is that some expansion in resources around sales force around the world
217,The business just is doing great globally
218,Thatâ€™s number one
219,"And in a couple of acquisitions, we did several years ago that gave us that can some of the products from a condition monitoring perspective that are driving some growth as well"
220,So there â€
221,"“ the team is done and thatâ€™s the growth flywheel that we talk about metaphorically, so often about how acquisitions even small ones could accelerate growth in mid-size businesses and we think that that opportunity exists in a number of places in the portfolio"
222,Thank you
223,"Yes, I think the core growth as weâ€™re talking about a slow single digit, but we do have an easier compare in Q1."
224,So itâ€™s probably going to the higher end of that range in Q1.
225,"And then I think that the EPS split as it goes through the year, weâ€™re still learning as we go here, but itâ€™s going to be something like 22, 26 â€"
226,"“ 26, 28 if I get the numbers"
227,That probably didnâ€™t adequately
228,But itâ€™s in those rangeâ€¦
229,"Yes, they had a strong quarter, again the team is really executing well"
230,"Theyâ€™re continuing expand franchises, which really drives growth"
231,We really kind of make sure that same-store sales are good
232,I suspect there was a little bit annoyed and
233,"if we went month to month, but as we really roll up the quarter, it was still very good"
234,"So I think at this point, what weâ€™re seeing right now with a combination of just wonderful attendance rate at our expo here in a couple of weeks as well as a good start"
235,I think weâ€™re still going to be in that mid to high single-digit range for a while now
236,Theyâ€™re doing a great job
237,"As weâ€™ve said and I know this is, FBS is really just one of our â€“ from a growth perspective, is one of our best businesses for deploying FBS and our â€“ in from a growth perspective"
238,So theyâ€™ll continue to do that
239,And I think will continue to perform well
240,"Nothing yet, I think weâ€™ve been number of things that weâ€™re doing actively have been going on for a little while"
241,"I donâ€™t necessarily get a sense that anyoneâ€™s holding up for doing anything, because of waiting for Washington to do anything"
242,"And obviously, our discussions are global as well"
243,"So between the various things that go on both from a macroeconomic perspective in a geopolitical situation, youâ€™ve got a number of elections in Europe as well, which provide some uncertainty and usually uncertainty is a good thing, so for M&A"
244,So I think all those things roll up to
245,I think a pretty good environment right now
246,And as I mentioned before the bit out they havenâ€™t changed radically
247,So I â€
248,“ thatâ€™s what gives me confidence
249,say I know weâ€™ll do some deals here in 2017.
250,"Thanks, have a great evening"
251,"Yes, sure"
252,"I think, one we donâ€™t have a lot of CapEx businesses in China"
253,So weâ€™re really fortunate to have things that are more related operating expense kinds of things
254,"Weâ€™re certainly getting the benefit of the secular trend in Tektronix, where they really well positioned themselves over the years to take advantage of a lot of the semiconductor and communication expansion thatâ€™s going there and theyâ€™re doing exceptionally well"
255,So thatâ€™s in our â€“ certainly in our number and really have to do with â€
256,“ it really isnâ€™t a macro point
257,I think we go around the rest of the portfolio though weâ€™re continuing to see strength with a number of our OEMs that our automation team has partnerships with in our cultural business has and our food business is done pretty well as well
258,So we had â€
259,“ we just had an exceptional fourth quarter
260,I donâ€™t necessarily think that the strength that weâ€™ve seen is necessarily what happened all of 2017.
261,But we still feel very bullish on what China look like next year and think itâ€™ll outpace our overall growth rate next year
262,"Not really, not really â€“ itâ€™s still"
263,"early right, you could never call China until about March, because of the new year in particularly the way the new year was position this year"
264,So it is the â€“ having run China for a long time
265,I generally try not to make any predictions and so well into March
266,Thatâ€™s mostly a North America and a little bit of China comment
267,Their positions are pretty niche
268,So it really is market share gains for them and business with that size
269,a few big market share wins really makes a big difference
270,"Hey, Andy"
271,Youâ€™re exactly right
272,Thanks for calling out my inability to forecast the geography
273,"But clearly I think what we saw, some really good performance with some work that weâ€™ve been doing like at Kollmorgen on collaborative robots where they have a number of strong customers in Europe"
274,And the number of businesses as well that are really more secular driven than any macro
275,"And that continued in the quarter, but we donâ€™t think that that will continue"
276,You mentioned some of the geopolitical risk
277,I think we â€
278,“ Chuck and I would say that that does exist
279,Weâ€™re monitoring it to understand it
280,and we do think that Western Europe will moderate through the balance â€“ through 2017.
281,"But we still think it will grow, we still think its probably at least a low single digit grower right now"
282,and it might be a little bit more noisy month to month
283,and maybe even quarter to quarter
284,because of what we just described on the election cycle
285,But I still think given our positions and what weâ€™ve been doing from an execution perspective
286,", we feel good that we can get growth out of Europe this year"
287,"I think its certainly still early, their story for performances they have done a great job of mitigating much of the North American challenge â€“ with a great challenge with a great business in China"
288,But weâ€™re â€“ its still a little early days on North America and if thatâ€™s going to tick up or not
289,"Well, certainly the certifications and those kinds of things are certainly something that was from an early perspective is really one of the reasons why we have such great growth last couple of years in North America"
290,At the end of the day thereâ€™s really itâ€™s sort of mostly a two horse race here and with good competitor there in Wayne
291,So I think at the end of the day how that will play out over the next several years is how we predicted
292,So we were never counting on that certifications being our competitive advantage
293,"Our real competitive advantage is being number one, and dispensers being number one in payments and having the largest retail POS system for retail petroleum in the industry"
294,So you combine that with our lead detection capability at Veeder-Root that ultimately is our completive weapon itâ€™s the technology we have at the site that we think is how we compete in
295,Itâ€™s a logical competition amongst smart minded players if you will
296,So we â€
297,“ thatâ€™s one of the reason why we like the market so much
298,Well as we think about M&A relative to both field solutions and product realization or where Fluke and tech are
299,"We certainly feel very strongly that additions to the set of solutions that we want to add at Fluke in manufacturing, in facilities where we take advantage of our huge installed base as Fluke are going to really like eMaint like we did last quarter are going to be the transactions or something bigger that would give us the ability to leverage our position around the world"
300,Those are great deals and I think weâ€™ve said over time that our funnel for field solutions is been good for a while
301,"Relative to tech and product realization, there was certainly a large transaction"
302,â€
303,“ we know the company
304,"well, we used to be in that industry"
305,but we got out of it
306,"So we really were interested in it, we felt strongly that that exposure to the telecommunications players and things like that over time was probably less where we were going"
307,"So I think from that perspective itâ€™s probably safe to say that while we were in that business a number of years ago and so we know a number of the players in the industry, its where weâ€™re going with Tektronix is really around service and adding capabilities there to reduce volatility, to improve the margin structure, built on the great brand that we have attacked"
308,Those are going to be the kind of deals that we would typically play that would be in our suite spot
309,But nothing in industries where weâ€™d likely see more volatility and where weâ€™d see consolidation amongst customers
310,All right
311,"Thanks, Patrick"
312,Have a great night
313,"Hey, Joe"
314,"So Joe, what weâ€™ve got begin is â€"
315,“ what we normally have been looking for we think we have opportunities for 30 to 50 basis points of price
316,"I think your question, on the cost side about what we expect from commodities and inflation and weâ€™re not really seeing a lot of inflation and if this plan"
317,So when we see it will react to it
318,And we also have one of the great things about our portfolioâ€™s weâ€™re not exposed to a lot of commodities
319,"So as this mean weâ€™re perhaps zero, but fairly little"
320,So we havenâ€™t seen much of that upward pressure but even when there is we donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be a big driver that we wonâ€™t be able to offset
321,"Joe, I just wanted to add to that"
322,That includes growth to â€
323,“ so when we think about it what Chuck
324,and I view on our quarterly basis as we mean with every month we meet with our operating leaders to go through the financial
325,And if we think we have opportunity both either on the cost side or on the growth side will typically make decisions for incremental investments as we see the quarter play out
326,"All right, thanks, Joe"
327,"No, good question, but no, no our guide have been 100% or 105% free cash flow to net income does not assume any significant change in that"
328,Going forward over time I can see that percentage working up with when we â€
329,“ as we do more M&A and get that benefit amortization
330,youâ€™ll see it come off of 100% to 105% to something higher
331,"Thanks, Brian"
332,"Well, thereâ€™s a lot of scenarios out there and weâ€™re watching them all"
333,"But net, net from the best way, the way weâ€™re working on it that we were a net exporter here"
334,And so every scenario that I have seen this is going to be favorable to us
335,We do have things that we import externally
336,but we export more
337,So every â€“ so far in every scenario that I think weâ€™re going to turn out to have a lower tax rates as if and when they pass the law and in act
338,"All right, thanks, Charley"
