Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today
Our teams grew total company sales and increased profits across all segments in the second quarter
The home products market continued to grow, with strong demand in new construction and continued growth in R&R
Importantly, our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth, which has resulted in second quarter and year-to-date margin expansion across all of our businesses
We remain on track for another terrific year
Based on our solid first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising the bottom end of our full year EPS outlook by $0.04. First, I'd like to spend some time in our view of the U.S
home products market
Next, I will provide my perspectives on our business performance in the second quarter
Pat will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and our 2017 outlook
Starting with our view of the U.S
home products market
In the second quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow about at the pace that we expected
New construction grew high-single digits with strength in single-family, while R&R grew at roughly 5% with solid growth in the core and some softness at the higher end
As expected, new construction continues to grow at a high-single digit rate, with single-family growing faster than multi-family
Single-family entry-level activity continues to be robust as builders are working against strong order books and permits coming out of the winter and spring selling seasons
This demand helped us in the second quarter and given the lag in our categories should set up a good second half as well
Repair and remodel demand also posted solid growth, especially for products at the entry level and mid-price points
Big remodel project activity was a little slower in the quarter versus strong activity in the second quarter of last year, as installation trade labors tightened money markets
The backlog in this project work could push some volume into the second half
Looking forward, our overall assumption remains that the U.S
home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate for the full year
Our basket of near-term indicators for home products continues to point towards strong demand
And builders and contractors are continuing to acquire labor
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance
In the second quarter, our teams delivered solid sales overall and exceptional profit performance across our operating segments
Sales increased 5% in total and 6% from our home products businesses
Excluding FX, sales were up 6% in total and 7% in home products
Total company operating margin increased 100 basis points to 15.8%
Starting with our Plumbing segment, sales were up 15% for the quarter with growth in all channels
Organic sales growth was above market in the high single-digits
Across all of our channels, we saw strong sell through and our new and refreshed product lines continued to attract consumers who trust our brands
Our Global Plumbing Group delivered as planned in the second quarter, achieving organic growth above the market rate and our recently acquired brands ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe and Shaws accelerating our growth
We're winning new business with this product portfolio of brands and price points and are in the early stages of realizing all the growth potential that we have identified
As we couple this brand line up with our new high impact marketing team, we see some exciting opportunities in the balance of 2017 and in the years to come
Our operating margin improved in the quarter on strong mix and is tracking to our target of 21% for the year
Overall, the North American Plumbing business picked up momentum throughout the quarter and channel inventory levels are stable to down slightly, which should help us as we enter the second half of the year
Our growth in the balance of the year should continue to benefit from strong new construction demand as well as new products and placements
Some of these include the roll-out of new Propel showerheads and additional magnetic styles, new Hamden bath suite in retail and black matte-finish product line extensions in wholesale and the U by Moen, our Wi-Fi connected smart shower system
China sales increased double-digits in local currency, driven by share gains and strong demand in direct-to-builder, as homes under construction are pushed to completion
The R&R business in China also continues to emerge, as properties built over the last 15 years to 20 years enter remodel cycles
We continue to monitor the China housing market closely as the government modifies its policies
We have flexibility as demand fluctuates and have successfully navigated through a number of cycles in this market over the past decade
Turning to our Cabinets segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth
Sales grew against a tough prior-year comp and we continued to deliver on margin growth
In the second quarter, our Cabinets sales were up 1% over the prior year or 2% excluding FX as we faced a difficult comp of 17% in last year's second quarter
Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 13.6%, despite modest commodity pressure as we achieved targeted share gains in attractive parts of the market
Dealer sales were flat for the prior year where we were up 11%
We continued to see strong demand for our new construction in core semi-custom product lines offset by some softness in our higher end product lines sold into more complex projects
We continue to feel good about our performance in the dealer channel even as we were flat in the second quarter against a tough 11% comp
We are working with the strongest dealers and every MSA across the country and are selling more brands into these dealerships
Our focus on profitable growth is working in this higher margin channel, where our dedication to high levels of service is a sustainable competitive advantage
Sales of our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers grew high-single digits
New product introductions lifted ASPs and new programs with our retail partners are performing well
This is a clear area of strength in our Cabinets business and growth should continue to be solid going forward as we leverage our product innovation and our logistics expertise
The remaining part of our Cabinets business which includes home centers, semi-custom, builder-direct in targeted markets in Canada was down slightly
Our builder-direct business grew strong double digits and our disciplined approach to growth in targeted markets resulted in share gains and continued margin improvement
Sales growth in this area was offset by Canada, which declined double digits
Canada has now had five quarters of negative growth due to soft new construction market in the central provinces, our exit of some low margin retail product lines and the impact of currency
At the beginning of the year, we began refocusing this business and accelerated the exit from some product lines
This will result in a cleaner, more focused business going forward and we project mid-single digit growth in the second half of 2017 with a stabilizing market backdrop
In summary, our core Cabinets business excluding Canada and premium was up 4%
Given our strong execution and the easier comps in the second half of the year, we expect full year Cabinets sales to be in the mid-single digit range with a significant pick up in the second half
Importantly, we continued to grow our operating margins as planned
We remain on track for the year end guidance
And our focus on profitable growth has us growing share in the most attractive parts of the market and continuing to de-emphasize other areas with less attractive margins
Doors reported sales were up 4.5% for the quarter
Door products again saw sales growth with gains in wholesale and at retail, which both benefited from new product introductions
Therma-Tru wholesale saw strong growth in new construction markets and excitement around our new initiatives such as new Shaker, hybrid and composite edge door styles focused on the heart of the market
And improved finish selections in glass mix as the trend toward clear and privacy glass expands
Additionally, big builder customers remain optimistic regarding the second half and we finished the quarter with good momentum and balanced channel inventory
In retail, we continued to benefit from our enhanced merchandising and new product launches including new Shaker, (10:52) and two-panel designs
We continue to expect mid to high-single digit full-year growth for the Door business with strong operating margin improvement
In the Security segment, sales decreased 2% from the prior-year quarter and were primarily impacted by timing as the first quarter saw an unusually high 7% growth rate and some shipments and programs were pushed from the second quarter into the second half
We expect to grow full-year sales around 4%
New product introductions and marketing initiatives will help drive second half growth as we load new stainless steel products into retail and pursue new initiatives in safety products
Importantly, margin continues to expand in this business
We are well on track to achieve our margin target for the year of 15% or better
The integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock continues to enhance our margin and our continuous improvement activities offset a modest increase in the price of steel
So to recap the quarter, the markets for our products remained strong with a new construction market that continues to build momentum and an R&R market that is characterized by healthy demand, but a bit of a backup on more complex projects due to some trade labor constraints
Our businesses continue to execute against our disciplined growth strategies
Across the company, we're on track to deliver against our sales growth and margin targets
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth
We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend
Right now, we're very busy working on a number of acquisition opportunities across all segments of our business
While we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, our pipeline is robust and I would expect that we can close on some of these tuck-in acquisitions over the next 12 months given the overall level of activity
As a reminder, over the next three years, we're continuing to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth in shareholder value
While acquisitions are our priority, we will also selectively buy-back shares and are committed to a consistent dividend policy
Being efficient with our capital in shareholder-friendly ways has been a hallmark of our nearly six years as a public company
So to sum up, the demand for our home products remained strong, particularly in new construction
We're continuing to take share and grow faster than the market in the parts of the market that we target
Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Pat who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for the second half of 2017.
Hey, Scott
First of all, we've got some pretty favorable comps in the second half
Last year, second half Cabinets was relatively weak
So, I think if you kind of do the math and look at kind of where we are seeing orders trending and the demand we see in the market, we're pretty comfortable with second half growing to the point where overall Cabinets are going to be in mid-single digits
So, I think there is stability all the way across
The only thing that we are seeing backing up and we saw some of this in the second quarter was as we talked to our customers, designers are very busy and there's kind of a queue waiting to get time with the designer and then installers, carpenters, trade labor are pretty booked up right now too
So, some of that is pushing some of the activity into the second half
There's good underlying demand
It's just getting more sequenced
So, that's the only hesitation we saw in the second quarter coming through
I talked a little bit about premium
We've been talking about premium through second half of last year, it's improving
So, especially fourth quarter last year, premium was very soft
Came into the first quarter, it got a little bit better and right now, it's trending kind of – it was off a little bit, just down low-single digits
So, that's kind of correcting back and as we look into the second half versus comps, we should be pretty good
So, as I look into the second half, it feels like we've got some pretty good momentum rolling through the business
Locally, market-by-market, the strength of our position, the cross-sell that we've got off the Norcraft brands into the core MBCI dealers, all that's going really well
And there is a strong underlying growth on new construction, which just feeds into dealers so that local dealers are doing those small and midsized builders and that continues to run at a pace
So overall, we feel pretty good about the second half
It will run on the business for the year
We really run the business for multi-years, and so a lot of it comes down to the pacing of spending that we're making around growth
The strategy there is to execute to grow above market and hold the margin at about 21%, and so we're spending into growth
We're leveraging the portfolio of brands, the new acquired brands into the channels
We're targeting project business, we're rolling in new product, we're investing in marketing capabilities, and that's paying off
So, you're seeing that in the growth
If you look at – we formed the Global Plumbing Group last summer
If you look at where we're sitting now a year later, you're seeing some pretty good growth numbers and we're targeting that 21%
So, I think, yeah, it is going to have a little bit of the effect of some choppiness quarter-to-quarter around pacing, but it's always in plan
And so when we were talking about the first quarter, I said relax, we'll come near around 21%
Now in second quarter, the only caution is don't get out ahead because we are still targeting 21%, but obviously pretty good quarter, second quarter
And you just see us in the balance of the year spending against the growth, we got great momentum in that business and in some really attractive parts of the business
So we are feeling good about what our new marketing activities are doing, our new marketing team, and so yeah, I'd say target on the 21% for the year, if you look at the first half, you're going to come in around 21% for first half, second half will look a little bit like that
We've got a number of things underway on the M&A side, and I can never predict the timing because there is obviously, it takes two to tango, so there is somebody on the other side of everything we're doing
And I'd say it's a fairly deliberate effort across all four parts of our business in addition to looking at whether there is a fifth category that we might go into
But as we've done everything since we've been a public company six years ago, fairly deliberate, straight-forward, disciplined in our approach
But I'd say, we're looking at we've got over $2 billion to deploy
And if I looked out over the next three-plus years, I'd say that's going to go into a combination of acquisitions and some share repurchase as well as supporting the dividend
I'd say there is a balance or a bias toward acquisition because if it's the right one, it's going to be accretive, it's going to add into kind of the businesses that we've got
And it might create a fifth leg of the company overall
So that's where the bias is
But we'll never force anything, we're comfortable buying back shares, if that's the derivative effect of it as well
I'd say if you look at what we did over the previous five years, and project that over the next three to four years, you're going to get a pretty good mix of the bias toward acquisitions
Acquisition market is pretty good
I mean, we're seeing a lot of things
I think expectations are high on the other side
So we feel comfortable we're going to come together around a number of things over the next 12 months and it's just comforted by the fact that there is a lot of activity that we're working on
Our folks are very busy both here in the Corporate group, as well as within each of the businesses
And so it's a good environment to be in
I think it's – because you've got healthy underlying characteristic on the market, you've got healthy growth
It's easier for both sides to kind of stare at the market and say, we agree on where the market is going over the next three-plus years, with the positive buys and then it's about coming together around how it's going to work
So I feel good about it
I think if you look at total company, you're going to see us – our target over the next three years would be mid-teens
So 2015, 2016 across
You look at Plumbing and we're going to grow above market there and target 21%
If there is a little bit of upside I'm not going to be troubled by that, we're growing above the market
Within Cabinets, we're targeting mid-teens, 15%
We're on a good path there
We're growing in the attractive parts of the market
We're taking share in the attractive parts of the market, other parts of the market which might be more heavily promoted or what have you
We're not troubled by the growth in that part of the market
So we think we're going to be growing at the market about 15% share
Doors will be mid-teens, maybe a little bit bias up there
We continue to get a great mix coming through that business
In Security's we're not going to be mid-teens and I think really as we expand that through acquisition and through some internal product development, that mix will determine whether it runs a little bit higher than that
So again, we're pretty disciplined around looking at profitable growth not just grabbing share or grabbing growth wherever it is
And so if we're sitting here three years with some strong underlying market growth, we're going to see a really attractive margin structure around the total business
Thank you
It's always the case that when we deliver strong quarter top-line, it's usually a number of things that has been going on behind the scenes for a couple of quarters before
So it's a byproduct of investments that we've been making and accelerating product development
So we've got a lot of new products coming into the market that's innovative new products
It's also new finishes, it's some new showering
So there is strong pick-up on the new products side and some placements in the market
It's investments in the marketing that we've got, we've really upgraded the team there, brought in some great new talent and we're getting more sophisticated just in a way we're marketing a lot more digital marketing, data analytics, those sorts of things, that's why you're seeing those pay off in the market overall
So it's good execution on product, on marketing efforts, and targeting both on the retail, wholesale side
And then if you look at the acquisitions, we've got the new portfolio of brands and those groups are working really well together
So you've got kind of that crossover of taking these acquired brands and acquired products and bringing them into distribution opportunities that we've got coming out of the historic Moen franchise, and then vice-versa taking some product innovation that you could move into a product line in a Riobel or ROHL and expand where their opportunities are and we've also come together around some joint projects
So, some bigger hospitality opportunities, those sorts of things
So all that's coming together and I think you're starting to see why we put this together a year ago and I'd say there is pretty good upside over the next few years
This is a growth team, highly energized team
They're having success
They're kind of feeding on each other and we've got good margin discipline in the business with money to invest
So, it's coming together and as I answered the earlier question, I can't predict the exact pace of that spend so the margin bounce around
But look at 21% for the year, look at above market growth, project that out over the next couple of years and that's what our plans look like
And then by the way we're also looking at some acquisitions to further expand what that portfolio can look like in terms of product set and brands
So, I really like where that team is going right now
In Cabs, this is not dramatic
It shows up in terms of kind of the styles and the finishes that really go into new construction and I'd say it's not just entry level, but it is more significant across kind of on this construction
A lot of opaques which is painted, a lot of whites and grays, and so as we look at how we're managing capacity, we're managing capacity and we work towards those products
We've got – remember, we've got a quarter of the Cabinet business
So, we're participating in virtually every price point, every product category
And so as we look at it, it's about shifting where that capacity is, where we're making capacity investments and finishing, where we're emphasizing products that we've got and expanding it into brands and into dealers where there is that demand
So, it's kind of drawing it in, we're not necessarily having to push it
It's going to where that draw is – is where we're responding to it around capacity
In terms of promotion, it continues to be more of a kind of a retail phenomena than it is dealer phenomena and among the big guys we continue to be the least aggressive of those
We've held share there so our approach is working
I'd say, it's kind of more of the same, little bit elevated second quarter, but we held on to the share we've got and didn't chase after it
Clearly, as you saw in the margin expansion, we're not chasing after a lot of promo sale
Yeah, I mean, it is where it is as the capacity in the market gets absorbed, the bias for more promotion goes down because others will start to behave as we have which is needed to fillip your plans and we felt for a while that we remain disciplined and focus on those personal market that we see attractive margins that we'll be doing just fine and I think that's what is playing out
Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC I wanted to go back to some of the share gains in Cabinets that you've seen
Can you just give us a bit more color on perhaps who you think you're taking that share from and how sustainable is that especially as we think about maybe some of the shift that's coming in terms of price points?
So, it's really – our Cabinet business right now is about a quarter of the market and you can really look at a number of different segments within that business
So within in-stock, cabinets and vanities, we're a really big participant in that part of the market now
There is a couple of private companies out there that are also participants in that part of the market and there're some import product, but we've consistently taken share in that market going back to the acquisition of WoodCrafters and then building off of that platform and expending our own internal capabilities
So, where you've seen us gain share in that vanities and in stock, we've got great product; we've got great service, we've got great logistics support into retail, which is managing all that inventory at the store level with them in a great partnership and across all the big retailers
And so that's really sustainable and those are kind of just doing a lot of the fundamentals and intrinsics, and a lot of complicated business process really, really well
When you look at new construction, we targeted going back two years, three years now, probably more like three years, more the East than the West and in the East, just focused on those places where we thought we would be quite competitive and we've been growing faster than the market with those targeted builders and in those targeted markets
So, I'd say, you kind of look at that as geographically where we're targeting
We're having success because it works for us in that part of the market
Within dealer, it's just about that breadth of our dealer coverage and the number of dealers that we've got across North America and cross-selling more and more brands into them across price points and so that's quite sustainable because we haven't penetrated that whole dealer base yet to the maximum extent that we can
And then within Canada, Canada has kind of been a soft market for us
We took some steps earlier this year, second quarter included to restructure part of the market, so that market will start growing again
It was up mid-teens, but there isn't – the competitive intensity isn't the issue, it's more about the market has been soft especially in the single-family side of the market, and we were a bit too diffused in all the products that we were supporting up there
So, we try to tighten that up a bit
So, I'd say, overall, we obviously compete against a couple of the other public cabinet manufacturer but you look at across the board it's those plus still some private companies be it either in the in-stock or the cabinets or vanities side where there is a especially one big private company and then on the dealer side you still have a fragmented market with a lot of local guys who are still supporting their local market dealers
Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
Great, that's very helpful
And then I know, in your comments you motioned some higher steel prices that you faced in your Security segment
Can you just perhaps talk broadly across the business
How you are thinking about commodity prices and inflation as we think about the second half?
Yeah
And it starts with – we budgeted for the year, that you'd see some commodity expansion
We had been two years, three years, with very favorable commodity environment
So, we assumed coming into the year that we would – all of our big commodities would see some inflation
I'd say it's tracking in aggregate at or a little bit better, more beneficial to us
But then if you break it into each segment you're seeing some pressure in certain parts of the market
What we're able to do is leverage our scale in terms of trying to offset some of that, and the way we buy some of those commodities
And then in some places we have to take price to offset some of that pressure
And so, it's a fairly deliberate effort kind of across each of the four businesses has all of a different pressure point
But so far, we've been pretty successful in countering that in our operations, and then where we had to take some limited price to offset it
Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay, great
Very helpful, thanks
It was a catch-up, a true-up of the performance of our healthcare plans in 2016. What we did in 2016 and we've continued in 2017 was, we introduced the option for our associates to elect some high deductible plans and that's typically younger folks who are quite healthy, but are compelled by health insurance, opted for high deductible plans
We're pretty conservative in our estimation of how that would play out and by the third quarter last year, we actually had to true it up and take some more income in because the expense was performing better than what we thought it would
Since then, we've got a better beat on how those perform within our overall healthcare plans and so now, it's just running at what is the projected level, so that was a one-time catch-up and now we kind of know how those plans perform
That was across the board
employees, so we introduced higher deductible healthcare plans, all four of our businesses have got pretty healthy U.S
employee base, we're 70% U.S
employees and so that was kind of across the board
Some of those people historically might not have taken healthcare
But, so often we've got them on the healthcare rolls and we got a high deductible plan
And we don't know, okay, they got high deductible, but once the deductible goes away, they're going to be spending at some higher level above that
It turned out now it's actually more predictable than we thought
