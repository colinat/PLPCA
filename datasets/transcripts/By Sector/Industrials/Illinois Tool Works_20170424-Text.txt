Thanks, Michael, and good morning
Overall, we're off to a good start in 2017. Organic growth improved to 3.5% in Q1 due to a combination of improving end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments and continued progress on our pivot to growth efforts across all seven of our segments
We were able to leverage this improving organic growth performance into very strong earnings growth, with EPS up 19% year-on-year in the quarter, 21% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation
Operating margins of 23.3% were up 120 basis points and were the highest in the history of the company, despite 50 basis points of margin dilution from the EF&C acquisition
After-tax return on invested capital improved 260 basis points to 23.8%
As you saw based on our Q1 performance, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint and raising our full year organic growth rate forecast to a range of 2% to 4%
Overall, our Q1 performance reflects another solid step forward for the company
And I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for all their hard work and their deep commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence
As a result of their ongoing efforts, I have no doubt that we will continue to make strong progress on the path to ITW's full potential through the balance of 2017 and beyond
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q1 performance and 2017 forecast
Michael?
Well, I don't know if we can give you a peak
What I can tell you is, relative to where margins peaked that you referenced in terms of the, I think you said 2014, certainly, the impact of the enterprise initiatives that we have been implementing across the company have been taking place in Welding right along with the rest of the company
So what you're seeing in terms of improved margin performance is starting to turn the corner, obviously, in terms of demand and revenue, and the benefits of those enterprises initiatives are now starting to come through in a little bit more of a visible way, let's say, relative to an environment where we're down mid to high single digits
So they've done a lot of really strong work despite a very tough environment over the last three or four years in terms of the enterprise initiatives
And I think as Michael noted in terms of the demand environment, we were certainly encouraged by some noticeable improvement primarily in the commercial end of our equipment business
But even the industrial down, I think, 1% in Q1 was a noticeable improvement in terms of what we've been seeing over the last six quarters or so
So things appear to be stabilizing there, getting better on the commercial end
And if we continue on this path, obviously, it will have some pretty good impact in terms of our performance through the balance of the year
Hi, Scott
Well, I think it's – from my perspective, Scott, it's hard to tell at this point
I think the overall order – we typically operate with very little backlog, very little forward visibility
The uptick in demand in Test & Measurement is certainly encouraging at this point but it's only a quarter
I think we have a general view, that I think many people share, that the overall business investment climate has been very depressed for the last six to eight quarters that, as a result, there is some pent-up demand that should conditions overall – the economy overall begin to improve even modestly that that will be a stimulus in terms of bringing some more comfort around investment back into the picture
So we're certainly hopeful that this is the start of something – a more positive turn in that direction, but I think after one quarter, I don't think we're ready to call it that yet
Good morning, Joe
Yeah, I think I'd just go back to what I said earlier that – and this is, at least in terms of our sort of past history, this is what we're seeing in the first quarter, the normal signs of a recovery in the welding space
The commercial end for us of the equipment space typically leads the turn, if you will, and so the commercial business was up 4% in the quarter, which was a nice improvement in terms of uptick relative to not just percentage growth but on a sequential basis, up noticeably from Q3. So things are setting up for a nice turn in the marketplace
But again, I think after one quarter, we're – what I would say, not to sound like the pessimist here, but we've been here before a few times, right? With a reasonable start to the year over the last two or three years and then things in terms of the overall economic environment kind of have petered out
So I think that experience has us a little cautious in terms of posture, but I would say that we're certainly seeing some signs, even in those prior periods that we didn't see before, that give us some level of hope or optimism that we're seeing some broader based recovery than maybe we have in the past that hopefully will sustain itself as we continue to move through this year and beyond
Morning
(25:24)
Near term, I think the sort of macro, from my standpoint, is we are – the industrial side, given the very sluggish business investment environment, has been the slower growing part of the company
That is seeming to improve
Obviously, if that continues, that will adjust that mix a percentage point or two over time
But I don't see it shifting dramatically off of that 60-40 mix
I think the most – beyond the end market recovery, the other thing I'd point to, as we've talked before, is we've got plenty of room to grow
In all seven of our businesses, we are continuing to make good progress in terms of the work we need to do on that pivot, and so consumer or industrial, all of our seven businesses have plenty of room to run in terms of ability to drive above-market organic growth from here forward
Yeah, I appreciate the point
What we have said, I think, on numerous occasions is quarterly comps, particularly given some of the differences in relative product positions between us and the other great companies in this space, I think are really not particularly meaningful
We don't take credit for them when they work in our favor and in cases where they don't, I wouldn't read too much into what I think the overall – I think it's a fair comparison on an annual basis, certainly not one that's particularly valid in my mind on a quarter-to-quarter basis
And even on an annual basis, there are still big differences in terms of relative product mix across all the different parts of the Welding portfolio
So you'll have to draw your own conclusions on that
But I think quarter-to-quarter, there's just too much stuff that is individually impacting all the various companies in different ways that makes it less relevant, I think, to add it up as a – in the aggregate sense
And again, I think we're as consistent about saying that when it works in our favor as it does when it – as we are when it doesn't
Well, I think we've talked about it, Mig
The big delta was the organic growth rate and the drivers of that delta in terms of organic growth rate were Automotive, Test & Measurement, Welding
And based on – we've talked before about the fact that we forecast based on current run rates, so our balance of the year forecast does reflect those improvements that we saw in Q1 in those businesses
Auto was a bit of an exception, as Michael talked about earlier
I think we're taking a very conservative approach
We understand that there're some issues out there in North America on the back half of the year that may or may not impact demand for our products
But we're using the data that we have externally and fully baking that in
But beyond that, everything else is run rated through the balance of the year based on the exit rate in the first quarter
Yeah, I don't think a lot has changed
What I would say is that we did have some – a few good sized project pushout into Q2. So, in terms of Q1 growth rate, it was a little light relative to what we thought it was going to be heading into the quarter but not by much
We're still expecting, on a global basis, 3% to 4% organic growth in Food Equipment for the year
And we've talked before, we got a really strong new product pipeline
We are making great progress across the business both in North America, in Europe and in Asia in terms of driving those new products and our other pivot to growth penetration efforts and feel really good about the balance of the year there
So, no big changes in terms of end market demand color
Good morning
We're still trying to figure out who they voted for
No, I wouldn't say that
Our visibility is about a quarter ahead, so for now, what we see is second quarter is set up pretty well
Beyond that, we're just reacting to an IHS forecast that says that there's – I think the number's negative 10 for the Big 3 in the back half of the year
And that's some production – that's some extended shutdowns due to some model changeovers and things – all those things may be very valid
So we are trying to incorporate the best data that we have
I don't mean to sound skeptical at all
If I did, that's my mistake
But I think what we're trying to convey is that we've got that all baked in, in terms of our balance of the year organic growth forecast, and still expect the overall company to be better than we did heading into the year
I think the mix is roughly 50-50. It's close to that
And from a margin standpoint, I think they're also pretty comparable
So no, shouldn't have any material mix impact on margin
No, not an issue certainly in the Q1 performance and not one we expect to be an issue through the balance of the year
Well, I think how I would answer that is we're pretty focused on dishwashing, refrigeration, cooking and scales in the retail sector
We have really strong positions – relative share position in service – don't let me leave out service, is the other big opportunity
I'm not going to give you our assessment of our global share, but let's just say, we got plenty of room to grow in those areas
So from the standpoint of, is the growth going – as our focus in terms of go forward growth around getting it to new areas, that's not a big focus for us
Our focus is on really leveraging the full potential of the really strong positions that we already have
Service, warewash, refrigeration, cooking
But Michael did add a bold (38:44) point to the plus
Maybe you didn't catch that in there
Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC I guess, two questions
One, was there anything unusual about the cadence of sales throughout the first quarter? Did it follow the typical seasonal trend and sort of what you're seeing into April? And then my second question within Construction, Europe saw some pretty nice growth, and I know that's a business that you guys have been restructuring
So was that – did you grow in line with the market, above market? I'm just wondering whether we're starting to see the benefits from your organic growth initiatives
