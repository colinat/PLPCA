0,"Okay, thank you"
1,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Kansas City Southernâ€™s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call"
2,"Slide 4 lists the presenters for today, and I think everyone is familiar with our teams, so I wonâ€™t read their names"
3,Iâ€™ll begin my comments on Slide 5.
4,"As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, our adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.12, a decrease of 9% from last year"
5,"Revenues were $599 million, unchanged from last year"
6,"Excluding the impact of further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 3% higher than last year"
7,Volumes for the fourth quarter were also unchanged from 2015.
8,"Our operating ratio for the quarter was 64.8%, which was 120 basis points higher than last year"
9,"There are some one-time items in the operating ratio for last year that made this a particularly tough comp for us, and Mike Upchurch will walk you through some of those factors in a few minutes"
10,"Our operating ratio for the full-year was 64.9%, which was a 190 basis points lower than last year"
11,"Weâ€™ll talk in bits and pieces about the 2017 outlook, but obviously, the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds"
12,"And the irony of us reporting earnings on the inauguration day of the 45th president is not entirely lost on us, so weâ€™ll move on"
13,But and I just want to pick up the last point here
14,We still remain very positive longer-term about the growth opportunities that weâ€™re facing
15,Brian Hancock will talk about many of those growth opportunities in a little while
16,"Moving onto Slide 6, I wanted to provide a few â€"
17,"“ some commentary on a few of the more interesting topics that youâ€™ll hear about in the presentation that follows, and that we know what is on all of your minds"
18,"And first, there is the U.S"
19,/Mexico
20,trade issue
21,"Obviously, there are still many questions about the future of NAFTA and the trade relationship between the U.S"
22,and Mexico
23,"While weâ€™ve gotten some indication of the direction of the new administration through the nomination of most of the key trade policy makers, we still donâ€™t have definitive answers to several of those questions"
24,"What we do know is that the presidentâ€™s team has indicated that there will be a process for reshaping Americaâ€™s trade policies, which could include updating NAFTA"
25,The Mexican government has expressed its willingness to begin the process of modernizing the agreement as well
26,Iâ€™m extremely pleased to have been recently chosen by the U.S
27,/Mexico CEO Dialogue to lead its Strategic Trade Working Group
28,/Mexico
29,CEO Dialogue is an organization through which business leaders on both sides of the border seek to enhance trade and economic collaboration between the U.S
30,"and Mexico, as a private sector complement to the government to government high level economic dialogue, which involves the Presidents and senior officials from both countries"
31,"Second, the Mexican peso continues to weaken against the U.S"
32,dollar and now stands at levels that are almost 20% below last year
33,"In prior quarters, weâ€™ve talked about the impact the weak peso could have on our business, particularly in our international intermodal business"
34,Iâ€™m happy to report that it looks as if we recovered some market share last earlier in the year in our business at CÃ¡rdenas
35,"Furthermore, it does not appear that the currency value is having a negative impact on our overall portfolio pricing"
36,Brian will discuss both of those topics in a few minutes
37,"Most of youâ€™ve noticed that Mexican increased fuel prices on January 1, in some zones by as much as 15% to 20%"
38,Our average diesel fuel cost in Mexico now stands about 70% higher than in the U.S
39,"The excise tax credit helps to offset the higher Mexican fuel cost, so we will need to aggressively manage our fuel procurement and locomotive management strategies to make certain we donâ€™t experience any margin erosion, as Mexico continues to work through its energy deregulation timelines"
40,"On the positive side of that equation, the level of interest weâ€™re seeing from U.S"
41,"refiners exporting fuel into Mexico continues to gain momentum, and we expect that to drive higher shipments of refined products beginning in 2017."
42,"Again, Brian will have more to say on that topic a little later"
43,"Finally, our operating performance during the quarter was admittedly not up to our expectations, and we saw a noticeable deterioration in terminal Dwell during the quarter"
44,"Drilling into this a little deeper, this is not an altogether negative story"
45,"One of the primary contributing factors to our Dwell performance was the opening of two new and very large customer facilities in our Northern region, which encompasses the Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo area"
46,Both of these facilities were not fully prepared with adequate track infrastructure inside their facilities when they opened
47,"This resulted in severe congestion in three of our terminals in that region, where we saw a 19% increase in volumes over the last year"
48,"The good news is that the needed track infrastructure is being built now, and we can see a clear path to improvement in the near-term"
49,Jose Zozaya will get into that in more detail in a few minutes
50,"Moving onto Slide 7, just one more comment or a couple more comments about trade in Mexico"
51,"This slide shows all of our cross-border traffic, including the business that we interchange with Union Pacific at Laredo by export and import"
52,"As you can see, 60% of our total cross-border carloads are southbound or export business"
53,"Most of you know that KCSâ€™s largest cross-border commodity group is grain, specifically, yellow corn from the Midwest into Mexico"
54,"Furthermore, two of our large cross-border business opportunities for the future are also export-oriented from the U.S"
55,"to Mexico, namely refined products in plastics"
56,Thereâ€™s enormous amount of data available about NAFTA
57,and I donâ€
58,™t intend to go through any of that today
59,"However, I wanted to show this chart simply to convey that this is a complex issue, and thereâ€™s a lot of risk for both the U.S"
60,and Mexican economies
61,"If any future trade negotiations are not handled very thoughtfully, which Iâ€™m sure they will be"
62,I believe that any modification in NAFTA can and will be done in a rational way that will likely strengthen North Americaâ€™s economy and KCS future
63,Mexico is our neighbor and our third largest trading partner
64,Our economies in our societies are inextricably connected
65,Iâ€™m encouraged by some of the Cabinet nominations and comments that have been made since the election and in my role with the U.S
66,"/Mexico CEO Dialogue, Iâ€™m hopeful that I will have an opportunity to engage directly in the process, not only mindful of KCS interest in this topic, but that of most of our large customers as well"
67,"With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer"
68,I just have a couple of comments before we open it up here
69,I just want to go back
70,"First of all, I misspoke in my opening comments about the operating ratio change for the quarter"
71,"I stated, it was 120 basis points, obviously, when you saw Mikeâ€™s slide, itâ€™s a 140 basis points"
72,"But just kind of putting a little bit of a wrap on the quarter and the outlook, I think, again, while itâ€™s hard to get it too excited about revenues being flat"
73,"As Mike mentioned, this ended a string of seven successive quarters of revenues â€"
74,“ revenue declines
75,"The outlook obviously, Brian, went through by commodity on Slide 15, we think it looks pretty strong and weâ€™re enthusiastic about 2017."
76,"And as Jeff mentioned in his comments on the performance, the operating performance when you consider that some of the deterioration that we saw was related to a surge in growth, particularly in the Northern part of our network"
77,"And the capital investment thatâ€™s being made to deal with that, weâ€™re very confident that weâ€™ll see a return to more solid performance numbers very soon"
78,"So with that, I will open the line up for questions"
79,Question-and-Answer Session
80,"Thank you, Jason"
81,"Chris, Iâ€™ll take that one"
82,Weâ€™re going to remain steadfast in our position that weâ€™re not going to give specific guidance
83,"But clearly, when you look at the â€"
84,"“ just that one slide, it would certainly indicate that we expect 2017 to be better than 2018."
85,", sorry, 2017 to 2016."
86,"But until we get more in clarity on some of the environmental and other factors that are on the landscape, weâ€™re just going to kind of stay where we are"
87,I just chime in and add a couple of comments here
88,"And that is, we are trying to stay very, very close to some of these major customers and projects, obviously"
89,So that we are adjusting if necessary or appropriate
90,our capital thought for the next two or three years and beyond
91,"And as Brian said, weâ€™re not getting any indication from some of these other opportunities in the pipeline that their plans have changed"
92,So we need to be prepared for that business when it comes
93,"Then on Ford, if â€"
94,“ just another kind of color commentary
95,"If you look at what they said when they made their announcement, itâ€™s all about the investment environment in the United States, is looking better to them"
96,That plant was just begun construction
97,"And so they made a decision based on the outlook for the environment, the tax environment, the regulatory environment, thatâ€™s all very positive"
98,"And I think if companies start to do that, itâ€™s going to result in the trade deficit eventually improving from the U.S"
99,"And we look at the opportunities that weâ€™re talking about and the opportunities for additional exports, we think that thatâ€™s all going to be taken into consideration, as the policymakers began to work this issue through and come to what we think and what we hope is a reasonable outcome"
100,Itâ€™s top secret
101,Itâ€™s
102,"â€“ Iâ€™d say, itâ€™s more along the the latter, where as I said earlier, weâ€™re trying to stay very close to our customers"
103,"So that we understand, if theyâ€™re making any changes"
104,"Do we need to consider that in our capital planning, resource planning?"
105,"And as Brian mentioned so far, weâ€™ve really other than a couple of announcements that are pretty highly publicized"
106,", we havenâ€™t seen that"
107,"Weâ€™re also trying to stay as active and involved with policymakers, our friends in the Senate and Congress"
108,"Thereâ€™s just going to be a lot of interest, as this moves forward as we begin to engage with those policy members, both individually and through organizations like the CEO Dialogue"
109,This is an important topic for the AAR
110,"According to the AAR, 30% of all class one carloads are connected to international trade"
111,"So we know that this is one of their top agenda items for 2017, as well"
112,"So and until we kind of know exactly what weâ€™re faced with, our strategy is pretty much the same"
113,Weâ€™re going to continue to invest in those facilities that are going to drive our growth
114,"And again until we have better facts to make any changes, weâ€™ll do that when we feel itâ€™s appropriate"
115,"Obviously, with Ford making their decision, weâ€™ve taken a look at the capital that we were planning to support that facility, but that really wasnâ€™t a 2017 capital item"
116,So but there has been no changes in the last six months that that will affect our capital outlook solely related to the NAFTA discussion
117,"If you go back to Mikeâ€™s comment about security, the cost differential of moving a truck versus a container might be measured in tens of dollars, where the value particularly weâ€™re talking about how high value cargo like electronics or apparel, the value of a single container if it experiences some sort of theft or damages could overwhelm the cost advantage on hundreds of containers"
118,"Well, we donâ€™t report separately the segments between the U.S"
119,and Mexico
120,"But Jeff, if you want to add some color?"
121,"And our volumes in Mexico were growing, as we mentioned earlier, in the Northern part of the region, the three terminals that we used to serve the Northern region volumes in those terminals were up â€"
122,“ was up 19% in the fourth quarter
123,So thereâ€™s still a lot of growth going on
124,"Refined products, plastics"
125,", we see opportunities for export growth there"
126,"And youâ€™re right about the political uncertainty, but it is that, it is uncertainty"
127,"So until we have better clarity and certainty on what is actually going to happen, we need to make the investments to support our customers"
128,"Yes, Ravi, Iâ€™ll handle the pricing question, and then Iâ€™ll let Mike take the other â€"
129,“ the last part of your question
130,"From a pricing perspective, as we said, we felt very comfortable with our core pricing at 3%"
131,We believe that we will do better than that next year and thatâ€™s across all of our customer base
132,"So overall, weâ€™re not going to give anymore guidance than that"
133,"But we feel very comfortable that we understand the markets, where we play and where we need to be priced to continue to move the product in an efficient way for our customers"
134,"So I think the guidance that we gave of, yes, third quarter â€“ our fourth quarter was 3%, and we will either be at that or exceed that for next year"
135,", I feel comfortable with that"
136,"Okay, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for your time and attention"
137,I realize there are a couple of people that will circle back with offline
138,"But we will obviously be out on the conference circuit, and stay tuned if thing develop in Washington and weâ€™ll talk to you again in April"
