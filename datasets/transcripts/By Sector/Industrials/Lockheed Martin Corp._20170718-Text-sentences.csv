0,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our second quarter results and our increased outlook for 2017."
1,"As today's release illustrates, we had strong results this quarter, operationally and financially"
2,"Our strong year to date financial performance also enabled us to increase our full year 2017 guidance for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share"
3,These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across our businesses in providing critical products and services to our customers while returning outstanding value to stockholders
4,It is particularly noteworthy that our quarterly cash flows exceeded last year's second quarter by nearly $200 million when we adjust for the $125 million of IS&GS cash that was included in the 2016 results
5,"Our team continues to progress toward our full year objective in growth in sales, EPS, and cash from operations, and I thank our team for their dedication to our mission"
6,Chris will cover the financial results in detail a little later
7,"However, I want to touch on two events which occurred after our accounting quarter closed that point to the strength of our portfolio and the significant growth opportunities they provide"
8,"First, in our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, our Sikorsky line of business secured a $3.8 billion, five year contract for 257 Black Hawk helicopters to be delivered to the US Army, as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard"
9,"This award marks Sikorskyâ€™s ninth multiple year contract with the US government and includes options for an additional 103 aircraft, bringing the potential value to over $5 billion"
10,We are honored to have the opportunity to continue providing rotary aircraft in support of the important missions of the US Army and our international customer
11,"Second, our Aeronautics business area received an F-35 award on LRIP 11, which includes funding for 74 US jets and totaled nearly $5.6 billion"
12,"This brings the total quantity of US aircraft authorized for LRIP 11 to 91 planes, a growth of 36 fighter jets from LRIP 10 US government order, and represents a 65% increase from the prior lot"
13,"We anticipate a separate order - a separate award later this quarter, which will add additional aircraft for our international F-35 partners and foreign military sales customers"
14,"The recent US award demonstrates continued evidence of the strong support the F-35 has earned, and we look forward to finalizing these contracts as we progress to full rate production"
15,"Turning briefly to Defense budgets, the FY17 DOD budget appropriations have been enacted and were consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement of 2015, bringing Defense Department base budget funding to approximately $524 billion, as well as overseas contingency operations funding to about $83 billion"
16,"Weâ€™re pleased to see that our programs continue to be well supported, as seen by the legislation increasing F-35 aircraft and Black Hawk helicopter quantities"
17,"The higher levels for both the base and OCO budgets, reflect a growing level of bipartisan recognition of rising global security threats and the need for additional budget resources"
18,The additional funding for FY17 will help begin to address some of the acute budget needs to recapitalize our defense assets and respond to the global security environment
19,"Also, the president released his request for the FY18 DOD budget"
20,"This included $574 billion for the base budget, an increase of nearly 10% from the FY17 appropriations and 3% from the prior presidential base budget submission"
21,"Additionally, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, have released their fiscal year â€™18 National Defense Authorization Act markups, both of which greatly exceeded the president's request"
22,And the House has since passed their version by a wide margin
23,"While we recognize - while we realize that these proposals exceed the current budget caps, we are encouraged to see the recognition that our defense budgets require increased levels of funding"
24,We are hopeful that bipartisan agreement can be reached to rescind or modify the budget caps and fund our military at the levels needed to address the current set of world threats
25,"Moving on, I'd like to highlight several operational successes we achieved on our F-35 program, and then briefly comment on the recent historic announcements from the US and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia governments to bolster global security"
26,The program featured two milestones that highlight the growing international nature of the Joint Strike Fighter
27,"The first Japanese assembled F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant, was unveiled at the Final Assembly and Checkout or FACO facility in Nagoya, Japan"
28,This aircraft marks the first of nearly 40 jets that will be produced for the Japanese Ministry of Defense at this location
29,"Similarly, the first F-35B variant to be assembled outside the United States, was rolled out in Italy from the Cameri FACO facility"
30,Cameri has already delivered multiple F-35A versions and is slated to produce over 100 aircraft in total
31,"Together, these two events underscore the benefits of the multinational partnerships that have been forged as we work to provide fifth generation capabilities to both US and coalition forces"
32,"Keeping with the F-35 program, we were also proud to spotlight our F-35A at the Paris Air Show last month"
33,"The CTOL variant performed its inaugural aerial demonstration, showcasing its aerobatic maneuvering and the jetâ€™s raw power to climb and run"
34,"I watched, along with the rest of the amazed crowd, at the Le Bourget Airport as the aircraft flawlessly executed 90 degree climbs, remarkable angle of attack displays, and several unique moves that only a fifth generation fighter could accomplish, all of which shine a bright light on the impressive capabilities this unrivaled stealth fighter provides"
35,"As the crowd erupted into applause, I could not have been more proud of what our Lockheed Martin team, together with the US government, the JPO organization, international partners, industry teammates, and hundreds of suppliers have been able to accomplish"
36,"Before I conclude, I'd like to take a moment to say a few words about the unprecedented announcements that President Trump and his majesty King Salman of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, made in Riyadh in May"
37,"As part of those announcements, the kingdom expressed its intent to procure more than $28 billion worth of Lockheed Martin products and services, including air and missile defense products such as THAAD batteries and PAC-3 missiles, Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships, variants of our Littoral Combat Ship, C-130J aircraft and various other defense related capabilities and solutions"
38,These announcements reflect the strength of the relationship that our corporation has built with the kingdom over the past 50 years
39,"In addition, the request touched each of our four business areas, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our offerings and the growth potential that our portfolio brings"
40,"Finally, I would like to acknowledge our Space Systems team, as they mark the one year anniversary of the Juno spacecraft orbiting the planet Jupiter"
41,"Images from the Juno orbiter graced the cover of the May issue of Science Magazine, delivering breathtaking views of the giant planetâ€™s polar region"
42,The mission also included measurements of the magnetic and gravitational fields and unique perspectives on the atmospheric and weather environments of Jupiter's surface
43,"Scientists are excited at the initial in depth results being provided, as well as with the potential new discoveries that may be made in the upcoming experiments"
44,We believe our continuous commitment to innovation and our long term partnership with NASA have contributed to these remarkable achievements and we are proud to be a part of this ambitious undertaking
45,"Iâ€™ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your question"
46,"Excellent questions, Howard"
47,"Things that I - both of which I have spent a lot of time on, on a regular basis"
48,So thank you for the question
49,"From the strategy standpoint, our focus is on growth"
50,We've been very clear about that
51,We think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow
52,"We see our international growth increasing from what today is about 20 - in 2016 was about 27% of our sales, 30% and weâ€™ll continue to see that growth"
53,"The demand around the world is high for not only F-35, but missile defense"
54,"One of our F-16 C-130s, other defensive systems that we have, as well as our opportunities in space based situational awareness, et cetera"
55,"So that growth, we have been - in terms of your comment about outside our core, the complementary"
56,", I would say that our commercial satellites, our commercial helicopters, those that weâ€™re doing with the LM-100J, which is the commercial version of the C-130, those are absolutely areas to move in commercial but very closely aligned"
57,And then of course the hybrid airship is another opportunity for us
58,"So those all are in line with our core competences and our capabilities, but moving into similar - more into the commercial space and aligning with that"
59,"Long term, we're always focused on our talent management, our talent development"
60,It is an ongoing part of our business
61,"And in terms of succession planning, as you look at the leadership team that we have at Lockheed Martin, very seasoned, very strong, talented team that is - that I'm really proud to be a part of the team and working collectively with them on how weâ€™re executing our strategy for the corporation"
62,But at all times weâ€™re looking at building that pipeline of talent into the business
63,"And yes, we also look at that talent from the standpoint of its diversity"
64,And so I'm proud to say that 21% of our leaders are women and we continue to bring more talent in from that regard
65,So succession planning is something that we continue to look at as a company and it's an ongoing effort for us
66,Thanks for the question
67,Sure
68,Iâ€™ll take those
69,"Weâ€™re looking at where the Air Force is and TX and JSTARS, theyâ€™re looking at - theyâ€"
70,™ve set an award in the fourth quarter of this year
71,"Obviously we never know until they actually do it, and so we couldn't say,"
72,but that's what they've outlined
73,is the fourth quarter of 2017 for JSTARS and TX
74,"And then we see some other near term awards that we're hoping to see in September, October timeframe, ones like the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services that weâ€™re unencumbered on that today and us being - itâ€™s in competition"
75,and we hope to see that award
76,Itâ€™s got total program value with options of up to $8 billion
77,Our Ground Based Strategic Defense is another one that we would look to have to see an award coming here in the fourth quarter
78,"And we're hoping as we look at the Saudi operations, the opportunity that we have there that potentially we could see a fat award sometime late in the year, early next year"
79,"And then another would be LRSO, the Long-Range Standoff Missile"
80,That is also looking at September timeframe
81,And letâ€™s see
82,"Another would be, the Saudis are looking at getting the search and rescue and S70i helicopter award that we expect in September timeframe as well"
83,So several awards in the near term
84,I think I rattled off six or seven of them just there
85,And so we're excited
86,"And Bruce, you have some other thoughts?"
87,"Iâ€™ll take that, Seth"
88,Thanks for the question
89,"I would just say first off, we haven't really seen the SAR"
90,I mean we know that it's been submitted to Congress
91,"We know there's been top level readout from the JPO, but the fact sheet that came out on it"
92,"And I think in that, the Joint Program Office highlighted the fact that the reason that the numbers were changing were predominantly due to a change in the procurement profile of the Air Force jets, which is the largest volume buyer for the Air Force"
93,"And - but frankly, we just - I know that in my discussions with the Air Force, there's a desire to buy as many as they can, as quickly as they can"
94,So I haven't got an official position from them that theyâ€™ve reduce their procurement profile
95,That just happens to be what's in that select acquisition report that came out going
96,"I mean certainly lots of opportunity to change the quantities as you can see just with what's in the budget deliberations right now, the adds that are coming forward on the F-35 for the various services"
97,We think it's still in - weâ€™ll still see potentially some upside on it
98,So that would be my take
99,"Bruce, anything you want to add?"
100,"Barely, George"
101,Try again
102,"You mentioned Poland, Rumania and others"
103,"I mean of course we have Aegis Ashore, which is US system"
104,"thatâ€™s been placed in Europe, but that's an opportunity"
105,"Missile defenses, there's a strong demand in Europe, as well as in other parts of the world, Asia Pacific and the Middle East where we continue to see opportunities"
106,JASSM was an opportunity from the standpoint of Poland
107,And so there - you're exactly right
108,"There continues to be in the NATO environment missile defense opportunities for us to continue to meet, as well as for other parts of the world"
109,"And I think as we have recently done the THAAD test out of Alaska, that was a very successful test"
110,"In fact, 14 out of 14 on THAAD, one that I'm sure that many countries will take a look at, at the successful capability of that to take out a ballistic missile"
111,"And so that being an opportunity that we've talked about that currently in South Korea, protecting that area in Guam"
112,But certainly Japan and other countries will continue to look at THAAD as a capability in the European market as well
113,"Thanks, Jason"
114,Those are great questions
115,"If you look at our supply chain, it represents 60, sometimes 70% of the revenue on many of our programs"
116,Itâ€™s
117,"a very important element of our business in terms of our execution on programs, performance on programs as well as what we're able to financially accomplish with those programs"
118,So that's great question
119,"On the affordability front, I would just start with our largest program, which is the F-35 and representing last year about 23% of our sales"
120,We put a lot of effort into that piece of it
121,"And collectively with our team mates, major team mates, with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, we worked together on something we call - that the government calls a blueprint for affordability, where we actually put funding upfront working, not just with the three team mates, Lockheed Martin, BAE and Northrop Grumman, but all the way through our supply chain and identifying areas where we can invest, continue to drive cost down on the F-35 beyond what you would normally get through a ramp up of production and the volume"
122,And we'll continue to do that
123,Weâ€™re also doing that on the sustainment side
124,So look at where are there cost reduction initiatives that we can put in place there that would continue to drive the cost down
125,But we are -
126,we work with supply chain affordability every day on all of our programs
127,I feel really good about our affordability initiatives in that regard
128,"Our teams that work directly with our sub-contractors, with our suppliers, that is one of their primary efforts and ones that working alongside them, theyâ€™re constantly focused on"
129,The other thing I would say is where we have a big opportunity on F-35 is through the block buy because that's where we can get the volume reduction
130,"Thatâ€™s where we can get suppliers, if they know they're going to get three lots worth of work, 450 airplanes and plus, then they can invest in driving the cost down"
131,They can commit to a lower price to us on their element of the system
132,"But bottom line is, we work all the way across our supply chain on ongoing basis and are constantly driving"
133,"In terms of vertical integration, I think it really just is driven on a case by case basis where it makes sense"
134,"I mean if we're assuming that we think we have the capability inside Lockheed Martin, that we could do at less cost and more - and better technology, then we might look at some vertical integration there or through an acquisition that gives us the opportunity to do that"
135,"But generally speaking, we're mainly focused on the affordability and the performance of our supply chain on an ongoing basis"
136,You asked a question about cybersecurity and sort of the health of the industry and what are we doing on that front
137,I will just speak from a Lockheed Martin standpoint
138,We recognize that the supply chain is - it's critically important that they have in place appropriate cyber defenses in their business
139,And so we have worked with the Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards to help put in place voluntary initiatives that - and frameworks that work with supply chain on how they can get employees the appropriate defenses
140,"We then audit and monitor what our supply chain, our suppliers have in the way of cybersecurity defenses on an ongoing basis"
141,And we actually work with our customer
142,Our customer often looks to us for the depth and capability we have in cybersecurity
143,It is a line of business for us
144,"We do it for many customers and supporting them, and we likewise take that same capability and try to work it back through the supply chain as well"
145,"In terms of health of the industry, I think it's an ongoing effort that we've got to constantly stay focused on as a nation"
146,The threats are constantly changing or there's always an unpredictability in that sense
147,But we've been a thought leader and an industry leader in cybersecurity for many years
148,"In fact we have the national cyber range where we develop that and where our government customers and others can bring their solutions and test them on those national cyber range and determine whether it brings the kind of defenses that we're looking for, that they expect"
149,"And so I would say across the board, cyber has been an area for us that, as in everything that we do across the system, it runs through all of our programs"
150,It is - we have a robust capability that we provide to customers and we work hard with our supply chain to make sure that they get the right defenses in their own networks on ongoing basis
151,So I think that that was the last question
152,"Greg, let me just wrap back and conclude the call today"
153,"I want to conclude by restating that our second quarter results and our increased 2017 outlook reflect that we have an ongoing commitment to our strategy for growth, strong cash generation"
154,and we continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers and long term value creation for our stockholders
155,Weâ€™re very pleased with the solid results that we had for the quarter
156,I want to thank you all for joining us on the call today
157,and we look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call in October
158,"So John, that concludes our call today"
