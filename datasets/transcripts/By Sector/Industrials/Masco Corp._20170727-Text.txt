Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone
As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items
Turning to Slide 6. Our continued execution drove solid top and bottom-line growth
The second quarter of 2017 was our 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 4%
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our second quarter revenue by approximately $23 million as the U.S
dollar strengthened against both the Euro and the British pound
North American sales increased 4% in the quarter due to strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as we continue to experience strong consumer demand for our better and best product offerings
As a reminder, repair remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales
International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter as our international Plumbing businesses continue to drive growth
Gross margins expanded approximately 60 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.8%, largely due to the improvement in our North American Windows business
Our SG&A as a percent of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points to 18.5% of sales
This slight increase is partly due to the strategic growth investments we’ve made, such as the 200 new Behr hub store employees we hired last year
We will continue to leverage these investments to drive profitable growth
We delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 4% to $357 million with operating margins expanding 30-basis points to 17.4%, our strongest operating margin in nearly 15 years
Our EPS was $0.60 in the quarter, an improvement of 30% compared to the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, our results in the second quarter of 2016 included a one-time loss on debt extinguishment of $40 million or approximately $0.08 per share to complete the retirement of debt maturities
Turning to Slide seven
Our Plumbing segment once again delivered outstanding results despite a difficult 9% comp
Segment sales increased 5%, excluding the impact of currency driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment’s sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter
Our North American sales grew 4% in the second quarter against a 9% comp as we experienced strong consumer-driven demand for our innovative products and industry-leading brands with wholesale, large retail and dealer customers
As Keith mentioned, Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins each delivered a record quarter of sales and profits
Our international Plumbing sales increased 5% in local currency against an 11% comp as Hansgrohe continues to outperform and benefit from investments in brand, design and innovation
Additionally, we’re focused on growing key markets as yielding results as they experience strong double-digit growth in China
Operating profit for this segment increased 3% in the quarter driven by incremental volume, which was partially offset by some of our strategic growth investments
Turning to slide eight
The Decorative Architectural Products segment grew 5%
This performance was driven by another strong double-digit growth of our BEHR PRO business and solid performance of BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point offering
Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top line performance as it continues to benefit from the expansion and growth of its innovative shower door program
Liberty continues to win new retail programs and was recently awarded an expanded cabinet hardware program, which will be set in the third quarter
As a result of this program win, we anticipate incurring approximately $10 million in program reset costs in the third quarter
Operating income in the second quarter increased 1% driven by increased volume, which was partially offset by an unfavorable price-to-commodity relationship in coatings as we discussed last quarter
Turning to slide nine
In the Cabinetry segment, excluding the impact of currency, sales declined 3% in the quarter
This is principally due to the exit of certain low-margin builder business in the United States and in the U.K
These actions in aggregate reduced segment sales by approximately $10 million
Foreign currency translation also negatively impacted this segment’s sales by approximately $2 million in the quarter
Starting in Q3, we expect to see year-over-year segment sales growth
Our repair and remodel business continue to perform well in the quarter
KraftMaid had solid performance in the retail and dealer channels, delivering mid-single digit growth through increased volume
This performance was achieved against a tough double-digit comp
Segment profitability declined in the second quarter by $7 million as we experienced a more normalized sales and marketing spend as compared to the second quarter of 2016 and softness in our U.K
Cabinet business
As we look to the third quarter of 2017, we expect to incur incremental costs of approximately $7 million related to new product launches as we continue to enhance KraftMaid’s product assortment and due to the recently announced antidumping duties and countervailing tariffs on imported Chinese plywood
We expect the effect of these duties to be temporary as we work to mitigate the impact through supply chain and other initiatives during the remainder of the year
Turning to slide 10. Excluding the $5 million impact of currency translation, our Windows segment sales increased 7% in the second quarter driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S
window business, which grew 10% in the quarter
Milgard’s strong growth was due to increased volume, a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing
Segment profitability in the quarter increased $20 million over the prior year driven by the lapping of last year’s warranty expense, cost-savings initiatives and favorable pricing
We are extremely pleased with the rapid progress that Joe and his team have made on Milgard’s turnaround and their improved results delivered in the first half of 2017. We also completed the sale of our Arrow Fastener business at the end of the second quarter
This will reduce second half of 2017 sales and operating profit by $38 million and $8 million, respectively, split roughly evenly between the two quarters
We remain confident in our ability to achieve top-line growth and mid-single-digit margins in the segment for the second half of 2017 and the full year despite the sale of Arrow
And turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity
Working capital as a percent of sales increased 170 basis points versus the prior year to 15%, principally due to the higher inventory to support our growth in new program wins
We believe we will have this inventory work down to a more normalized level by the end of the year
During the second quarter, we continued our initiative to create shareholder value by repurchasing 1.2 million shares valued at approximately $42 million
And we also took further actions to strengthen our balance sheet by refinancing high coupon debt, thus reducing our interest expense by approximately $3 million per quarter starting in the third quarter
And with that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Keith
And John, just to address your second question about interior versus exterior sales
While we don’t break that out specifically, I can give you some guidance and that’s generally, interior sales far outpace exterior sales at least in our business
So this will all hit in the third quarter, John
This year -- and it’s not -- it’s paint
It’s actually in the Liberty Hardware program reset that we’re doing
And so relative to the third quarter of last year, it will be incremental
Yes, Stephen
So the way I look at it is pretty simple, yes
In terms of these charges in the $1.93 to $2, yes, they are
So the way I think about it is you have $10 million in the Decorative Architectural segment for Liberty, you’ve got the $8 million hit in the second half of the year for the Arrow profit that -- given the divestiture
Then we’ve got the incremental $7 million in the Cabinet segment for the launch costs as well as the incremental tariffs
So in aggregate, approximately $25 million
Favorably offsetting those charges is the $3 million per quarter of interest expense, so call that roughly $19 million to $20 million of headwinds in the second half that are included in our guidance for the $1.93 to $2 which equates to roughly $0.04 a share
Yes, Chris
We think largely that the builder-direct business and the builder-oriented businesses that we’ve been purposefully exiting over the course of the last 4 to 6 quarters is largely behind us now
Could there be a little bit of spillover into the third quarter? Clearly, there could be just a touch
But we really do think that starting now, here in the third quarter of 2017, we should begin to see that segment reposition itself from one that’s been contracting to one that’s going to start to grow
I think you see the fundamental growth in that business over the course of the first half of the year
And what we’re seeing and hearing from our customers, Scott, gives us the confidence
We’re hearing about good showroom traffic at our Cabinet dealers and our Plumbing wholesale dealer -- our Plumbing wholesalers and Plumbing showrooms
So we’re seeing good demand, continuing good demand in our paint business
So all that combined, I think gives us the confidence to raise that lower-end of the range
A couple of things, Scott
Maybe on the corporate expense side, we are up a little bit this quarter, probably due to the stock comp expenses, the share price rises, obviously, that hits us a little bit harder in the corporate expense side
So that was the principal driver there
That said, we still think we’re going to be in approximately $100 million for the full year
And in terms of the share repurchase activity, there are number of things going on
Obviously, we had our Investor Day and you were there and we had the debt transactions going on
So we were out of the market a little bit more around in some of those events than we would typically have been in a normal quarter
That said, we still have our guidance out there for the $400 million to $500 million for this year
And as we’ve discussed in the past, we’ll be opportunistic about how we buy back those shares
And so yes, I would look for slightly stronger activity as we go into the third quarter and beyond
Yes
Sure, Bob
In terms of the margin profile of the business, right? We’ve got very strong incremental margins on this business
And it’s not only on the core business, but the repair/remodel businesses is quite good
But then also, the builder business that we are looking at going forward, can be strong as well
And so we generally look at this segment to have between 35% drop down on incremental sales
So very good position there
So as you think about how we developed though in 2016, we had very strong margins in the first half, Bob
You might recall, we had I think 10.5% margins or so in Q1 last year, then they popped up to about 14% on some like-spend in Q2. Then they tailed off a little bit in the second half of the year because I think we were closer to 8%, 8.5% margin for each -- of Q3 and Q4 last year
So as you think about the comps that we’re up against on the second half of last year, and the trajectory that we’re having in the business, the fact that Keith talked about earlier about both top line growth and margin expansion in the year for this segment, we feel pretty confident that we can achieve those
That’s the right way to think about it, Bob
To give you -- I mean, a little bit more detail on that
I think obviously, a big chunk of that comes down to volume and what we see going into 2018. Obviously, we love the progression that we’ve made so far here in 2017. And so I think if we get higher volumes that -- and clearly, [indiscernible] will help -- recall we’ll have -- we still have a little bit of ERP headwind going into 2018 that’s why we’ll still -- and not -- it won’t be incremental at all, but we’ll still have $3 million to $4 million a quarter of ERP spend as we go into 2018. So that could be a little bit of a governor on net margin expansion
But I think once that falls off, then I think we’ve got a pretty good path to getting to that double-digit margin
About 1.5 years
Yes, Neal
I’d say we probably did, in the first quarter in particular we got a little bit ahead of raw material with price
That said, in my prepared remarks and I think Keith referred to as well, we had a little bit of pricing headwinds in the second quarter
And just given where the commodities are we anticipate probably some very modest inflation going into the second half of the year
But nothing that we’re too concerned about
And Neal, I misspoke just a second ago
I said price headwinds, I meant commodity headwinds
We think that our repair, remodel top line growth of kind of mid-single digits is right in line with industry growth and if not, a little bit better
We didn’t really see a lot of choppiness that the [indiscernible] may have implied in our business
And we had pretty consistent performance through the quarter, Mike
So we’re really pleased with how the KraftMaid brand is performing, and we’re really excited about this new launch that Keith described a little while ago
So we think there’s opportunity for continued steady growth in our repair/remodel side of our Cabinet business
And could you also give us some color in terms of what type of growth you saw out of the builder hardware business this quarter?
Recall, Nishu, that the second half, or I’m sorry, the second quarter, all margins were at about 21%
They were down from the second quarter of last year, so we did start to see some of that commodity headwind hit the segment in the second quarter
And to Keith’s point, we’ll probably feel a little bit more margin pressure in the second half of the year
Yes, Nishu
It’s going to be roughly equivalent in the first half of ‘18, so that’s good catch
I should have probably mentioned that in my remarks
So yes, that’s a, that will be the waterfall effect of the remaining piece of the over divestiture
And just to be clear, on the Cabinet piece, there’s no divestitures per se
But rather, we are deliberately walking away from some low-margin builder business, both domestically as well as internationally
And so that’s the impact
Yes, it was about, as I mentioned, it was about $10 million of impact in second quarter
And could there be a little bit of spillover into third quarter? Yes, there could be, but we don’t anticipate very much
So Stephen, when we gave out the $1.90 to $2, obviously, the Liberty reset costs were not included in that number
Some of the Cabinet launch costs we were -- in our forecast, but the plywood tariffs were unknown at that time
And that’s the bulk of the $7 million number there
The Arrow divestiture was underway, but not particularly well publicized at that time
And so it was not necessarily called out-- so in -- for the interest savings
So you can make an argument that Keith and I knew about the -- that we’re going to divest Arrow, but probably the Street didn’t
And there was a high degree of -- there was a huge factor on that Arrow in our $1.90 to $2 guidance
Yes, that’s right
$0.035, $0.04.
There was currency effect
And also Stephen, we’ve been factoring the Arrow divestiture in the second half of the year
That said, we still think that Milgard can grow nicely
Probably, slightly easier comp
Recall, we had a little bit of an ERP issue in the second quarter of last year
And so that probably impacted a little bit of our revenue
But we feel really confident about what Joe and the team have established with respect to the Milgard brand and then how they brought sales back so quickly
So we do think that there’s good growth in front of us
We’re seeing very good demand with our customers out there, both our dealer customers as well as we do sell a little bit into the major retailers in the Western U.S
And we’re seeing good demand on both sides of -- with both of those customers in the Western U.S
Yes
They were doing the same thing that the U.S
business was doing, but they also ran into a little bit of weakness
I think -- we’re starting to see a little bit of softness broadly across the U.K
since -- with their election taking place in the quarter and the like
There was some softness and there was a little bit more discussion on the Brexit
So we’re seeing a little bit of the consumer pulling back in the UK
But it’s not really a material part of the business, so we’re not too concerned about it
Well, a little bit of load-in related to new product going into some store shelves
But I don’t think it was a significant -- anything significant that we should call out or nothing material to call out
