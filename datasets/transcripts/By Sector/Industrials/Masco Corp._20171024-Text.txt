Thank you, Keith and good morning, everyone
As Dave mentioned most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items
Turning the Slide 6, our performance resulted in solid growth in both our top and bottom line
The third quarter of 2017 was our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth
On a reported basis sales increased 3% or 2% in local currency and when accounting for the Arrow divestiture, sales increase 4% or 3% in local currency
Foreign currency translation favorably impacted on third quarter revenues by approximately $15 million, as the euro strengthened against the US dollar
North American sales increase 2% or 3% x-Arrow due to the demand for our repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum, as we continued to experience strong consumer demand for our better and best product offerings, particularly our KraftMaid, Milgard and Delta a higher and showroom product
As Keith mentioned, our Q3 results were adversely impacted by the devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida in Puerto Rico
We estimate the revenue impact of these storms for the full year will be approximately $20 million, approximately $15 million in the third quarter split nearly evenly between the Plumbing, Decorative Architectural and Cabinetry segments and a $5 million in the fourth quarter that we expect will largely impact the Cabinetry segment
International sales increased 4% in local currency, as each of our international Plumbing businesses continue to drive growth
Gross margins expanded approximately 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 33.6%, largely due to the improvement of our North American Windows business
Our SG&A as a percent of sales matched prior year at 18.3% as we continue to leverage our volume, while making strategic investments to drive profitable growth
We delivered solid bottom line performance, as operating income increased 8% to $296 million with the operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 15.3%
And our EPS $0.50 in the quarter, an improvement of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Turning to Slide 7, our Plumbing segment continues to deliver strong results
Segment sales increased 6% and excluding the impact of currency increased 4%
This solid performance was driven by growth in our faucet, shower and spa businesses
Foreign currency transition favorably impacted this segment sales by approximately $13 million in the quarter
Our North American sales grew 4% in the third quarter, as we experienced strong consumer driven demand from industry leading brands, with wholesale, large retail and dealer customers
Our international Plumbing sales increased 6% in local currency
Hansgrohe continues to benefit from investments in brand, design and innovation
These investments, along with their focus on growing in key markets is yielding results and they experience strong double-digit growth in both Germany and China
Operating profit for the segment decreased 2% in the quarter, as the strong drop through on incremental volume was more than offset by approximately $10 million of increased strategic growth investments in other variable expenses
Turning to Slide 8, the Decorative Architectural product segment grew 3%
This performance was driven by another quarter of strong double-digit growth of our BEHR PRO initiative
We believe this segment will be the quickest to recover from the hurricanes as we are experiencing strong orders for our primers and interior paint in the affected areas
Liberty Hardware also contributed to topline performance, as it continues to benefit from the expansion and growth in it - of its innovative shower door program and in the eCommerce channel
As we mentioned in our second quarter call, Liberty continues to win new retail programs
It was awarded an expanded cabinet hardware program
This program was originally planned to set in the third quarter and now will be set in the fourth quarter
We anticipate spending approximately $8 million in reset costs in the fourth quarter on this program
In the segment operating income in the third quarter decreased $7 million, driven by an unfavorable price-to-commodity relationship as we discussed last quarter
We believe that the third quarter experienced the greatest impact of increased input cost and we expect this relationship to improve as we go into the fourth quarter
Turning to Slide 9. In the Cabinetry segment sales declined 4%
This is principally due to additional loss builder business in both the United States and in the UK
Our repair remodel business continues to perform well in the quarter
KraftMaid had solid performance in the home center and dealer channels, delivering double-digit growth through increased volume
Segment profitability declined in the third quarter by $1 million, driven by reduced volume and the incremental cost of approximately $6 million
And we mentioned at our second quarter call, related to the anti-dumping duties and countervailing tariffs on imported Chinese plywood and the new KraftMaid product launches, we have mitigated the impact of these duties through supply chain and other initiatives, do not anticipate them to have a material impact going forward
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales matched the third quarter of 2016, excluding the divestiture of ARROW Fasteners sales grew 9%
This strong performance was driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S
Window business which grew 12% in the quarter
Milgard's strong growth was due to favorable pricing, increased volume and a favorable mix shift toward our premium window and door products
Segment profitability in the quarter increased $33 million over the prior year, driven by the lapping of last year’s warranty expense, favorable pricing and cost savings initiatives
We are extremely pleased with the rapid progress that the team has made on Milgard's turnaround and an improved result delivered in 2017. As a reminder, our fourth quarter sales and operating profit will be impacted by approximately $18 million and $5 million respectively, due to our sale of Arrow Fastener and as we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we expect to receive topline growth and mid-single digit margins in the segment the full year despite the sale of Arrow
And turning to Slide 11, ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity
Working capital as a percent of sales increased 140 basis points versus prior year to 14.3% principally due to higher inventory to support our growth in new program wins
We believe we will have this inventory work down to a more normalized level by the end of the year
And during the third quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation and repurchasing approximately 4 million shares valued at approximately $178 million
And with that, I'll turn – now turn the call back over to Keith
Yes
So Stephen we did see some commodity inflation, Chris I should say, I'm sorry
We should see some commodity inflation - we did see some comedy inflation in both those segments in the quarter and to do [ph] we share that on our second quarter call
That said, there were also some incremental expenses that we incurred in our Plumbing segment, you know, some strategic growth initiatives
One of the things that - I think some of the things that are included in that, one, we had a little bit of a shop inefficiency
We had a new distribution center go live in Germany for our Hansgrohe unit and that caused us a little bit of headwind in the quarter
We do expect that that should be short lived and were pretty much through that right now
At the same time you know, some of the strategic investments that we incurred, some incremental display in advertising cost as we are now nationally resetting our displays in our dealer customers across the United States and we probably - you know, we - what we decided to do was pull forward some of that expense, we were going in a fairly modest clip and given the strength of the plumbing unit it has been seeing we thought we would accelerate some of that spend
So you'll see some of that hit in the third quarter and you’ll also see some of that hit in the fourth quarter
I'd say probably $5 million of incremental spend related to that display set - those displays being set in the third quarter maybe 5 to 10 in the fourth quarter as well
So as we accelerate some of that spend
On the paint side you know, we did see some raw material inflation and as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do think that we were most impacted by the price commodity relationship in the third quarter and going forward that should ease a little bit going into the fourth quarter and beyond
Yeah
So the reason they became its – the Cabinets segment is experiencing spill over from the hurricane impact is, if you think about the way the projects work, the cabinets are one of the last things to get set when home is really - you know, is been damaged and it gets rebuilt
So they have to go through flooring, electrical plumbing, drywall paint and all that other before people set their cabinets
And so there is going to be a little bit of headwind in cabinetry going into Q4. But as we go into 2018 we do expect that we should see some tailwinds broadly across all of our product categories, as a result of the rebuilding efforts in Texas and in Florida
Good morning, Mike
Yeah, so in terms of what we saw on DIY gallon go to it was down just modestly, as we indicated our Pro business was up double-digits
You know, in terms of your first question around pricing discipline within the industry you know, we don't expect any change in that dynamic going forward
You know I - everyone - I can't speak for everyone else, but just given how we look at our – and serving our major customer we're very focused on supporting their strategy of both serving the DIY consumer with the best experience, the best quality of paint and the best service in the industry, as well as really growing our share with the Pro
So we see no change in that dynamic whatsoever
So we're going to start that program with one of the large retailers and as expect you know, we were largely expect to set that in September and with the storms impacting you know, a big part of the country, they just elected to delay that a couple of weeks, so nothing significant there
The reason we're accelerating this investment Mike is because it's working for us, I don't know if you've had a chance to get out to the market and see some of our dealers and our showrooms, but fundamentally these are the best displays that are out there
We're displaying our showering program more - more strongly
We've gained additional, I think its two to three linear feet in these displays as we lay them out and our customers in the showrooms are seeing good return on those investments
So that's the reason why we're so bullish on this investment because the initial sets are performing so well
Keith, if it helps in paint, we really haven't changed our outlook from last quarter where we talked about for the full year mid-single digit growth and modest margin erosion
I'd also say John that you know, you know they are equally advertising our product as well in the marketplace, it’s not just solely
So there's a great partnership on the advertising side with Home Depot on that front as well
And Dennis, maybe just one point of clarification, specifically in the third quarter, the way we probably look at it as if you take the hurricanes out and the impact of ARROW, we're closer to 5% top line growth
So just you know, just the way we see it
Not a huge inflection
Yeah, I mean, I think there's really two things Dennis, that we see, principally one is, is just simply volume and how the fourth quarter shapes up there
I mean, that's the key driver, other than that it would be how we decide to control our expenses or put forward some expenses into the fourth quarter if we choose to do so out of 2018.
You know, we've talked about our long-term view on cabinets to be in that 5% to 7% growth range and the 13% to 15% margin
Certainly we're going to start to get and move in that direction in 2018. We're focused on the margin improvements particularly in the builder segment and then in the repair and remodeling our new product introductions on both KraftMaid and Merillat are performing well
So we expect to continue to march towards that 5% to 7% growth and 13% to 15% margin that we called out on our Investor Day
Megan, and as you look at you know our sales count on a combined basis DIY and Pro
I’ll tell you we were up low single digits in the quarter on a gallon basis
So overall feel pretty good about how we’re performing
You know, Alex, acknowledging that we're only kind of a quarter and a half into a 3 year guidance on those
You know, I think we're definitely on track and clearly one of the things that will help – that kills every piece was that the expanded camera hardware program that we're setting now
That's definitely a big component to helping us achieve if not exceed – get to the higher end of the range there
And then on the Pro side you know, we continue to do - we're very pleased with somewhere we're outperforming on the Pro and you know, I think we're right on track to achieve the Pro growth that we forecasted
Yeah, I think that's a good way to look at it Phil
You nailed the seasonality perfectly
That's exactly how the business develops over the course of the year
And given the strength that we're seeing as long as the volumes continue to hold out and the strong orders that we’re seeing continue to - you know we would expect that kind of development in 2018.
Yeah, it’s John
You're right, there is generally a lag that we see in our P&L
generally it’s about two quarters roughly speaking because of the length of our Asian supply lines
And so if you track copper and zinc it not a direct one for one, but its pretty close
You can see how that will play out over the course of time
Bob, its John
I think that's the way to think about it right, the way we prioritize our capital allocation as you know, always first and foremost invest in the business you know, to continue the growth of our existing businesses and you know CapEx as you've been watching runs pretty late too 2.5% of sales
And then after that it is rebalancing the M&A activity that keeps us talked about versus share repurchase activity and we were out in the marketplace pretty aggressively in the third quarter of buying back 4 million shares and then you're right you know we have raised the dividend four times over the course of the last four years and while we cannot commit the company we'll continue to look at that type of activity going into 2018.
I know - we do expect to do on the fourth quarter
We do expect the spend somewhere to be in that $5 million to $10 million range in Q4 and will there be similar activity in 2018 in the plumbing segment, yes there will
We’ll give you a better clarity and guidance on that in our February call when we have our plans all set for 2018. So you kind of spend in 2018 for those - for those displaced
Thanks
