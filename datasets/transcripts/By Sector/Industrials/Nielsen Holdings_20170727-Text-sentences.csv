1,"Overall, our business continues to deliver growth and margin expansion in a challenging environment"
2,"In our Buy segment, revenue remains weak as a result of challenging fast-moving consumer goods environment in the U.S"
3,"However, we continue to drive growth across the rest of the business in both Watch and Buy while also delivering margin expansion"
4,This is indicative of the strength of the portfolio and the resiliency of this business
5,Let me give a few more details on our total company performance in the second quarter
6,On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S
7,GAAP basis
8,"Revenue was just over $1.64 billion, up 3% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets in Buy, partially offset by 110 basis points of currency headwind and continued softness in our U.S"
9,Buy market
10,"Net income was $131 million, and net income per share was $0.37."
11,"Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and lower restructuring charges"
12,Moving to the right side of the page
13,"On a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was up 4.1% constant currency"
14,The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately two points to our revenue growth
15,"Our core revenue, which we define as total revenue less noncore or nonstrategic assets, grew 7.6% constant currency in the quarter and just under 4% excluding the Gracenote acquisition"
16,Iâ€™ll provide more color on the segments in just a few moments
17,"Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million, up 4.9% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.1%, up 25 basis points on a constant-currency basis"
18,"As Iâ€™ve mentioned in the past, we are running the productivity play with intensity and delivering cost efficiencies which help us expand margins and fund growth initiatives like electronic measurement in diary markets, expanding coverage in Buy and funding the Connected System"
19,"Free cash flow was $162 million, which was a record second quarter and was up 65.3% versus a year ago"
20,We remain on track for our full year plan of approximately $900 million to fuel growth and return cash to our shareholders
21,"Next, Iâ€™ll move to the segments, starting with Watch"
22,And the key takeaway is that our Watch segment continues to perform well and is delivering solid revenue and EBITDA growth
23,"Revenue was $821 million, up 10.9% constant currency"
24,"Excluding Gracenote, Watch revenue grew 3.5% constant currency"
25,"Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 16% and excluding Gracenote grew 4.7% constant currency, led by strength in total Audience Measurement"
26,"In addition to strength in national TV, we continue to see momentum in Digital Ad Ratings and Digital Content Ratings"
27,"Digital Ad Ratings campaigns grew 33% in the quarter, and we now have over 400 advertisers using the product, including all of the top 25 in the U.S"
28,"Digital Content Ratings also continue to see strong momentum as we increased penetration among top digital publishers, including Facebook"
29,"As expected, Audio was flat in the quarter"
30,Marketing effectiveness was up 18.6% constant currency as we leverage our Watch and Buy assets to help advertisers and publishers measure the return on investment and media spend
31,Other Watch was down 17.2% due to exiting part of the telecom product offerings in the U.S
32,and the exit of our legacy net ratings product in the U.S
33,", which is being replaced by Digital Content Ratings"
34,We also exited a content testing asset in the quarter as we continue to execute on our plan to prune noncore assets from the portfolio
35,"Watch adjusted EBITDA was $357 million, up 8.2% constant currency"
36,"Watch margins were 43.5%, down 1.1 points"
37,"Excluding 145 basis points drag from Gracenote, Watch margins were up more than 30 basis points constant currency, driven by productivity improvements"
38,Our Watch business continues to perform well and is delivering solid revenue and EBITDA growth
39,Turning to Buy
40,The key takeaway here is that revenue declines and margins were slightly better than 1Q as we navigate a tough U.S
41,market
42,"The rest of the developed markets remain resilient, and we see ongoing strength in emerging markets"
43,"Second quarter total Buy revenue was $823 million, down 2% constant currency"
44,Core Buy revenue was up 2.7% constant currency
45,"Our revenue in the developed markets was $510 million, down 1.2% constant currency behind continued weakness in the U.S"
46,", partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in the remaining developed markets"
47,"business, which is just under half of the developed market revenue, improved sequentially"
48,"Now, let me provide some additional color on what weâ€™re seeing in the U.S"
49,We continue to benefit from strong long term contract renewals with our largest clients
50,"However, as we have discussed, some of these clients are seeing challenging market conditions and cycling through significant cost cuts"
51,"And as a result, they make near term decisions about some of our products and services as they lower overall spend"
52,"We know that our measurement and analytics are critical and that, over time, clients must invest in the data they need to run their businesses"
53,"And in the second quarter, we saw this dynamic play out to some extent as clients spent a bit more behind some of their data and analytics needs"
54,Our business in the emerging markets remains robust
55,"Revenue was $296 million, up 10% constant currency"
56,The bets we have made to expand coverage and services are delivering broad based growth with both multinationals and locals
57,"Once again, we saw strong growth in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Greater China"
58,"In addition, margins in our emerging markets are expanding as we gain scale in key markets"
59,"Our Corporate Buy revenue was down 69%, reflecting our pruning of noncore Buy assets"
60,"Buy EBITDA was $163 million, down 1.8% constant currency in the second quarter"
61,"Our disciplined cost and commercial actions, along with improving operating leverage in the emerging markets, drove a slight increase in EBITDA margins despite a decline in total revenue"
62,Moving to foreign currency impact
63,I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance
64,We generally donâ€™t take on transactional risk so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes
65,"In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 110 basis points drag on revenue and a 40 basis points drag on EBITDA"
66,"If yesterdayâ€™s spot rates hold constant through 2017, then we expect a 40 basis points benefit on revenue and a 70 basis points benefit on EBITDA for the full year"
67,"Moving to 2017 guidance, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.46 and free cash flow guidance of approximately $900 million"
68,"We are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to plus 20 basis points, a constant currency expansion as a result of our cost out actions"
69,"Weâ€™re lowering our total revenue guidance to approximately 4% to reflect our first half results, our outlook in developed Buy and some updated timing on noncore product exits"
70,This includes approximately 6% core revenue growth and approximately 3% core revenue growth excluding Gracenote
71,There are no changes to our expectations for other financial metrics provided on the right hand side of the page
72,"And as we look at 2017 revenue growth, a few dynamics are playing out: one, our Watch business remains solid; two, we continue to see robust growth in the emerging markets; and three, we continue to plan for a tough U.S"
73,market
74,We now expect developed Buy revenue to be down 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis for 2017.
75,In the U.S
76,", we expect the second half to continue to improve versus the first half, though not enough to land us at our prior guidance"
77,We are not forecasting an improvement in the market environment for the back half of 2017.
78,"However, a review of our revenue pipeline for 2018, which includes renewals and new business, suggests an improvement in our business in 2018."
79,"This, along with an improving market environment, suggests a return to flat revenue in developed Buy for the full year for 2018 versus 2017."
80,"And lastly, we remain committed to our balanced capital structure that is funding growth while enabling us to return cash to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and share buybacks"
81,"And with that, Iâ€™ll turn it back to Mitch to provide more color on the quarter"
82,"Thank you, Toni"
83,Weâ€™re still working through our operating plan for 2018.
84,"However, as I said in my opening comments, our current revenue pipeline, which includes renewals and new business wins, suggests that developed Buy should be flat for 2018."
85,Iâ€™d point more to the back half of 2018 than the front half
86,Weâ€™ll obviously share more details when we give the 2018 outlook later in the year
87,"But from our clientsâ€™ perspective, we know that our data and analytics are critical to help them understand their performance and business drivers"
88,"And while theyâ€™ve had to make some tough cost tradeoffs, quite frankly, ultimately, theyâ€™ll need to invest in those data and analytics to help them grow their business"
89,"And what we see, as we look into 2018, are a few dynamics"
90,One is weâ€™re continuing to win with both retailers and manufacturers
91,Weâ€™re renewing 100% of our long-term contracts with our large global manufacturers
92,"Those contracts are staggered so even the ones that renewed with a lower base spending have price escalators through the contracts, and weâ€™re comping against a pretty tough 2017 environment"
93,"The last thing Iâ€™ll add is that our Connected System has actually given us incremental capabilities to sell in during renewals, and this has a pretty positive impact on the value of those agreements"
94,"On developed Buy, Iâ€™d look at the first half for trending purposes, and in the first half, our U.S"
95,business is down double digits
96,"The back half comps get a little easier, but as I said, weâ€™re not forecasting a change in the environment"
97,So the guidance framework that we gave of down 3% to 5% for developed Buy represents relatively easier comps in the U.S
98,"in the back half and tougher comps in Western Europe, which, quite frankly, was up high single digits in the back half of 2016."
99,Itâ€™s in line with the framework
100,It grew roughly 5% in the first half ex Gracenote
101,"So if you look at the trends for the first half, weâ€™re right on the framework"
102,Iâ€™d say a couple of things
103,One is national and digital are both solid in terms of what weâ€™re seeing in the marketplace
104,Where thereâ€™s been some pressure is local
105,"But quite frankly, there, weâ€™re excited about the prospects that we have in local with the new initiatives that weâ€™re going to roll out, the expansion of electronic measurement in the diary markets, the integration of set-top box data and the panel expansion benefits to our clients"
106,"So, we feel good about the framework overall"
107,"And again, if youâ€™re looking at the first half, weâ€™re in line with that framework"
108,"As I mentioned in my opening comments, we had about 2 points of inorganic revenue in the quarter"
109,Approximately 4 points were added from Gracenote and Repucom
110,That was offset by approximately 2 points from exits of segmentation and telecom and some of the research assets
111,"In Watch, we had approximately 9 points added from Gracenote and Repucom, offset by approximately 1 point drag from the Other Watch assets exits and telecom"
112,"And in Buy, we had approximately 4 points of drag from the exit of the assets and segmentation in customer research"
113,So that should give you the pieces of organic
114,"You have a little bit of timing there, obviously"
115,"If I look at Marketing Effectiveness, for example, organically, we grew close to double digits in the first half"
116,"Weâ€™re going to see strong demand and higher growth in the second half from our key products, and so we feel good about the 15% to 20% range for the year"
117,"If I look at Audience Measurement of Video and Text, as I said, itâ€™s in line with our framework if you look at roughly 5% in the first half"
118,I feel good about national and digital
119,"Local is where the pressure is, and we talked about the initiatives there"
120,"And then if I look at the corporate bucket, we have a few things rolling through there"
121,One is we actually sunset the digital rankings product in the quarter
122,We have also exited some assets in content testing
123,"So overall, I feel good about the guidance framework"
124,"Let me just sort of walk through that, just to give you the pieces"
125,So if I look at -- let me just start with Buy
126,"If I look at our Buy business, weâ€™re going to be down roughly 2.5% to 3% on a constant-currency basis for the year"
127,"That suggests that developed is down minus 3% to minus 5%; emerging, plus 8% to 10%; and then, corporate bucket is down 60%"
128,"And if I moved to Watch, no change to the framework there, up 11% to 13% in total for Watch"
129,"We see audio as being flat; Audience Measurement of Video and Text, up 14% to 16%; Marketing Effectiveness, up 15% to 20%; and then the Other Watch bucket, down 10%"
130,So that gives you the framework that we have for the total company
131,"Again, you always have a little bit of timing and lumpiness quarter-over-quarter, but we feel pretty good about the framework that we have from a guidance standpoint"
132,Yes
133,"So if I look at developed Buy, let me take it in a couple of pieces"
134,Iâ€™ll talk about the U.S
135,", and then Iâ€™ll talk about Europe"
136,"I look at the first half, again for trending purposes, in the first half, the U.S"
137,business was down double digits
138,"The comps do get a little easier in the back half of the year, but weâ€™re not forecasting a change in the environment"
139,So that guidance framework of being down 3% to 5% actually represents slightly easier comps in the U.S
140,in the back half
141,"But the comps actually for Western Europe are a tough -- are a little bit tougher because in the back half of 2016, Western Europe was up mid-single digits"
142,And what Iâ€™ll say about Western Europe
143,"is that we continue to be pleased with the recovery that we see in Western Europe that, again, began in the back half of 2016."
144,"So while the second half comps are a little tougher, I would say that the environment there is as good as itâ€™s been in 3 or 4 years in those markets"
145,"So again, that framework that we suggest says U.S"
146,"is a little bit better against a different set of comps, and Western Europe has a tougher set of comps in the back half of the year and net-net, youâ€™re about where you are in the first half of the year for our Buy business"
147,Sure
148,"So Iâ€™ll hit a couple of things, and Iâ€™ll ask Mitch to chime in on the remaining pieces of it"
149,"As I said, there are really three things, Dan, that sort of drive our outlook"
150,One is what we are seeing in terms of wins with both retailers and manufacturers in this environment that weâ€™re operating in
151,"Thatâ€™s been pretty important for us to continue to go after new business, and our teams are doing a pretty good job from a business development standpoint based on what we see in our early read"
152,The second thing I would say is that weâ€™re continuing to renew all of our long term contracts with our global manufacturers
153,"And while weâ€™ve had some of those contracts that renewed at a lower base, obviously, those contracts are staggered, and even the ones that renewed at a lower base have price escalators that move through the contracts as you go forward"
154,"And then the third piece, as I said, is sort of comping against a tough 2017 environment"
155,We expect to see some improvement there based on our most recent discussions with our clients
156,"And as I think about sort of the impact of the Connected System, I would say two things"
157,"One is that we do expect some revenue from the Connected System, some of which will be incremental"
158,", specifically revenue from the Connected Partner Program"
159,"But really, the second dimension is the one where we see the Connected System is actually giving us incremental things for our commercial teams to go sell and do renewals, and thatâ€™s actually given us a positive impact on some of those agreements"
160,Our primary focus next year is going to be on conversions
161,"And we expect that to ramp through the back half of the year, but the incremental revenue and the promise that we see from the Connected Partner Program is actually a positive as we look into 2018."
162,Yes
163,So if I look at the U.S
164,"business down mid-teens in the first quarter, second quarter, it was down again high singles, and then we saw sort of mid-singles across the rest of the developed world"
165,So those are sort of the pieces that are there
166,"And again, environment is still tough in the U.S"
167,", and we feel pretty good about the recovery that weâ€™re seeing, particularly in Western Europe, that really began in the back half of last year"
168,"And I canâ€™t reiterate enough how pleased we are with that recovery and the fact, that, that environment is as good as itâ€™"
169,s been in the last three or four years
170,"Yes, just, so from a guidance standpoint, youâ€™re right, the key pressure from a core standpoint is actually in developed, where weâ€™re now guiding being down minus 3% to minus 5%"
171,That is the key driver to what you see in the core revenue number coming down
172,"From a Gracenote standpoint, no change in terms of our expectations there"
173,The business is off to a great start
174,The integration is on track
175,The teams are excited about some of the commercial opportunities that Mitch mentioned
176,So no change to our Gracenote outlook there
177,The business is off to a really good start
178,I would say the margin profile is similar
179,"But what I would say on Buy, as youâ€™re thinking about margin profile, is really more around our cost actions, and the cost actions that we took there were really aimed at rightsizing our business for the current market realities"
180,We took restructuring charges over the past three quarters to fund these actions
181,"These actions were in addition to our normal productivity plays, and theyâ€™re helping us mute the impact of a softer revenue environment"
182,"And quite frankly, the other thing is none of these actions impact our ability to invest in our key initiatives"
183,"So as youâ€™re thinking about margin profile, just know that weâ€™ve got a number of cost actions that began in the back half of last year that are going to roll all the way through 2017, and that is the reason why we raised the EBITDA margin guidance and the big contributor to us maintaining our EPS guidance for the year"
184,Yes
185,Western Europe is probably 35% to 40% of the developed market business
186,"Yes, just a little bit under 50% this quarter"
