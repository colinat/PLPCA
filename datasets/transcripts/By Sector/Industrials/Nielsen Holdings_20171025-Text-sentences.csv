3,"However, growth and margins continue to improve in the emerging markets"
4,In Watch weâ€™re driving revenue and EBITDA growth behind our total Audience Measurement and Marketing Effectiveness initiatives
5,Resiliency remains a key attribute of our overall portfolio
6,Let me give a few more details on our total company performance in the third quarter
7,On the left side of the page are our results on a U.S
8,GAAP basis
9,"Revenue was just over $1.64 billion, up 4.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment and the emerging markets and Buy, partially offset by softness in our U.S"
10,Buy market
11,"In addition, foreign currency rates added 90 basis points to our revenue growth in the quarter"
12,"Net income was $146 million, up 12.3%, and net income per share was $0.41 up 13.9%"
13,"Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and lower restructuring charges"
14,"Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis total revenue was up 3.6% constant currency"
15,The net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 2 points to our revenue growth
16,Our core revenue which we define as total revenue
17,less non-core or non-strategic assets grew 5.7% constant currency in the quarter
18,I will provide more color on the segments in just a few moments
19,"Adjusted EBITDA was $522 million, up 4% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.8%, up 12 basis points on a constant currency basis"
20,Our margins were driven by favorable mix and cost savings efforts that are driving efficiency and finding growth in both Watch and Buy
21,"Free cash flow was $425 million, which was a record third quarter and was up 20.4% versus a year ago"
22,We remain on track for our full year plan of approximately $900 million to fuel growth and return cash to our shareholders
23,Next Iâ€™ll move to the segments starting with Watch
24,The Watch segment continues to deliver solid revenue and EBITDA growth
25,Revenue was $838 million up 9.7% constant currency and net of acquisitions and dispositions contributed approximately 7 points to our Watch revenue growth
26,Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 16.5% on a constant currency basis
27,"Excluding Gracenote, it grew 4.6% constant currency, led by strength in National TV and Digital"
28,"Digital Ad Ratings campaigns grew 44% in the quarter and we now have over 400 advertisers using the product, including all of the top 25 in the U.S"
29,"Digital Content Ratings, Digital and TV ratings and out-of-home measurement were also positive contributors to our third quarter growth"
30,"Audio was down 7.3% constant currency in the quarter due to the timing of ratings deliveries, which skews quarterly growth rates from time-to-time"
31,This dynamic represented about 130 basis points drag on Watch growth in the quarter and about a 60 basis points drag on the total company
32,"Importantly, we expect audio to be roughly flat for 2017, consistent with the framework I gave for the year"
33,Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.6% constant currency as we continue to leverage Watch and Buy assets to help advertisers and content publishers measure the return on investment in media spend and execute Audience Based Buy
34,"Other Watch was down 19.2% constant currency due to the previously announced exits, a part of the telecom product offerings, content testing assets and our legacy net ratings product in the U.S"
35,Watch adjusted EBITDA was $390 million up 7.7% constant currency
36,Watch margins were 46.5% down 84 basis points in constant currency
37,"Excluding 138 basis points drag from Gracenote, Watch margins were up 54 basis points constant currency"
38,Our Watch business continues to perform well and is delivering solid revenue and EBITDA growth
39,"Turning to Buy, the key takeaway is that year-to-date Buy revenue trends are in line with the framework we gave in 2Q, with continued strength in the emerging markets offset by a soft U.S"
40,"Third quarter total Buy revenue was $803 million, down 2.1% constant currency"
41,Core Buy revenue was roughly flat on a constant currency basis
42,Previously announced dispositions were a 2 point drag to our Buy revenue growth
43,"Our revenue in the developed markets was $491 million, down 5.4% constant currency behind continued softness in the U.S"
44,and a tough comparison in Europe
45,The Developed Buy results year-to-date are in line with the full year framework we gave in the second quarter
46,Let me provide some additional color on the U.S
47,Sequentially the revenue declines are improving although the environment remains tough
48,"As we have discussed, some of our clients are cycling through their own significant cost cuts and lowering overall spend"
49,"We expect this trend to continue for the next few quarters, however we also know that our measurement and analytics are critical and that over time clients must invest in the day-to-day need to drive growth and run their businesses"
50,"In addition, we are investing in coverage initiatives that will present growth opportunities for us in 2018 and beyond"
51,We look forward to sharing more details at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks
52,Our business in the emerging markets is exceptionally strong
53,"Revenue was $297 million, up 10.8% constant currency"
54,We are adding coverage and scale to drive broad based growth and margin expansion in all of our key markets
55,"Our corporate Buy revenue was down 54.5% constant currency, reflecting pruning of noncore Buy assets that we have previously flagged"
56,"Buy EBITDA was $145 million, down 5.2% constant currency in the third quarter"
57,We are investing in growth and efficiency initiatives across our businesses that will help us expand coverage and drive significant margin upside in Buy by 2020.
58,"Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance"
59,"We generally donâ€™t take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes"
60,"In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 90 basis points increase in revenue and an 80 basis point gain on EBITDA"
61,"If yesterdayâ€™s spot rates held constant through 2017, then we expect a 40 basis point benefit on revenue and an 80 basis points benefit on EBITDA for the full year"
62,"Moving to 2017 guidance, we are maintaining our full-year guidance highlighted by EPS of $1.40 to $1.46 per share and free cash flow of approximately $900 million"
63,On the right hand side we have updated our restructuring expense to approximately $85 million and D&A to approximately $650 million
64,"Lastly, we remain committed to our balanced capital structure that is funding growth while enabling us to return cash to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and share buybacks"
65,"With that, Iâ€™ll turn it back to Mitch to provide more color on the quarter"
66,"Yeah, thanks Toni"
67,So year-to-date our Developed Buy revenue is down 4.6% and thatâ€™s actually in line with the full year framework I gave last quarter
68,"As we have been saying all along, we know that our measurement and analytics are critical and that over time clients must invest in the date they need to run their business"
69,"In the second quarter we saw this dynamic play out as clients actually spent a bit more behind some of their data and analytics needs, and this spending can be a little lumpy from time-to-time and in 3Q we actually saw a bit less spending"
70,The second thing Iâ€™ll say is that the U.S
71,"improved sequentially after being down double digits in the first half and as I said in the second quarter, we expected a better second half and it played out that way in 3Q as the U.S"
72,was actually down mid-singles in the third quarter
73,"You know in Western Europe we said that weâ€™d have tougher comps in the second half, but the environment is as good as"
74,weâ€™ve seen it in three or four years
75,Western Europe actually grew high singles in the third quarter of 2016 which we did not expect to repeat
76,But on an underlying basis the demand is still pretty strong there
77,"And then as it relates to the framework that we gave, you know we gave a framework of down 3% to 5% in 2017."
78,"Year-to-date we are down 4.6% as I said and with only quarter left in the year, I would expect this to be at the lower end of the year just given those results and the environment that we see for our FMCG clients"
79,"Okay, thanks Andrew"
80,Let me hit the organic revenue again
81,"As I mentioned in my opening comments, we had about 2 points of organic revenue in the quarter"
82,"So on a total Nielson basis, our organic revenue was up 1.5%"
83,I also remind you again that we had about a 60 basis points drag from Audio timing in the third quarter that impacted that number
84,"And Watch, our organic revenue is about 3%"
85,"Again we had about eight points added from Gracenote, offset by approximately a point from some of the other Watch assets"
86,And then in Buy our organic revenue was flat and again thatâ€™s 2 points a drag from the exit of assets and segmentation and customer research
87,And just a couple of things Iâ€™ll add to that
88,"One is, if I point to sort of the audience measurement in video and text, if you look at our growth there in the quarter its up close to 5%, thatâ€™s in line with our framework"
89,Iâ€™ll say that our national and digital businesses remain solid and
90,you know we also some improvement in our local business in the quarter as well
91,"The numbers in Watch organically overall again being up about 3% actually had about 130 basis points drag from audio as I alluded to, so weâ€™ll be up a little bit over 4% without that impact"
92,I think what you can expect from our Watch business is
93,"weâ€™ve said many times is, itâ€™s sort of a consistent steady growth"
94,The initiatives that we have added to the portfolio have made this a growth to your business than it has been historically and we are pretty pleased with the execution by our teams and the adoption of those products in the market place
95,I think I would add to that is our business internally is stabilizing and even as the market continues to be challenging
96,Fundamentals of our business are improving
97,"Weâ€™ve been given a lot more focus to retailers in response to really what you have pointed to and what we are focused on is all the things that we canâ€™t control, so that we can manage through some of the impacts of the things that we canâ€™t control and Iâ€™m really pleased with the trajectory of our business in the developed markets and especially the U.S"
98,business
99,"Yeah, so we do expect some revenue from the connected system"
100,"Some of which will be incremental, specifically the revenue from the connected partner program"
101,The second dimension as I mentioned earlier is that the connected system has actually given us some incremental capabilities to sell in during renewals and this is actually having a positive impact on those agreements
102,We are starting to see some new client wins that are based on the capabilities of the connected system and weâ€™ll have some announcements to that affect in the future
103,"But as Mitch said, our primary focus really is on conversions and we expect that ramp to be in the back half of next year"
104,and we are getting very good client feedback and the teams are executing well
105,"Yeah, so a couple of things"
106,"On marketing effectiveness, you know we saw our marketing effectiveness assets this quarter deliver 15.6% growth, that was all organic, so no acquisitions are relevant in that numbers and thatâ€™s really driven by the progress that weâ€™re seeing with Nielsen Catalina Solutions, the Marketing Cloud, Repucom, they were all up double digits"
107,So we do see strong demand and higher growth in the second half on those products and we feel good about the 15% to 20% range
108,"In terms of Visual IQ, this is an acquisition that weâ€™re actually really excited about the capabilities of Visual IQ, because it is falling right in the suite space of an area that has very high demand from our clients around marketing mix modeling and multi touch attribution"
109,The revenue contribution wonâ€™t be significant
110,This really is a Buy versus Build situation for us where we actually get to market faster with a much better product
111,"It will actually cannibalize some of the revenue in our existing business in the near term, but longer term it will be accretive to growth"
112,"And then in terms of digital, while we donâ€™t break out necessarily our digital revenue"
113,", we feel pretty good about a few things"
114,"Number one, the progress that we are making with Digital Content Ratings and Digital Ad Ratings and digital TV ratings are all products and progress that is accretive to the growth rate in the Watch business"
115,"So to the earlier question around whether or not we are seeing incremental growth in the business, those things are actually contributing to the growth of the business and its why weâ€™ve"
116,been you know sort of marching along at a pretty steady growth rate in our Watch business over the last couple of years
117,"And then on your last point on other Watch, weâ€™ll be on track for the prior framework of down 10% for the year in 2017."
118,"Yeah, on the Audio timing, you know we saw the results in the quarter being down roughly 7%"
119,"So as youâ€™ve seen us report from time-to-time, the timing of the deliveries of an Audio will impact our growth rates"
120,So last year in the third quarter we had more of the deliveries in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter this year
121,Itâ€™s a little bit more balanced
122,so you saw that skew the rates
123,That should balance out between the 3Q and 4Q results
124,"On an underlying basis, we expect the Audio business to be you know roughly flat for the year, which is in line with the framework that we gave"
125,"I mentioned earlier to the question from Toni, that client CEOs are clear, that they know they need to invest in growth in their business but only some of them have actually started to take action of that yet"
126,and so thatâ€™s really going to be the wildcard
127,"Yeah, so we gave a framework last quarter on this and"
128,Iâ€™ll just reiterate that
129,We said our total Buy business is down 2.5% to 3%
130,On a year-to-date basis we are at about 2.6% down
131,Developed Buy we said is going to be down minus-3 to minus-5 year-to-date
132,As I said we are at about 4.6% and given that we have one quarter left in the year
133,We donâ€™t expect improvement in the fourth quarter
134,Emerging markets 8% to 10%
135,"You know weâ€™ve been trending towards the high end year-to-date, just a little over 10% and then corporate is down 60 year-to-date, weâ€™re down 54.5."
136,So that gives you the pieces for the Buy business being down 2.5% to 3%
137,On the Watch business we said up 11% to 13% year-to-date
138,Weâ€™re at 10.6%
139,Audio is going to be flat
140,We had a 130 basis points headwind in the third quarter that wonâ€™t repeat on the Watch side of our business
141,Audience measurement in Video and Text
142,", 14% to 16% marketing effect is 15% to 20% and other Watch as I said down 10%"
143,So that just give you the framework for how we see the guidance shaping up
144,and we said new change to our overall guidance
145,Weâ€™
146,"ll give guidance on 2018 in our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, and weâ€™"
147,ll unpack all the details at that time
