47,I'd be pleased to answer your questions
48,Question-and-Answer Session
49,"The transition of production to the new CF, XF and soon the LF vehicles"
50,", that's all gone very well"
51,So production ramp-up has gone without any challenges
52,And so we're moving into the next phase with the vocational trucks and getting ready to transition with the new LFs
53,So all that has gone very well
54,"Yes, Harrie has some thoughts here"
55,"I think one of the great things that is just coming online is not necessarily tied to the launch of the new products, is the Westerlo cab paint shop, which does have the latest state-of-the-art paint robotic applications in the industry"
56,So it's a fantastic plant
57,"If you ever get a chance to go to Europe and visit DAF's facilities, that would be certainly be a stop because it does have state-of-the-art robotics and the quality and the finish of the products is great"
58,"Yes, Jerry"
59,"As I mentioned, I think that the commercialization of that is several years away, probably outside a reasonable planning window for any significant adoption"
60,"Battery packs are still very large, they're heavy, they're expensive"
61,"And so there's really -- while we need to be ready for that technology, the commercial viability of that has some ways to go"
62,"So I don't think that's going to be something that we're going to be factoring into thoughts about margins, et cetera, in the near term"
63,I think it's a midterm technology that we'll see
64,"And first, it will be in vehicles -- the smaller vehicles and vehicles that aren't in the mainstream"
65,"like, say, port applications or refuse trucks, something like that"
66,Okay
67,Let's talk about technology
68,"Obviously, we've just opened our office in Silicon Valley"
69,"And so we have a lot of relationships before we opened the office, and we'll continue to build relationships for future technologies in the areas of connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, including autonomous, electrification"
70,All those things are things that we're involved with currently and will continue to be involved with
71,"I don't see that will impact -- we are projecting that our R&D spend will go up somewhat next year, but in terms of gross margins, I don't see that being a factor in the near term at all"
72,"With respect to customers, the feedback from discussions with customers is, I think, pretty optimistic about their prospects, what they're seeing in terms of demand and, more recently, some favorable freight pricing"
73,"So what we're hearing from customers is generally positive, at least orders as high as last year"
74,"I think it will continue to be dominated by the on-highway fleet guys, but vocational is very good"
75,There's lots of construction in certain parts of the country
76,"And if there is an infrastructure plan that gets implemented, that will bode well for the demand for vocational trucks as we start next year as well"
77,What we've seen is relatively steady pricing
78,"And at this market level, I think that's what we're anticipating from a pricing standpoint"
79,You're correct about the used truck market there
80,Prices are firming
81,And I think most of our guys and the folks we talk with feel like that used truck prices have bottomed and are stabilizing and have some upside
82,"On the used truck side, we're starting now to see more of our newer model trucks being returned off lease, so that's a positive sign that we'll see over the next 12 to 18 months"
83,"For now, we're thinking that next year is somewhere in the 3% to 5% range for Parts revenue growth for next year, but we'll see how it develops"
84,"Obviously, the demand is there"
85,We're continuing to add dealer location
86,Our team has got great programs and really making it easier all the time for our dealers and customers to do business with PACCAR Parts
87,We're adding distribution capability
88,"We're just starting the construction of a new facility in Toronto, and we'll continue to increment our distribution capability in the coming months and years"
89,So we feel good about the prospects
90,"And right now, 3% to 5% is our thinking about next year globally"
91,"I think as we sit here today, I mean, it's a great product to offer, but we have competitors in the market"
92,And so we're going to be able to earn what the customer is willing to pay
93,"And so at this point, pricing feels like it's a pretty steady proposition in both Europe and North America"
94,I think we're pretty sort of focused on the dollars
95,And so I would think the dollars will be pretty comparable to third quarter levels
96,So I don't see any significant increase in the fourth quarter
97,"No, I'd say segment-wise"
98,", I think we anticipate similar mix of our sales to what we've seen in 2017, which is in Europe, DAF continues to be a industry leader in the tractor segment, continues to focus on growing their vocational volumes"
99,And the new trucks that they've just launched will enhance their capability in that arena
100,"And in North America, I think we anticipate that the growth in the market will come in really all segments, both the on-highway as well as some vocational"
101,So I don't see any particular segment mix or customer mix sort of affecting our sales next year
102,"So I think if you look at this year, U.S"
103,"is probably flat to maybe a little bit down year-over-year, but Canada has bounced back"
104,The Canadian market this year is stronger than it was in 2016.
105,"I think next year, I think, we expect the U.S"
106,will be the area where a lot of the growth will occur for U.S
107,and Canada
108,"And Mexico, it should be another good year in Mexico, expect the market to be comparable"
109,Election years in Mexico sometimes have a little bit of an uptick because of some of the stimulus that gets added to the economy
110,So that could be a potential upside for Mexico next year
111,"Yes, I don't have any perspective on that, and I don't think that makes any sense, but"
112,Harrie's got some thoughts on that
113,"Yes, Seth"
114,"The big thing is that DAF has a 2-week shutdown during the third quarter, and plus they're building on basically a single shift during a couple weeks before and after that shutdown period"
115,"And they're building about 1,000 trucks a week, so that really is the big, big element"
116,And DAF has increased their production somewhat for the fourth quarter
117,So the combination of those is really -- the really big effect is the absence of the shutdown days from the third quarter
118,"Yes, I think it will be"
119,Probably 10% or so would be my guess
120,"So one of the things that has been beneficial for DAF is the fact that there's more sales this year outside of Europe, the European truck registration market"
121,"So you look at what we're selling into Russia, selling into the Indian region and South America, into Australia, into Africa, so all those things have supplemented DAF's build rate during the course of this year"
122,"Right now, I guess I would say I expect gross margin for next year to be comparable to what we're seeing in 2017 at the market size"
123,estimates we've provided
124,"I would say that if you look at the build rates for DAF and Peterbilt and Kenworth where they're currently at, if those build rates were able to be sustained for all of next year, the markets would probably be at the upper end of our estimates that we've provided for 2018."
125,"Yes, mid-14%, yes, plus or minus"
126,"Well, I think a big increase in fuel efficiency came with the engines that were launched this year"
127,"So DAF, 7% was a combination of fuel efficiency gains from the engine as well as aerodynamics of the enhanced vehicle features"
128,"And Peterbilt and Kenworth had a 4%, 5% increase at the beginning of this year with the model year '17 engine"
129,"So the next big increment, I think, will be in the 2020, 2021 time frame as we continue on the path of working on the 2021 greenhouse gas regulations"
130,But there'll be ongoing increments each year as we have to get certified each year
131,and we continue to make investments in the capability of our hardware
132,But even more importantly is the capability of our software
133,"So we're investing a lot more in our company today in software capability, software development for engine programming, truck control units and the integration of all that into a solid system"
134,"So that's where you're going to see some of the gains in the coming years, is that continuous improvement in the integration of all elements of the truck and the powertrain"
135,Yes
136,I think we're reasonably conservative at this point
137,And we haven't started the year and we're trying to predict what next year is going to be
138,I think we feel confident it will be a better year
139,"And we'll see, as the year goes on, how it progresses"
140,"Well, our team was just at the Fenatran truck show last week"
141,And I would say the optimism of the industry and our team is good as we enter 2018.
142,We've seen an increased quoting activity in the market
143,"We've increased our build rates as we've progressed through this year, and we'll start next year at even higher build rates"
144,So the market is recovering
145,We just launched a new truck for heavy haul applications in agricultural industry
146,And so that is going to give us some additional product capability in the market
147,So we're pretty bullish about what the near term looks like for Brazil in terms of being on the road to recovery and taking advantage of that and continuing to grow our share in that market
148,Yes
149,It's been a bit of a headwind
150,"Last year, we enjoyed some benefits, a bit of a tailwind, if you will"
151,And this year has been a bit of a headwind
152,"But I see next year -- again, it's not a significant effect"
153,"We do have the long-term agreements with our customers -- our suppliers, excuse me, that allow us to work those in ratably and work those into our pricing into the market"
154,So I don't see it being a significant item as we go into next year
155,It's actually down just slightly
156,"And when you compare our penetration this year to last year, we offer our customers the PACCAR option and the Cummins option"
157,"Cummins is a great, great partner of ours"
158,"And so it really depends a lot on who's ordering at a particular given time, but we continue to enjoy great success with the engine"
159,"It's very well received by the customers, and we continue to work on getting increased penetration"
160,So I'd say just down slightly a little bit this year compared to last year
161,"Andy, that portfolio is performing great and has for really post 2010."
162,And so any movement in those provisions typically has to do with the amount of the assets that we have
163,But the amount of actual credit losses that we're seeing are pretty isolated
164,And there's no indication that the customers' ability to pay is going to be affected anytime soon with pretty robust transportation markets in all the markets where we're doing financing at this point
165,"No, I don't think we've seen that"
166,"We've been able to -- we have a great value proposition for our customers' with our products, with the aftermarket support that we provide, with parts and really supporting the uptime of our customers, great financing product"
167,So I think the total package -- I mean we still are able to earn a premium with the quality of all the things that we provide our customers
168,"So we've not seen anything -- there's always the isolated instance or isolated deal or somebody may do something that you scratch your head about, but that's no general trend"
169,I think that's our current assessment
170,"I mean, there's obviously some upside potential as we progress through the year"
171,We'll see how that develops
172,"So right now, we're thinking 14.5%, plus or minus, from there"
173,And so the factories -- we've made some great investments
174,The factories are operating very efficiently
175,And we'll see how pricing develops during the course of the year
176,So I think somewhere between that 14% to 15% range is sort of where we think things will develop as we progress
177,"Typically, the extended backlog is longer-term buyers, fleet buyers"
178,"And so what fills in, in the shorter term is the stocking trucks, the smaller customers"
179,And the margins in the backlog are generally consistent with what we're building currently
180,So you're talking about compared to the third quarter of last year?
181,"So I think there, you've got the higher mix of trucks"
182,"You do have a bit of material cost headwind, and we continue to see some of the currency impacts with the British pound versus the euro and the Mexican peso"
183,"So those are just things that impact the margins, but we continue to work through those"
184,"And the opportunities for us to continue to grow the business, continue to generate good returns for our shareholders, we see those as -- continue to be consistent with what we've achieved in the past with respect to incremental margin"
185,"I would guess they're coming from warehouse distributors, would be where I would think we get most of our upside with our TRP brand and the ability to service and have greater access to second and third owners of really All Makes of trucks"
186,"I mean, obviously, whatever the warehouse distributor -- they're distributing, there are some private labels and vendor stuff"
187,And so we're getting better access to that customer base than what we've had previously when you're just going through the Peterbilt or Kenworth or DAF dealer network
188,"Well, I mean, just ongoing discussions with customers, with dealers and order activity is the sign that tells us how things are going"
189,And so order activity is aligned with the market estimates that we've provided
190,Yes
191,So our used truck inventory has declined progressively throughout this year
192,"And so as we end the third quarter, we're at our lowest level of used trucks that we've had"
193,"So we're well positioned with a good level of inventory to sell into the market, both out of our retail sales locations as well as through our dealers"
194,So we're right where we feel we need to be with respect to used truck inventories
195,"No, I think it's typically -- parts margins are typically driven by the mix of the product lines that we might sell during any given period, so proprietary versus vendor versus TRP versus PACCAR genuine"
196,So there's lots of different levels of parts
197,"And typically, the margin movement is affected more by mix than sales prices or material cost movement"
198,"I don't have those figures in front of me, I'm sorry"
199,I think all segments are interested
200,"But I think when you look at the economic reality, the smaller the vehicle, the more likely that technology has application"
201,So it's just going to be a while
202,There needs to be a breakthrough in battery technology for that really to be commercially viable for -- the higher up
203,you go in the truck market
204,So I think everybody is interested
205,"Everybody wants to know what we're doing, and we've got a lot of things that we're exploring"
206,"But the economic viability, as it stands today, like I say, it's more midterm than it is near term"
207,Good market
208,"This year, DAF has been able to increase its share up on the 15% range from 11% or 12% in some of the prior years"
209,"We have good dealer representation, good support for the product"
210,So it's a good market and one that we're taking advantage of as it currently sits
211,"I mean, used truck market is pretty steady"
212,", I guess I'd say"
213,"Again, one of the positive aspects that DAF and PACCAR Financial in Europe will experience is the fact that starting next year and on for the coming years, that there'll be more and more of the Euro 6 product that will be coming back off lease, coming in on trades"
214,And we'll have the newer models to sell in the used truck market
215,So overall demand at this point and pricing seems to be pretty steady
216,"At this point, it's a lot more talk than there is actual impact, what we're seeing in the market"
217,So that obviously goes into play in December
218,And so we'll see how it develops
219,"But right now, it doesn't feel like it's a significant element in truck orders and truck buying decisions"
220,There's no real areas of concern
221,"I'd say, at this point, that the bottom end of our range is conservatism"
222,"As I mentioned previously, if we continued with our build rates as they currently sit at DAF and Peterbilt and Kenworth, the markets would be at the upper end of our estimate"
223,So the lower end just really reflects some conservatism
224,"I think if you look at the -- probably the second half run rate for SG&A, some of the effect in the second half has been"
225,"there's just some little stronger currencies with respect to the euro, et cetera"
226,"So I think if you look at the second half run rate of SG&A, that's probably indicative of what we would expect for full year 2018 in terms of absolute dollars"
227,"So the revenue is just we have a bit of an increasing interest rate environment, we have higher assets and we had the higher mix of operating leases in our portfolio"
228,So there's several things that impact that
229,"As we think about next year, right now, we anticipate that the portfolio will continue to perform well, that our customers will have good economic conditions in which to operate"
230,And so credit losses will continue to be muted
231,"Used truck values seem to have stabilized, and so I don't think we'll see any challenges on the used truck side"
232,"So as it sits here today, we feel good about our prospects for 2018 in the Financial Services arena"
233,Probably at the pretax profit level because we sort of manage our R&D and SG&A more to a fixed cost
234,It's going to depend on how the year progresses and how material costs develop
235,And we're well positioned
236,"And at this point, again, I think margins would be in that 14% to 15%"
237,And whether they're at the upper end or lower end of that range depends on a lot of factors that are to be determined
238,"We'd like to thank everyone for their participation, and thank you, operator"
