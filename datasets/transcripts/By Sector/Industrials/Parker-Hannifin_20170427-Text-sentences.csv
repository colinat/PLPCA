61,Question-and-Answer Session
62,"Nathan, this is Tom"
63,Because aerospace was a little challenged with some extra development costs in the quarter that kind of deflated the marginal return on sales a little bit
64,"If you back that out, just look at industrial and then also take all the acquisitions out"
65,", we're in the mid-50%s"
66,"Now, I would not project a mid-50% MROS for us going forward"
67,"We tend to have the first quarter to up about that level, and then glide back down to a more steady state of plus 30%, but these margins are really, really stellar that we put up in this quarter"
68,"Okay, Jamie, I'll start then I'll hand it over to Lee for the markets"
69,"On MROS, I think with CLARCOR all in (27:43)"
70,you should see us do what we've historically done
71,If â€“
72,"that plus a little bit more, because everything we've done as a company, with the new Win Strategy, the fixed costs that we've taken out, simplification"
73,So I think you could model historical plus a little bit better
74,"On the integration, it's going terrific"
75,I'm very pleased with integration so far
76,"The teamwork between both companies basically becoming one, they are the talent that the cultural fit, all the synergies, very interesting, the synergies we thought when we're kind of looking at it, more isolated now that we're looking at it jointly"
77,"There is a lot of harmony between both teams looking at and saying we've created, this is a dynamite list"
78,So we're very encouraged and there is â€“
79,"as we go forward, we update you in August give you a better clarity as to the cost to achieve and the savings for that fiscal year, but we're off to a good start with that"
80,"And then on the markets, I would just tell you that's"
81,it's nice
82,â€
83,“ it's really nice
84,having sat in this room now for 10 quarters to have a quarter where we have an exciting organic growth story to tell you
85,"I mean, it's across pretty much board, and I'll let Lee give you the color on that"
86,Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
87,"LLC Sorry, Tom, just a follow-up on the incremental though, but in â€"
88,“ obviously it's very encouraging that you think you can do a little better than where we were historically
89,and you don't see sort of price cost is an issue
90,as well like that's not to be short-term
91,Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
92,LLC
93,Okay
94,"Sorry, Lee"
95,Go ahead
96,The trend â€
97,“ Joe this is Tom
98,"The trends through the quarter, North America and Europe showed steady progress through the quarter and Asia Pacific and Latin America were pretty much consistent, stayed at a high level for the quarter, and April is consistent with what we saw"
99,and it's reflected in the guide
100,"So, in general, I think Lee kind of hit it"
101,", we're encouraged, but couple of more quarters would just solidify that for us"
102,"John, I'll start at a high level and I'll let Cathy fill in, add any more details, but our goal is, we're about 3.2 times debt-to-EBITDA"
103,"Over the next 24 months to 36 months, we want to drive it down to the 2.0 debt-to-EBITDA"
104,"So, we're going â€"
105,"“ the cash flow, we're very proud of at almost 12%, CFOA, we're going to be using that to help pay down the debt and we're encouraged by what we've seen so far as far as synergies and our ability to put these businesses together, so we think cash will continue to be a very strong component of it"
106,But that's the focus is driving that down
107,"In fact, when you look at all the end markets in China, it's hard to find anything that's red"
108,"David, it's Tom"
109,We can't predict it at this point
110,"I mean I know everybody would like me to start talking about FY 2018 in April, but FY 2018 is hard enough to talk about in August"
111,So we'll give you the color on that
112,", we just started our process internally"
113,"So, I'm going to just ask you to wait until we get to August"
114,"Really, so I mean, have to go do that math, but part of it'll be (43:15) doing that math, but also, we'll be talking to our customers, looking at economic forecasts"
115,"So, it's not just trying to take current quarter and projecting it out and comparing it to prior periods"
116,It's actually looking and understanding end demand and what's going on
117,"So, we will do that, but that's not the only factor that will influence it"
118,"David, I think the best approach would be take it offline"
119,You and Robin and Ryan can talk about in the follow-up call
120,This is Tom
121,We actually think the supply chain side has a tremendous amount of synergies because CLARCOR is a very decentralized company similar to us
122,"However, they ran a very decentralized buying organization"
123,So they didn't leverage any of their spend or very little of the spend across their various businesses
124,"So, you've got leverage there, first, just by itself"
125,"But then combining it with our spend as well, you have that aggregation"
126,"So, we see big upside"
127,"And I think all of you know, we've been careful on breaking the buckets up, because obviously, some of those buckets are sensitive to how you"
128,â€
129,“ how we would disclose these things
130,"But you can rest assured, we have a very finite detail by major cost bucket and supply chain being one of the largest actually, and it's the natural things you would think of"
131,"The Win Strategy initiatives, corporate SG&A, supply chain, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities for both of our companies"
132,"And the advantage here is not just looking at one isolated, it's the combination, so looking at both of our manufacturing capabilities and leveraging that"
133,And just part of how we did â€
134,"“ we did this with our own insight and what's really been great is now with the CLARCOR team's viewpoint, and we've been spot on as far as in agreement as what we think we need to do, which has been very encouraging"
135,"I think what we'll certainly do is every quarter, starting in August we'll give you the projection that we think we'll do for that fiscal year as far as cost to achieve, then the synergies that we're going to get"
136,and then we'll update how we're doing every quarter against that
137,"The supply chain savings, I am not worried about disclosing that, so if that's something in particular that you'd like to see, we can provide more detail"
138,"I also don't want to scatter the herd on my suppliers either, so we'll have to think about how much of that we actually do"
139,But the team on the phone has to â€
140,“ you have to be very confident that we have this down to a very finite detail by major bucket
141,"There is various sensitivities as you disclose that, that we'll just have to consider, but certainly we're going to give you the total and"
142,how we're tracking against it
143,"Ann, it's Tom again"
144,"I guess the encouraging thing is there's been no negative surprises, it's all been positive reinforcement and affirmation of the assumptions we made"
145,And I am very pleased with the leadership talent and the strength of the organization
146,"I am pleased with the cultural fit, I am pleased with the fact that both teams are working as one"
147,"When I look at these synergies and there's been a lot of buy-in as to what we have to do to make both of our filtration businesses, the best filtration business in the world"
148,So â€
149,"“ and I'm knocking on wood, I couldn't be happier with the start"
150,Yeah
151,"Millie (52:47), it's Tom"
152,"Well, first of all, when we set those targets, they were top quartile performance threshold for our peer group and that continues to be a good number"
153,I am very happy to relook at that number once we've achieved it
154,I don't want to de-motivate the team by moving it before we've actually achieved it
155,"So, we're going to achieve it first"
156,", we're going to obviously continue to drive continuous improvement and we'll also look at what top quartile is running at that time because we see our abilities to continue to get more profitable all the time, but we're not going to move the 17% target until we actually achieve it"
157,Unknown Speaker
158,Okay
159,And then I guess just as a quick follow-up
160,"More of a clarification, I think, you mentioned price cost a little bit earlier in the Q&A session"
161,I just want to clarify
162,", you said, you don't think that that's going to be a challenge as the year goes on?"
163,"Joe, it's Tom"
164,"Again, I'd characterize it as early days still"
165,There's some things that we moved out more on division consolidations and those type of things
166,But we'll continue to look at that
167,and we'll certainly update you on the plans we might have there in the future
168,"But the bigger area that has, I think, the most upside is that whole revenue complexity that looking at the product line simplification, that last couple percent of revenue and the complexity associated with that want to service our customer to make it faster and better experience for them, but also to redesign our organization and our processes and SG&A cost that supports that"
169,"So I am very encouraged because every time we look at that, I still see tremendous upside"
170,"That part that I just described, the product line complexity is hard work, I've described this as hand-to-hand combat, you got to go part number by part number to go through that"
171,"So that's why I characterize that it's still very early days because a company of our size with the number of part numbers, there's still a lot of work we're doing"
172,"and we're very active on that, and I think you'll see that'd be a contributor for margin expansion for multiple years"
