0,"Thanks Cathy, and good morning to everybody and thanks for joining the call, we appreciate your interest in Parker"
1,So let me just make a few comments about general business conditions
2,and we will talk about the quarter
3,"So first on safety, that continues to be a top priority for the company"
4,"[Analysis] is the right thing to do obviously, but the focus on safety is driving an increased engagement from our people, which is in turn driving safety improvements across the company which is also impacting our operational improvements across the company as well, so"
5,I'm very encouraged by all of that
6,"You saw the announcement on orders, broad based increase across markets and regions"
7,The organic growth was greater than industrial production growth for the last three quarters in a row
8,so we're excited about that
9,The Win Strategy initiatives continue to generate improvements in both growth and operating margins
10,"If I would characterize business confidence in general, feedback from our customers [indiscernible] a very positive, so there is a nice general business confidence out there from an environmental standpoint"
11,"So it's actually been about two years, since we announced and introduced the new Win Strategy, so thought I will reflect back"
12,"I know it's kind of hard to imagine since it's been two years, but a lot has happened in two years"
13,"I think back the two years ago, we're in debt or pretty tough industrial climate, actually our second biggest down turn in sales in the history of the company"
14,and we performed better than we ever hard in any previous downturn
15,"But if you're looking for evidence on whether the new Win Strategy is working, I think if you look at the results of the last two years, I think it is clear and objective evidence that the strategy is working, you can see the numbers"
16,"The good news for all of our people who are listening, the people within Parker and our shareholders, this is still early days of implementation"
17,There is lots of upside with the new Win Strategy and we're excited about that
18,"So I wanted to say first of all thank you to all the Parker team members around the world for the great progress after two years from the launch and for being a partner in creating the new Win Strategy because when we went around and introduced it, they were a big part of creating the strategies that we're now rolling out"
19,"So let's move on to the quarter, great start, it's always nice to come out of blocks well"
20,"Starting with safety as we normally do, 24% reduction in recordable injuries which was great performance"
21,"And you look at the key performance metrics for the quarter, fully solid performance across all those, the sales was a first quarter record for us up 23%, organic growth slightly above 7%, order rates increased at double-digits and this is the highest level of order growth that we've had for a quarter, since Q4 of fiscal 2011."
22,The segment operating margins continue to make nice improvements and EPS for the quarter that was a first quarter record as well
23,"When you look at the change in the EPS, EPS increased 36% as reported and 48% on an adjusted basis, so"
24,really nice increases there
25,and we are on track to deliver strong operating cash flow going forward
26,"So just a quick comment or two on capital deployment priorities; so dividends continues to be our number one focus, increasing the dividends and maintaining our long standing track record of dividend increases"
27,"We're going to continue to invest in organic growth with our CapEx, it's the most efficient way to grow the company and we're going to maintain the 10b5-1 plan that we have in place for a consistent share buyback program"
28,and we're continuing to focus on bringing down the debt
29,So I want to talk about the outlook; so outlook was increased from an adjusted EPS standpoint by $0.60 at the midpoint from $8.80 to $9.40.
30,This reflects the first quarter [beat] that we had and increased organic growth estimates that we baked into the guidance
31,So for that we've increased total Parker organic growth from our previous guide at 3.7% to another new guide as 5.5% organic growth total company
32,"So now going forward, obviously we're going to continue driving the new Win Strategy"
33,"and I'm going to just make a quick comment or two about each one of the four goals, starting first with engage people"
34,"So this is really all about creating an ownership culture, because if you're an owner and if you think like an owner and act like an owner, it creates a level of intimacy, level of accountability with your area of responsibility that drives much better results"
35,"Second is premier customer experience; so we're going to focus on going from a service mindset to an experience mindset, have holistic experience interaction with our customers and our distributors"
36,"So obviously to create quality and delivery that's being easier to do business with that's being digital leaders in our space, so that's Internet of Things, the fee business those type of areas"
37,"Third goal is profit growth; so we want to grow organically faster than the market, that's the global industrial production mix"
38,And we're doing that through our growth initiatives and the Win Strategy as well as the new incentive plan that rolled out a couple of years ago that really underpins driving that kind of behavior on growth
39,Fourth goal is financial performance; so 17% segment operating margins is still our focus
40,Growing EPS 8% year-over-year or higher
41,"And the focus there for financial performance as well as big four initiatives we have under our new financial performance; the simplification, lean enterprise, strategic supply chain and value pricing"
42,"So one comment about CLARCOR, I'm sure it'll come up with the Q&A"
43,Integration is going very well
44,"Synergies are track, we've communicated to you"
45,And really the new filtration group is really acting as one team
46,and we're very proud of how that team has functioned and really it's one Parker team
47,", it's no longer a separate CLARCOR or a separate Parker team, it's just one combined Parker team"
48,"So in sum, we're looking forward to and anticipating a record year"
49,And we're really driving continues improvement across the board
50,And so with that I'm going to give it back to Cathy to give you more details on the quarter
51,So we're very pleased with the start of the year
52,"I think what we have going on here is a combination of couple of factors; sales growth, the lower cost structure that we have been working on past"
53,"but we will continue to work on to lower even further, integration of CLARCOR and the execution of the Win Strategy"
54,All of these forced together are combining to provide a very powerful combination that's driving us to project a record year in fiscal 2018.
55,"So again thank you to the global team for all your hard work, all your efforts and your dedication"
56,And I want to hand it off to Chelsea to start the Q&A portion of the call
57,Question-and-Answer Session
58,So Adam let me start that and then hand it over to Lee to give you more details
59,But what's changing in our guide is just looking at order entry over the last three months
60,Well it was interesting order entry was pretty consistent throughout the quarter both in North America and in international
61,"But in international particularly we saw Asia continue to be strong, Europe, Middle East and Africa region was growing in the low teens and Latin America"
62,was kind of in the low single digits
63,So that combination was pretty strong
64,"Aerospace grew plus 4%, that against a pretty tough comp of plus 14%"
65,"So when you put that all in and we looked at what we were projecting for the year and our feedback from customers and distributors, we looked at -- I'm looking at Industrial only, so we raised the whole guidance for the company at 5.5%"
66,But if you look at the Industrial piece by itself taking North America and Africa
67,"it's about 10.5% for the first half, and then 3.7% for the second half"
68,I recognize the second half is comparing to a plus 6% that we had in the second half of FY17.
69,So remember we really started clicking from an organic gross standpoint of January of this calendar year and so we're comparing against this
70,but there is still pretty nice growth on top of plus 6%
71,So I would say that -- let Lee comment about the details here
72,This is broad base for every end market and every region participating
73,So I will let Lee give you further color
74,Okay
75,Jamie this is Tom
76,"The international strength, because CLARCOR's end markets and legacy Parker end markets are the same, that's all one of the same as far as the strength that we saw across international"
77,"On the revenue synergies as I've mentioned before we have always -- we also working them hard, but we have always view them continuously to make sure we deliver on our commitment to all of our shareholders on the $140 million of synergies"
78,"Regarding the -- so on the revenue synergies, if some of you are trying to bake them into FY18, I would encourage you not to do that because even if we were going to publically disclose it, which we're not, we won't see any of that stuff realistically into FY19 anyhow"
79,So I would just encourage you on revenue synergies to factor based on the comments we're making on end markets and regions
80,"But on the savings target, overall $140 million, we still feel very good about that"
81,"And remember we formed these -- we've an integrated management office, we have got a great cadence around product management here"
82,"We have value creation teams all around a couple of the key synergy buckets; manufacturing, footprint, productivity, material, adjusted SG&A would be the major categories and all of them are on track"
83,So we're very encouraged by what we've seen both the fit the technologies culturally and the projected savings
84,So we feel very good about them
85,"Jamie, [the last thing]â€"
86,¦
87,"I think in general, China is not going to continue to grow at the pace that it's growing now"
88,And we look at some macro indicators like electrical output usage and rail -- freight rail usage
89,"And those are -- just naturally when you look at the comparables, China is going to glide from strong double digits to something that's going to be a low double digits"
90,but it's going to continue to be very good for us
91,But it's going to bump up against comparables that will make it -- it's going to have to glide down some more normalized type of growth plan there
92,"Mig before I let you ask the question, just thank you on behalf of all of us"
93,Go ahead and ask your question
94,Mig this is Tom
95,"On the order entry remember our -- on the Industrial portion of the business, our visibility will be typically like in that [6 to 8 week] standpoint"
96,So obviously we have a lot more visibility and confidence in the first half of the year and going into January
97,"So, but like I mentioned before for the first half Industrial 10.5% growth, again a little bit easier comps"
98,but that's reflective of what we did internationally -- industrially this last quarter and the order pattern that we're seeing
99,Then the second half is in that 3.5% range
100,Remember again that we had 6% organic growth
101,"the first two quarters of this calendar year, the last two quarters of our fiscal year"
102,"So I feel pretty good about that, given that on top of the 6% growth feels pretty good"
103,Especially when we were living in a world that was negative and we all were feeling like
104,if we got 1% or 2% growth it will be the new norm
105,So that kind of growth rate feels very good
106,It doesn't feel like we're too far over our SKUs
107,"And then of course we'll give you an update in January, if we think there is more there than that, we'll certainly give you an update in January"
108,"Ann, this is Tom, so we're still staying with the $140 million"
109,"The one thing that I do want to at least let people know, because this is obviously a part of our question, I think some of you should have seen we posted a whole -- [save the date], for our Investor Day in the spring of next year"
110,We picked that time because that would have marked the one year anniversary of the acquisition and we like to go in a lot more detail on how we are progressing in and what we think at that point
111,"But $140 million still feels like the right number and with a couple of more quarters we give you at the investor update, in the spring of next year, also might be lot smarter and educate us to where we think the number is going to land"
112,No
113,You know me and I probably won't be able to give you that
114,But you know it is our second or third largest country you know after the U.S
115,", with Germany and China kind of competing for that second spot"
116,But I would look at our Asia progression
117,It's not just the China only story
118,"We see really good effort across the entire region, so North Asia, Korea and Japan are probably better than I can remember in a lot of years"
119,India is having one of our better years than any
120,Then South East Asia is doing strong
121,"Australia has comeback from where it was, coming off of the bottom"
122,So for us the part
123,I feel good about with Asia
124,is that it's a broad based Asia story
125,", it's not a singular China story"
126,I think your point is spot on
127,"It is encouraging because you right, if you look at the PMIs across the regions it's very rare in my memory where you've gotten this much strong PMI activity pretty consistently across the board"
128,But I think this is a different
129,I think time period for Industrials
130,There has been a lot of data and analysis that we've done
131,When you look at the last 15 years for Industrials and this is going to be maybe a long way to answer to your question
132,"the '03 to '08 time period was a really strong Industrial time period, where Industrials kind of outpaced GDP driven little because of China and the whole globalization of Industrials"
133,Then we have the great recession '08 and to '09 and '10 starting to recover a rebound to '11.
134,And then most Industrials somewhat treaded water from '11 to '15.
135,And then we had the industrial recession which was really natural resource led '15 and '16
136,"and of course we have seen a recovery now start, beginning this calendar year"
137,"My feeling is this feels and as the word common sense made at the beginning that general business conditions and the sentiment from customers and distributors feels different than the previous eras I've just described, in more like an '03 to '08, but it's not going to have the same pull that China had back in that era"
138,So I look for Industrials to break out of their kind of treading water pattern that was in the '11 to '15.
139,Where that finally ends up nobody -- I'm not spotting up this day but this does feels slightly different
140,Trees don't grow to the sky so PMIs are not going to go forever
141,But I think what we have [influenced] have heard of a more sustainable industrial growth that what we have may be expected
142,I think number one we launched the new Win Strategy
143,", we're talking about 1.5% world"
144,"Doesn't feel like that right now, but when it lands we're all going to learn over the next several quarters and years"
145,"Ann, again I will say --"
146,"I'll continue, it's Tom"
147,"No, nothing out of the norm"
148,"Joe, this is Tom, if I could just add on"
149,"In general if I were to characterize whether its CLARCOR related or just on traditional restructuring, when we do planned closures, our teams tend to be more ambitious on thinking they are going to accelerate the timing of the closure"
150,"and we tend to let them run to a more aggressive target,"
151,so they can try to get things done
152,But we're always conservative on forecasting their savings that came from that recognizing the planned closures and the timing and all the announcements is sometimes tricky to coordinate all that
153,So we were conservative on the savings projections
154,", that's why you don't see us come out with our savings for this year and"
155,"the actual costs, what Q1 was like"
156,"you will see that come back up in Q2, Q3 and Q4 for the rest of the year"
157,"It's Tom, David"
158,And that's how I would characterize it
159,Andy
160,"this is Tom, just to tag on"
161,"One good indicator of whether we are okay or not is if you look at our total company backlog, it's basically stayed flat even with three quarters of a pretty, strong increases from the order entry standpoint"
162,"So if any of our customers are listening, we recognize we want to do better and improve to our delivery times with our customers"
163,But we've been able to absorb this pretty strong increase and not have our backlog go up
164,Andy
165,it's Tom
166,I think there is still lots of opportunities
167,"If I look at services, innovation, systems still a lot of opportunities there"
168,"Our distribution mix is still lighter than we would like to see it internationally, so there is opportunity to do that"
169,"Collectively, I'm just going to use round numbers, we're still only about 10% market share in this whole motion control space"
170,So there is big opportunity to take share
171,But I would -- for us and what we want to demonstrate is that we can grow 150 basis points greater than global industrial production over the cycle
172,It's easier to do that at the beginning of cycle when people are refluxing -- rebounding and refluxing up
173,What we want to demonstrate is over a multi-year period of time
174,"can we average 150 bps, because really top quartile companies and that's also our intention to be demonstrates that over a cycle"
175,"So that's why we're really happy with three quarters in a row, believe me we're quite happy with that"
176,The real trick will be doing it over a longer period of time
177,So Andy it is Tom again
178,"So I've mentioned earlier, so dividends will still be first on the capital deployment side of things, CapEx for organic growth, because organic growth is still the most efficient way to grow the company"
179,We're going to do the share repurchase plan
180,and we're going to pay down debt
181,But you're right at some point as we glide down the debt path we're going to have the ability to start looking at acquisitions as part of our growth strategy as well
182,And I would just -- obviously I can't give line of sight on anything there
183,"-- I will just let everybody know that we continue to work that pipeline, all those relationships"
184,"Those are reviewed as a long standing effort because not something we can turn the switch off, turn it back on"
185,We're going to work those relationships and those strategies
186,These are obviously targets that fit our strategic vision of our respective groups in the corporation
187,So we have --
188,we know what those are and we will continue to work them
189,"As some of you have heard me say before, we want to be great generators of cash and great deployers of cash side and that great deployers of cash side that includes acquisition"
190,"And we will continue to [whatever characterize] have an assertive balance sheet at the appropriate time, and we will work those and we will certainly let you know when we're ready"
191,"Jeff this is Tom, I will just characterize it at a high level"
192,"[indiscernible] the channel opportunities, number one"
193,"our channels are complimentary, so you can have product line being carried on the line curve for the various channel partners"
194,"Those are regional opportunities because North America is really CLARCOR strong, since we are more balanced globally, so these are regional opportunities"
195,"And then there is OEM opportunities, CLARCOR which is we why we love this so much"
196,"is 80% aftermarket business, and we are stronger on the OEM"
197,"So if we're going to leverage those OEM relationships, which may be we have a broader breadth of technologies growing in, as well as filtration that we can leverage"
198,"So those are the three broad areas, channel, region and OEM portfolio that we could go to the OEM with"
199,And we're working those hard
200,Again I would just encourage the analysts to not take numbers into '18 because as we work those if and when they hit they are going to be more in the '19 area
201,"And again I think we will give you a lot more clarity, you can certainly plan on CLARCOR update and the more extensive discussion being a big part of Investor Day in the spring"
202,"Not going to comment on that Jeff, as you know we're working all of them equally"
203,Tim it's Tom
204,So on Asia you're right
205,You have a good memory
206,Over the last 10 years we've made some investments to really -- in advance of Asia growing into those things and really have grown in some
207,But from additional CapEx it will be very selective
208,It will be more a piece of equipment here or two
209,"We don't [lease] any brick and mortar, pretty well add what we need and with the combination of lean and some very targeted equipment purchases, we'll be in good shape"
210,"So Tim, this is Tom again, yes"
211,it is
212,And that's why as Asia grows that's why we get a nice corresponding lift international margins
213,"Just as to refresh -- its Tom again, refresh for people on the phone"
214,So we started as a 114
215,and we're going to approximately 90 for this year
216,And that's something that we constantly look at
217,"It's not something we're [editing] a number, truly what makes sense logically as far as the cost synergies and our growth synergies, people are working in common end markets or common technologies"
218,The pace of consolidation is going to slow
219,"We're not going to continue to grow from 114 to 90, remember if you go from 114 to 90"
220,"that's 24 divisions but that will require 48 divisions to be combined, so that's roughly 45% of the company going through some kind of change process"
221,So we will not continue at that pace
222,And it will be whatever makes sense for our customers and from a cost stand point
223,"So it's going to glide down, by go out a year or so a little bit more"
224,But the simplification actions that will become less of the big driver and more the whole revenue complexity the 80-20 look on being able to be some positive business with
225,Our business strategy is around the 80-20 concept of revenue complexity
226,That was [indiscernible] we're carry simplification to the next level going out the next several years
227,"Steve this is Tom, a reminder for what that is"
228,"We have a return on net assets as incentive plan which really touches almost 95% of our team members around the world and for the senior leadership team, the divisional leadership team we've added a growth element to this"
229,"So if you grow faster in a market, whatever your incentive payout would be, there would be a positive multiplier on top of that"
230,If you grow less in a market there will be a negative hair cut to your payout
231,So we've rolled that out a couple of years ago
232,"And unfortunately the timing was not appropriate because there was a negative hair cut for people, and this was really the first time in the history of the company we did that"
233,But as you might imagine that drove a lot of attention and drove the right kind of behaviors
234,"So what it does is it encourages people to what we set on the Win Strategy, want you to grow faster on the market and if you do that you're going to be rewarded handsomely for that"
235,And so that's
236,"I think the incentive plan, any good incentive plan you want to drive behavior and the indicators are striving with the right kind of behavior"
237,Yes
