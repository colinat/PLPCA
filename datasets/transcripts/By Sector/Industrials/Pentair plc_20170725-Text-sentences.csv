0,Thanks Jim
1,Weâ€™re pleased that our second quarter performance came in slightly out of our expectations
2,"Sales were in line with guidance, while segment income and adjusted EPS slightly exceeded the high end of our range"
3,We completed the sale of our Valves & Controls business during the second quarter and with the proceeds had significantly improved our balance sheet
4,Later in the call John will discuss the balance sheet in more detail and the impact of the Valves & Controls sales closing somewhat later than our initial timeline
5,"Weâ€™ve tightened our full year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.50 per share, which is the midpoint of our prior guidance"
6,We experienced higher than planned interest expense in the first half due to the delay in the Valves & Controls close
7,And weâ€™ve also seen our share count increase modestly
8,Offsetting these two headwinds was our better first half operating performance
9,Performance that we believe is carrying momentum into the second half of the year
10,"Also factored into our tightened guidance is the fact that we will incur some incremental redundant corporate costs in the second half, as we prepared to spin-off our Electrical business next year"
11,"With an improving top line, continued margin expansion and a stronger balance sheet, we believe the prospects are bright for both our Water and Electrical businesses exiting 2017."
12,Now letâ€™s turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our second quarter 2017 results
13,"As mentioned, the second quarter performance was in line with our top line expectations and a little better from an income and adjusted EPS standpoint"
14,"Adjusted core sales declined 1% in the quarter, but weâ€™re up 1% for the first half"
15,"This is important to mention, because the pool season heated up in March this year as opposed to April a year ago, resulting in a tough comparison in the second quarter"
16,Segment income grew 6% and operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points with both segments delivering margin expansion greater than 100 basis points and corporate expense coming in a little more favorable than weâ€™d anticipated
17,"Weâ€™re pleased with our strong margin expansion, which we were able to deliver despite worse material inflation and price recovery than planned"
18,"Adjusted EPS grew 14% to $1, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.01 despite incurring a slightly higher interest expense and share count during the quarter"
19,Free cash flow of $289 million during the quarter was in line with normal seasonality following the cash usage reported in the first quarter
20,Now letâ€™s turn to Slide 6 for a look at Water performance in Q2.
21,Our Water segment delivered an adjusted core sales decline of 1%
22,Segment income grew 5% and return on sales expanded a very healthy 120 basis points
23,"Our Filtration & Process business saw a core sales decline 3%, and strength in our residential and food service businesses were offset by ongoing softness in global diesel and muted spending in the beer industry"
24,Food service was the bright spot in the quarter growing high single digits on strength in the convenience and grocery store channels
25,Floor technology saw a core sales declined 4% as we continue to proven lower margin product lines and focus on driving margin and cash flow improvement
26,"We saw our Residential and Irrigation business grow in the quarter, but this was not enough to offset continued weakness in our engineered pump businesses serving industrial and infrastructure"
27,We saw orders improved for those large pumps for the second consecutive quarter indicating that weâ€™ve reached the bottom in this business
28,But weâ€™re not expecting the top line to benefit from those improved orders until 2018.
29,"Finally, our Precision Spray business which largely serves agriculture bodes another quarter of healthy growth"
30,"Following a very strong first quarter Aquatic & Environmental Systems saw a core sales grow 1%, which yielded our first half core sales growth of 7%, in line with the growth rate seen in the past several years in the business and what we expect to continue"
31,"As a reminder, the pool business can be impacted by timing of the season, which is what we believe happened this year between the first and second quarter"
32,We continue to look for Aquatic & Environmental Systems to deliver another strong year of growth in 2017.
33,"Now letâ€™s move to Slide 7, for a look at Electrical performance in Q2."
34,Adjusted core sales grew 1% in Electrical as the strength we saw in the first quarter carried over into the second quarter
35,Segment income grew 1% and return on sales expanded a robust 140 basis points due to improved mix and ramping productivity
36,Within Electrical Enclosures declined 1% and remained a tale of two verticals
37,Our Industrial business grew mid single digits for the second consecutive quarter and we believe this represents momentum that will carry over into the second half
38,"Offsetting this strength with continued softness at our smaller telecom business, which continue to match the strength within the Industrial business"
39,"Core sales in Thermal declined to 12%, as a reminder our Thermal business is facing a nearly $100 million top line headwind in 2017 as three large jobs from 2016 were completed"
40,"Excluding these large jobs, which weâ€™ve called out before, we saw Thermal grow on both the projects and product side of the business"
41,The focus continues to be on aligning the business to a smaller order size world and the underlying improvement in the second quarter gives us increased confidence that the business should exit 2017 in a strong position
42,Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business saw a core sales decline following 7% growth in the first quarter
43,The Commercial business remained strong with the quarterly volatility stemming from the smaller infrastructure related business
44,"As we mentioned last quarter, this piece of Electrical has faced a fair amount of material inflation to start the year and weâ€™ve continued to take select price actions to help mitigate some of those higher inflation"
45,We expect the Commercial business to continue to grow in the back half and weâ€™ll look at areas to help reduce the quarterly infrastructure volatility experienced in the past few quarters
46,"Please turn to Slide 8, for an update on our planned separation"
47,"Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to provide an update on the separation now what weâ€™ve made in May"
48,"As a reminder our Board has approved a plan to spin-off our Electrical business, which we expect to be completed in the second quarter of 2018."
49,Weâ€™ve organized a dedicated project management office that is currently driving some 20 different work streams
50,Weâ€™ve made the decision on the organizational structure of the direct reports to the future CEOâ€™s of both companies and the next level work is underway
51,We expect to have an initial Form-10 filing during the fourth quarter
52,"Finally, we should have further updates on the capital structure of both companies by early 2018."
53,Our second quarter performance was another step towards regularly delivering our forecast of the business
54,"The second quarter performance also highlights, why we believe the long-term prospects of both businesses are attractive"
55,"Weâ€™re excited for Pentairâ€™s next chapters; we create two industry leading pure play companies, one in Water and one in Electrical"
56,We strongly believe that both companies are well positioned for long-term growth and value creation with the scale and strength to control their own destinies
57,The increased focus of both companies should help to raise the execution even further and drive higher differentiated growth
58,Both companies can become appreciated for the jewels that they are
59,Iâ€™ll now turn the call over to John
60,"Iâ€™m just overall, Steve, I mean for both Water and Electrical"
61,", Iâ€™d say that weâ€™re looking at somewhere between $15 million and $20 million headwind for the full year"
62,"Some of that realized in Q1 and Q2 and then Q3 and Q4 related to little less benefit from pricing, and a little stronger impact from inflation on the sources side, both of them together"
63,"Yes, Jeff"
64,"I mean, I think we started the year anticipating the fact that as inflation rises both of our businesses Water and Electrical have historically been able to take advantage of those situations and raise price in the industry and have that price accepted and therefore mitigate most all of the material inflation"
65,"I think we were concerned about one issue this year, which was weâ€™ve never had that experience with a stronger U.S"
66,And weâ€™re seeing the fact that most of the channels that we participate are fighting on price and therefore asking us to absorb and become more productive in serving them
67,And thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s playing out
68,The good news is thereâ€™s a lot more growth
69,and I think weâ€™re all experienced in that growth and weâ€™re able to offset that impact
70,"But itâ€™s generally across the board, Jeff"
71,"Yes, Jeff we havenâ€™t â€“ weâ€™re thinking about that"
72,But weâ€™re not in a position to share that yet
73,"Weâ€™re running different scenarios and planning for what the capital structure to be at both companies, but we donâ€™t have any information yet"
74,"Hey, Deane"
75,"When you look at, we had such a strong quarter last year and the season started late, it didnâ€™t start until mid-April"
76,And this year it started early
77,So we had a great March
78,And that really explains all the difference
79,"When we look at the sell-through in the channel and we look at the activity in the end market, we think that business is every bit as strong as it has been, hence my comments about it"
80,The 7% growth in the first half is more representative of the kind of growth we expect in the industry
81,So itâ€™s really just timing
82,"Theyâ€™ll be introduced this season, but they wonâ€™t move the needle this season"
83,We continue to be the innovator in the industry
84,So weâ€™re not going to give up that mantle
85,"Itâ€™s really rail related, I mean, if you take a look at commercial and what I would call more traditional industrial is just fine"
86,"But the infrastructure, there was an anticipation that we would be spending on roads and bridges"
87,"Now here in Minnesota, looks like you what we are, but broadly in the rest of the country, it doesnâ€™t picked-up as much"
88,And then rail spending is off
89,"And thatâ€™s for our EFS business, thatâ€™s the biggest part of the infrastructure"
90,Hey Scott
91,"Hey, good morning"
92,"Weâ€™re seeing normal seasonality, we see that because particularly Water is so seasonal"
93,The cash flows are following the normal pattern with a negative cash flow in the first quarter a big pickup in the second quarter and then continue to building in the third and fourth
94,I wouldnâ€™t
95,expect the pattern to be any different
96,"Thereâ€™s a little bit of mix issue, I mean, it is not the strongest pool quarter"
97,Our Aquaticâ€™s businesses got a pretty good margin
98,So thatâ€™s the only mix issue and the rest is just Q2 performance carryover to Q3.
99,"Hey, John"
100,Where is the 23 come in front of you?
101,"Okay, letâ€™s go"
102,"So, I mean, it really is just one item"
103,And itâ€™s the fact that we are now projecting for the rest of the year what we believe the realized price and the realized material inflation will be
104,and that is the only difference between the two forecasts
105,Youâ€™re talking about for the â€“ in Electrical?
106,"Hello, Mr. Pokrzywinski"
107,"Yes, both commercial and industrial"
108,"Particularly as winter cools-off I guess, winter heats up is rather its better term"
109,Thatâ€™s really Thermalâ€™s biggest season
110,And the nice thing is the smaller projects and the products MRO itâ€™s a better mix of business
111,"So, Iâ€™m pretty please right now with the progress weâ€™re making in Thermal"
112,"So each side, Water seasonal business is obviously the pool"
113,And on the Electrical side the business that really experiences the seasonality of Thermal
114,And then everything else is steady state throughout the year
115,"So Josh, if you want us to square away â€“ are you an old Navy guy?"
116,"Square away, itâ€™s pretty good"
117,"Anyhow, so as we set up the â€“ weâ€™re really standing up to companies, we have an open CFO job, we have two open CHRO jobs, we want to get these jobs hired, we want to get â€"
118,“
119,so thereâ€™s going to be some overlapping as people come and go
120,But those all go to the P&L
121,And those are just a couple of examples
122,"But as John said, our objective is to minimize any leakage if you will at the corporate cost level in another words we minimize any additions once weâ€™re on a separate run rate in the two companies"
123,Good morning
124,"Yes, we expect a better second half for sure"
125,"Actually on the telecom side, we had some big projects there, that are just they havenâ€™t reloaded yet and weâ€™"
126,re hopefully it will
127,But they havenâ€™t
128,So thatâ€™s why it was negative in the second quarter
129,I think in the third and fourth quarter that will be â€“ that it will still be a drag
130,But it wonâ€™t be as bad
131,"And Industrial, despite the more challenging price environment, the volume is good"
132,And thatâ€™s a really profitable business for us on the Industrial side
133,"But many of you know is our Hoffman brand, so, thatâ€™s"
134,"the big driver, Hoffman doing better"
135,So weâ€™ll have â€
136,“ we expect to have low single digit core growth in Q3.
137,"No, we think that the pricing dynamic in Q2 continues to move forward into Q3 and Q4."
138,Itâ€™s really â€
139,"“ whatâ€™s happened in capital spending, across those, itâ€™s normalized, right"
140,"In oil and gas, there was a huge decline and basically it was a rough justice"
141,"They cut everything and now they are on capital level, so they returned finally to normal"
142,"So itâ€™s actually oil and gas and industrial, itâ€™s chemicals, itâ€™s really across the board"
143,"Now CapEx is better in petrochemical, the petrochemical side and in some of the other industrial side"
144,So we talk about Hoffman being up in industrial â€
145,“ general industrial
146,No
147,"and it really hasnâ€™t been our focus,"
148,"as I mentioned, we do really well, when large projects happen"
149,"And so weâ€™re not focused on those, and weâ€™ll do well when they come back"
150,"Our focus is making sure, we are getting more than our lion share in the smaller projects and Iâ€™m really pleased with the progress that weâ€™re making on that"
151,And thatâ€™s really around the world
152,"Well, I mean it was a reduction in force and redeployment areas, where business from where there isnâ€™t?"
153,"Right now, weâ€™ve got some really great work, defining the strategies in each of water and electrical"
154,"And when that whole strategy work is done, we will tell you exactly, what we think the growth rates, that we believe weâ€™ll achieve these two separate companies will be"
155,"But Iâ€™m not going to pre-suppose that, Iâ€™ll let John"
156,Weâ€™re looking forward to talking about
157,"Good morning, Nathan"
158,Itâ€™s a slight use
159,"Thatâ€™s rounding Rob, it was a little higher in the first half, as we talked about, but itâ€™s rounding"
160,"Thanks, Hope"
161,"2017 has been another eventful year for Pentair, as weâ€™ve successfully divested our Valves & Controls business"
162,"Significantly strengthen our balance sheet, with those proceeds"
163,Delivered our first half commitments and announce that weâ€™re separating our Water and Electrical businesses into two standalone companies
164,"We remain confident in our ability to drive double digit adjusted EPS growth for the year, as our focus remains on delivering the second half of 2017, against our commitments while standing up, two public companies"
165,Thank you for your continued interest in Pentair and weâ€™ll talk to you soon
