0,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2017"
1,Earnings Conference Call
2,"On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results"
3,"Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions"
4,Quanta's first quarter results were consistent with our expectations and put us on track to achieve our full year outlook
5,Our end markets are strengthening and we continue to believe we are entering a renewed multiyear up-cycle for our business
6,"The successful execution of our strategic imperatives, coupled with favorable end-market trends, positions us well to further separate Quanta in the marketplace and for profitable growth"
7,Fundamental to Quanta's growth is our view that our backlog will remain strong and has a potential for solid growth
8,Our electric power segment backlog increased without the inclusion of multiple larger project opportunities that are in various stages of regulatory review or that remain subject to competitive submission processes to meet state and provincial energy policies
9,"Oil and gas segment backlog declined in the quarter, primarily due to burn associated with significant pipeline construction activity, seasonality and the cancellation of a pipeline project contract for which we received a cancellation fee"
10,"As a reminder, oil and gas segment backlog can be variable due to its faster book-and-burn nature and the timing of larger pipeline project awards"
11,"As we mentioned in our Investor Day a month ago, we feel incrementally better about opportunities to book pipeline work for the second half of this year, which should positively impact backlog as contracts are executed"
12,We're in the late-stage negotiations on multiple larger pipeline projects that are expected to start construction in 2017 and are in discussions for billions of dollars of larger pipeline projects that could break ground over the next several years
13,"Overall, we are supporting our customers' project scoping and infrastructure development initiatives across our segments and believe there is opportunity for our backlog to increase to record levels over the next several quarters"
14,"Turning to the electric power segment, Labrador Island Link transmission project for Nalcor Energy in Canada is progressing well"
15,"In addition, full scale construction on the Fort McMurray West 500 kilovolt transmission project is on track to begin in the third quarter of this year"
16,We have completed many important engineering and procurement milestones over the past two years for this EPC project and now look forward to the construction phase
17,The Fort McMurray West project is the largest individual project ever awarded to Quanta
18,"Based on this expected timing, the Fort McMurray project should ramp up as the Nalcor project moves to completion"
19,"This dynamic should provide an efficient transition of our people and equipment, improve the stability for our Canadian operations and provide multiyear visibility since the project is scheduled to complete in 2019."
20,"Though our Canadian operations remain challenged by economic conditions, we are proud of how our team has executed on the Nalcor project"
21,"Overall, our customers' multiyear capital budgets continue to increase and should remain robust for some time"
22,We continue to believe larger transmission project awards will likely increase over the next 18 months
23,We are in various levels of active discussion with numerous utilities and merchant transmission companies in North America about their transmission projects
24,"Several of these projects are making progress with permitting and regulatory approvals, which increases our confidence that they could break ground over the near to medium term"
25,"In addition, small and medium transmission projects, as well as distribution work, remain active, and large multiyear MSA proposal activity is at record levels"
26,"Further, we believe the deployment of several new large multiyear capital programs by our customers is imminent"
27,These programs include both larger and smaller electric power infrastructure projects to upgrade and enhance the grid
28,We are able to provide comprehensive turnkey solutions for these multiyear capital programs that we believe are unmatched in the industry
29,"As we have said in the past, we believe we are uniquely well positioned to provide solutions for these potential opportunities, which are of the size and scope our industry has rarely experienced"
30,We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment and believe we are entering an upward multiyear cycle
31,The end-market drivers we have spoken about for some time continues to spur demand for Electric Power Infrastructure Services
32,"These drivers, including the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas, grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability are what we believe will continue to provide opportunities to grow are our electric business"
33,"Turning to our oil and gas segment, we generated record revenues in the quarter, which is also noteworthy because it occurred when it's typically the lowest quarter of the year due to seasonality"
34,"The quarter's record revenues were primarily driven by strong activity on several larger pipeline projects in the Southern United States and in Canada, which contribute to significant margin improvements versus the same quarter last year"
35,"We did, however, experienced some margin pressure in our base business"
36,"For example, we have been increasing and training our workforce to meet our customers' needs for the multiyear gas distribution and integrity programs"
37,"However, a couple of these customers delayed commencement of work under our MSAs during the quarter, which impacted margins"
38,"As discussed earlier in my remarks, we believe the larger pipeline project market will remain active for several years and are pleased with our execution to date"
39,"In addition to larger projects, we see opportunity for base load work to continue to grow over the coming years"
40,"This base load work includes supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services, natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, MSAs, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering"
41,"During the first quarter, we resolved the litigation initiated by Dycom Industries related to the non-compete agreement entered into in connection with Quanta's disposition of certain communication construction operations to Dycom in December of 2012."
42,"While the terms of the resolution are confidential, we are very pleased with the outcome"
43,We began the expansion of our U.S
44,"communications infrastructure services operations following the expiration of our prior non-compete agreement in early December 2016, and with this litigation now behind us, our ability to continue our U.S"
45,expansion efforts is unencumbered
46,"market expansion efforts have been very well received by our current and potential customers, and we are actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S"
47,telecom and cable MSOs
48,We have developed a workforce and delivery model over the past several months and anticipate receiving awards in the second quarter
49,Outside of the U.S
50,", we signed several MSAs in Canada"
51,"During the first quarter, deployed fiber to eight communities throughout the country, and our Latin American operation continues to expand its fiber, wireless and cable operations, which are all performing well"
52,Quanta has provided infrastructure services to the communications industry since the company's inception and the expansion of our U.S
53,operations complements our existing and growing operations in Canada and Latin America
54,"All three of these geographies provide multifaceted opportunities for growth in a broad diversified customer base, which we believe is advantageous versus focusing on just one area"
55,We're excited about the market opportunity and look forward to sharing our progress and success as we grow our communications infrastructure services operations
56,"We also continue to advance our infrastructure solutions capabilities with strategic partnerships between Quanta, our customers and capital partners"
57,"These typically take the form of concessions, public-private partnerships or private infrastructure projects in the markets served by Quanta"
58,These structures are fairly common arrangements in the infrastructure world and Quanta has good success with partnerships like these over the recent years
59,"Quanta believes aligning is a true partner in these projects, and for select projects investing alongside our customers, creates a strong collaborative relationship that is open and transparent"
60,We believe this approach yields greater opportunity for Quanta and our customers to drive a more efficient and effective design and overall structure that reduces cost and increases the chances the project moves forward and is executed successfully
61,Infrastructure solutions is a capability that we've been building and executing on for a number of years
62,"These successful efforts have resulted in approximately $2 billion of project revenue across our core competencies in electric power, oil and gas and telecom and across our geographies in Canada, the U.S"
63,and Latin America
64,"Further, we are pursuing a number of additional projects that fit well with our infrastructure solutions capabilities"
65,"During the quarter, we enhanced our capabilities with the establishment of First Infrastructure Capital, or FIC, which is a partnership between Quanta and select infrastructure investors"
66,FIC provided $750 million of available capital to invest in infrastructure projects with the potential for this additional capital from our existing FIC partners
67,"This partnership is an important part of our broader strategy of partnering with our customers and providing fully integrated, differentiated infrastructure solutions while leveraging Quanta's operational excellence, strong execution capabilities and project finance expertise"
68,"In summary, the year started off well and we are on target to achieve our full expectations"
69,"While project permitting and regulatory challenges remain, we continue to have a positive multiyear view of the end markets we serve and believe we are entering a new - renewed multiyear up-cycle for our electric power, oil and gas and communications infrastructure service capabilities"
70,We are confident that Quanta is well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers and capitalize on favorable end-market trends
71,We are focused on operating the business for the long term and continuing to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership
72,We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers
73,We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our stakeholders
74,"With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results"
75,"As far as the backlog goes, and where we're at in the pipeline cycle there, it's lumpy, we've talked about it"
76,We've announced ACP before
77,It's not in our backlog today
78,So you can see some of the stuff that's not in there and others that are imminent here
79,So it's -
80,we're just in late stages of negotiations
81,It doesn't meet the criteria to put in our backlog
82,We feel confident that we'll fill that up with our large pipeline business
83,The 2018 cycle is robust
84,The latter half of 2017 is looking favorable
85,So we're happy with where we're at on that
86,"As far as the cancellation fee, there are some contracts that contemplate this and delays"
87,and this is one of them
88,"Roughly, the amount was around $100 million so for 2017."
89,We're in a robust environment in our large pipeline business
90,Rover's moving along
91,I think we're in good shape in 2018 as well as we stated in the past that we do have capacity
92,We can still book work
93,"But I feel confident that with the ongoing opportunities and what we see, we should be in pretty good shape here for the next few years"
94,Good morning
95,"Yes, I think you have to look at it on the electric side and the gas side and split it"
96,"If you want to talk about Canada, the overall economics, being energy based, are down but our project-based business and the need to move natural gas to the coastline is there"
97,We like where we're at
98,We like where we're positioned there
99,"We're starting to see some projects move forward in your shales, in your Montney shales and such moving that gas out"
100,"And when you get some takeaway in there, things will look good"
101,We've seen Trans Mountain get mentioned a few times
102,"Those kind of things, those larger projects stroll up resources in the country and so that allows others - other projects that we'll be on to - we can execute well"
103,So I like where we're at there
104,"I think we're cautious about the overall economy on the gas side, but there's signs of life"
105,"On the electric side, with us having a backbone project of WFMAC and coming off Nalcor, we are seeing some stuff in the East, Toronto and in the West"
106,"Alberta is still, besides WFMAC, it's still very depressed there"
107,So we're optimistic on the coast and we're cautious about the Alberta market
108,"But all in all, we're executing through it pretty well through a tough economy there"
109,"And if you go back a few years in Canada, it was our highest margins in our company"
110,So I'm optimistic we'll come back to those margins over time
111,Good morning
112,"Yes, as I've said with Noelle, I think what we see and our opportunity that we see and where we're at in the stages of the contract negotiations, we feel confident in the statement"
113,So I'm fairly optimistic that we'll be in record backlogs
114,"I would say, Tahira, we'll over-communicate a bit for a few quarters here on telecom because we'll give you some idea of where we're at"
115,I do think we're a little bit behind where I'd like to be
116,"When you have a lawsuit in front of you, it does"
117,It is a distraction on the operation and that past us now
118,"And hopefully, that's the last time we'll talk about that"
119,", I think it is"
120,And we're optimistic of the markets and you see it growing
121,"You see what AT&T, Verizon and others are doing in that business"
122,"And our Canadian operations, our Latin America operations are growing nicely, similar to what you see others are doing in the U.S"
123,So we had really good feedback from the customer base
124,and I'm confident we'll move forward here in the next few quarters
125,And we'll definitely communicate it to the investment community
126,"Yes, I'll talk a little bit about the job itself and let Derrick talk a little bit about the numbers"
127,"From our standpoint, we're working collaboratively with the client"
128,and I think both of us have the same goal in mind and that's for a completion
129,and it be a successful project
130,There's nothing to read into that other than we're working together to - on both commercially and on schedule that they would like to see completed this year
131,So we're working through all the issues that it takes to do that
132,"It is a 1,200 kilometer or so job across very remote country"
133,and you get 50 foot of snow in the winter and so things
134,", you get a thaw"
135,And so it's difficult from a construction standpoint and we've done a great job executing through it
136,I'm happy with our performance there
137,And so the client's happy with us
138,and we'll get through the commercial issues here over the next few quarters
139,And I'll let Derrick comment on where we're at from a cash standpoint
140,Yes
141,"Last year, we added some nonunion capabilities in addition to what we've had"
142,All those projects were around the edges on all of them
143,And so we see them depending on where we're at from capacity and what they're trying to accomplish
144,We're in there
145,We're in all the basins for the most part
146,There's also some EPC opportunities with both pipe and stations in that arena that will be around
147,So we like it
148,We like it
149,It gets capacity out of the market as well
150,"So again, as you start to see that takeaway come in, you'll start to see midstream business come back and all those markets are good markets for us"
151,Yes
152,"Jamie, I'd like to add a little bit of commentary on that"
153,"We got $6 billion or so to execute through the next three quarters, and obviously, the first quarter has got the most seasonality in it"
154,"We're through it, so we can see the visibility in the next three"
155,"As we execute through, we will update"
156,"Also, as Derrick said, we added roughly around 1,000 employees in the quarter"
157,"And as you do that it in your baseload business for the future, it's difficult to put the thing into three month windows"
158,"So as we have to talk about today, that's a good thing going forward"
159,"We're, by our highest headcount, 29,400."
160,So we're optimistic about what's going on with the base business and also where we're going in the future
161,So it did put a little pressure on this three months here
162,"Yes, I don't - I'll let Derrick give you a quantification"
163,I just - it's a general quantification to us
164,"It's just we know it's pressure when we see 1,000 employees get at it"
165,But we contemplate a lot of that in our guidance and so for us to say we didn't contemplate any of that would be a fallacy because we knew seasonality was there
166,"We've stated it when we talked in our Investor Day that we thought that there would be some seasonality, we contemplated it"
167,"Yes, there were some impacts, both sides of this"
168,"But again, we contemplate the seasonality in the first quarter"
169,"But adding 1,000 employees and the seasonality is kind of what we're talking about"
170,Yes
171,"From a revenue perspective, yes, at the high end, I would tell you at this stage, I mean, it's possible that - for both segments to slightly exceed 10% to get to the high end of the range"
172,"And then from a timing perspective and how that plays out, I think that we've still yet to see the risk profile as the back half of the year may still yet not materialize for oil and gas, which is what's giving the variability in the overall revenue profile with the back half still having the risk of having declines"
173,"Although we feel incrementally confident in the nature of the rewards, as it stands here, I mean, until we actually receive and place them in backlog"
174,We're not in position to guide to anything stronger and to continue to caution that the back half of the year could have weakness such as the fourth quarter
175,"Much like we said at year-end, it could be down"
176,"And then the last part of your question, telecom, yes, as it stands here right now, we've not baked in any incremental aspects of telecom"
177,"We're still looking at something in the $150 million to $200 million range from both Canada, the U.S"
178,and Latin America contributions
179,We have not increased anything relative to telecom
180,"No, I mean, I don't want to put a time frame on it"
181,We're going to collaborate with our customers to get the right contracts in place for both risks and M&As
182,It takes time
183,"They're big projects, obviously"
184,"So as you walk through those, it just takes time"
185,So I don't want to put a time frame on it
186,but I would say the next few quarters here
187,We're not complete with all of them
188,Many of them are in the late stages and we're happy with what we've done as far as executing on the broad spectrum of all of our pipe and our spreads
189,We're extremely satisfied with where we're at
190,We can always do better but we're happy
191,"I think what puts pressure on our segment is that you have a lot of ancillary businesses with your MSA work, your integrity work, which is good and its good long-term work, but you do get seasonality"
192,"And when you are ramping for these long-term integrity programs, along with that seasonality puts pressure in any given quarter when you add those folks"
193,So lots of your adds are developed in this quarter or to support that piece of business and those guys once you get them trained
194,"And also, we had some customers that delayed or were working through some state regulatory issues that cause some delays in MSAs that were anticipated to go in the first quarter"
195,So that also caused a little pressure in the segment
196,We'll work through that as we go and start executing on their budgets for the year
197,"Again, it's the right answer for the long term of the business, it just puts a little pressure here in the quarter"
198,But we're happy with the way we executed on our mainline work
199,"Well, we're not done with them yet, but we're happy with where we're at"
200,"From our standpoint, the way we looked at 2017 is playing out largely like we thought it would"
201,"As far as the way our customers look at it, they may look at it a little bit different than we did"
202,"But from our standpoint, the way that we see things happening is basically like we thought it would"
203,What's going in '17 is going and with a few exceptions
204,"Some of them did push a bit, but for the most part, it's playing out like we thought it would"
205,We do need to get some commissioners in place
206,I don't think it's an issue
207,The administration has committed to putting people to work
208,I think you'll see that
209,The biggest issue that we see is probably in the Northeast with some of the water permits and some of the things that are going on there that you've seen make the press
210,"All in all, it's lining up like"
211,we thought it would
212,"I mean, I'll make a general comment on it"
213,"We've talked about the integrity business in our LDC,"
214,"our local distribution markets, and the sustainability of that over the - there's 20 to 30 year bills as you get low natural gas prices, low interest and"
215,they're able to lock in long-term bills
216,I think it's good for the ratepayer
217,It's good for our customers
218,"So as you see that, you'll start to see them announce it in their capital budgets"
219,"and we're executing on those CapEx projects across multi-years, 20 or so years"
220,We like the market
221,We think we can grow it double digits
222,"And then that piece of business, it's a long-term stable type work"
223,It does have lower margins than your larger diameter pipeline work
224,"And it does have more cyclicality as you go into the winter months, just the way it is"
225,"So it's just, in general, lower margins, more seasonality, but its good business and a good long-term business"
226,and we understand the risk on it
227,"Yes, Alex, some your spreads will come down as well in the quarter"
228,"So the net effect of that, as the spreads start to come off a bit in the quarter, it's just a dynamic"
229,Yes
230,I just - I really don't want to get into it
231,"I just - from my standpoint, we're in late stages negotiations on multiple large projects and I think it's -"
232,we'll talk about it more as we get them signed up
233,"We talked about ACP so others have announced that, announced what's in their backlog, so you can see the type of contracts we're talking about with Atlantic Coast there"
234,"Again, we watch that"
235,Everything concerns me
236,and so we stay on it
237,", we stay and watch it and think about it and think about how it impacts our business and our customers"
238,"And so yes, we're watching it closely"
239,Most of our projects are natural gas based at this point
240,And we're moving gas and that's baseload fuel at this
241,"- what we see going forward, it will continue to be baseload"
242,"If you look at it, it surpassed coal and your electric grid"
243,You need redundancy
244,"We like that business, LNG export"
245,I think that piece of business is really good
246,"Oil, we're watching it closely"
247,It affects Canada more so than the Lower 48 as far as what we're doing on a daily basis
248,And it also affects the overall economy in certain areas
249,So we keep our eye on it
250,"So far, we've kind of weathered through some of the lower pricing and the volatility in it"
251,"Our customers continue to spend CapEx on different things and with the low interest environment and low natural gas, so it allows us to get a multiyear view on many things in our business"
252,Yes
253,I think it's just -
254,"if you go to the major IOUs and specialty or integrated IOUs, nat gas and electric, if you just look at their CapEx and their OpEx budgets, they're giving five year guidance for the most part"
255,As you look at that
256,"and you look at the incremental impact and how much more that is due to all the things that we talked about with grid modernization, it allows us to get more visible and work with them on multiyear builds as they get regulatory - they're getting their regulatory relief there"
257,and I'm able to talk to them about a long-term agreement in the rate base
258,So I think it's good for the customer
259,Fuel's going down
260,They can invest in infrastructure and talk about a multiyear view
261,"And this is unique over the last year, so you're starting to see this"
262,And it's additive to what was already going on in the industry
263,So we like what we'd see
264,It gives us an ability to provide the solution that we think we're unique on and talk about multiyear programs and how we help with those
265,So we like that piece of business and think it's something that's additive to what's been going on in the past
266,The overall environment in the communications business is robust
267,They need people to build infrastructure
268,"So as you see that, you can see I'm talking about it as well in our CapEx"
269,You can see others talking about how they're putting on people
270,It's a big market
271,I'm optimistic we'll be able to sign stuff fairly quickly here
272,I'd like to thank you all for participating in our first quarter 2017 conference call
273,We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest on Quanta Services
274,"Thank you, and this concludes our call"
