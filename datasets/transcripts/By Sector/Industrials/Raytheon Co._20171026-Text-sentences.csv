0,"Thanks, Tom"
1,"I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights"
2,And then we'll move on to questions
3,"During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning"
4,If everyone would please turn to page 3.
5,"We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations"
6,"We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11."
7,"Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% with growth across all of our businesses"
8,"Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.97, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes"
9,We generated solid operating cash flow of $382 million in the third quarter
10,"Operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter, as expected, primarily due to higher required pension contributions in the third quarter 2017."
11,This was partially offset by the timing of collections
12,"During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.4 million shares for $700 million"
13,"I also want to point out, based on our strong performance to date, that we're raising our full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS that we provided in July"
14,"We are also updating the expected sales growth range from 4% to 6% to 5% to 6%, as well as making other updates"
15,I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes
16,"Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results"
17,Company bookings continue to be strong
18,"For the third quarter, bookings were $7 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, were $19.2 billion"
19,"It's worth noting that on a trailing four-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08."
20,"Total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $36.7 billion, an increase of approximately $950 million compared to the end of the third quarter 2016."
21,"If you'd now move to page 5, third quarter 2017 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July"
22,Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales
23,Looking now at sales by business
24,"IDS had third quarter 2017 net sales of $1.4 billion, up 4% compared with the same quarter last year"
25,The increase in net sales for the quarter was driven primarily by higher net sales on an International Early Warning Radar Program
26,Missile Systems had third quarter 2017 net sales of $1.9 billion
27,The 10% increase from the third quarter 2016 was primarily due to the Paveway and Excalibur programs
28,"And at IIS, SAS and Forcepoint, sales were up slightly compared with the same period last year"
29,Moving ahead to page 6.
30,"Overall, the company continues to perform well"
31,Our operating margin was 13.7% for the total company and 13% on a business segment basis
32,So looking now at the business margins
33,"IDS third quarter 2017 operating margin was strong at 16.6%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year"
34,The increase was driven by improved program performance
35,"The decrease in operating margin at IIS in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, as expected, was primarily driven by a change in program mix and other performance"
36,"Missiles margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies"
37,"This increase was driven by favorable adjustments on a couple of international contracts due to a change in requirements, partially offset by an unfavorable contract modification"
38,SAS operating margin was in line with last year's third quarter
39,"And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2017 operating margin, as expected, was lower than last year's comparable quarter primarily due to investments to expand the sales force capacity, increase the new business pipeline and improve brand awareness"
40,"Additionally, I want to point out that our third quarter operating income was unfavorably impacted by $26 million for the annual actuarial update to our pension plans"
41,I'll touch on this more in a minute
42,Turning now to page 7.
43,Third quarter 2017
44,"EPS was $1.97, better than expected, primarily driven by strong margin performance as we accelerated some program efficiencies that were previously expected later in the year"
45,"On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2017 to reflect our improved operating performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter"
46,"We have increased the low end of our full year 2017 net sales by $200 million and we now expect net sales to be between $25.3 billion and $25.6 billion, up 5% to 6% from 2016."
47,The increase over 2016 is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business
48,"As I just mentioned, and as we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans"
49,"As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year decreased by $39 million from $428 million to $389 million or an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.09 per share"
50,"Again, $26 million or $0.06 per share was recorded in the third quarter 2017 and $13 million or $0.03 per share is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter 2017."
51,Turning to share count
52,"We continue to see our average diluted shares outstanding at approximately 292 million shares for 2017, a 2% year-over-year reduction, consistent with what we said in July"
53,We are reducing the range of our net interest expense to be between $185 million and $190 million to reflect higher average cash balances and interest rates on cash
54,This is worth about $0.02 to EPS compared to our prior guidance
55,We have slightly lowered our effective tax rate to reflect an update to the assumed tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and for some additional tax planning items within the second half of the year
56,The total benefit is worth about $0.05 per share for the full year
57,We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year
58,"We've increased our full year 2017 EPS, raising the low end by $0.10 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance, after absorbing the $0.09 per share unfavorable pension impact I just discussed"
59,We now expect our EPS to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.55.
60,The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to-date as well as the improvement to the effective tax rate and lower net interest expense
61,Our operating cash flow in the third quarter was in line with our prior expectations
62,We continue to see our 2017 operating cash flow outlook between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion
63,"Similar to last year, and as I mentioned on the last earnings call, our cash flow profile is more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of program milestones and collections on some of our larger contracts"
64,"And as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business"
65,"We've increased the low end of the guidance range for the full year sales outlook at IDS, IIS, Missiles and SAS to reflect a combination of stronger bookings performance to-date and fourth quarter expectations"
66,"Looking at margins, at the business segment level compared to our prior guidance, we have raised the low end of the range by 10 basis points and now see business segment operating margin in a range of 12.5% to 12.6% for the full year"
67,"And at the company level, as a result of the actuarial update to the pension plans that I previously discussed, we have narrowed the margin range from our prior guidance and now see our company operating margin to be in a range of 13.2% to 13.3% for the full year"
68,Before moving on to page 10.
69,"As Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2017 bookings outlook to a range of between $26.5 billion to $27.5 billion"
70,This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2018.
71,We expect international to be about a third of total bookings this year
72,"On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations"
73,We expect our fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $6.7 billion to $7 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.96.
74,We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion
75,"Now turning to next year, as we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January"
76,"As we sit here today, we currently see the book-to-bill ratio in 2018 above 1 and strong sales growth for 2018 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2017 outlook"
77,"We expect business segment margin to be up slightly in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by improved program mix"
78,We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 31% in 2018.
79,I would note that this tax rate guidance reflects current law
80,"In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2018, in line with 2017 as improvement from the businesses is offset by higher cash taxes, and as expected, higher required pension contributions"
81,"Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on a defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown"
82,"So, if you could please move to page 11."
83,We have provided a combined FAS/CAS adjustment matrix for 2018.
84,"As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2016 and would be roughly 4%"
85,And our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 11%
86,"And just to be clear, the final discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2017."
87,"Before moving on, I want to point out that consistent with our public filings, we plan to adopt the new retirement benefits standard in the first quarter of 2018, which moves the presentation of certain components of FAS, pension and postretirement benefit expense from operating to non-operating income"
88,We expect the standard to increase operating income due to the removal of all components of SAS expense other than service costs
89,"Likewise, we expect non-operating income to decrease by the same amount with no impact to net income"
90,"As a result, our FAS/CAS adjustment will be split into FAS/CAS operating income and FAS/CAS non-operating expense"
91,We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our year-end call in January
92,"Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and are targeting returning approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet"
93,"In summary, we had another strong quarter"
94,"Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow were at or above our expectations"
95,We remain well positioned with both our domestic and international customers' priority areas
96,"We increased our full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS, updated the sales growth range to 5% to 6% and have a solid foundation for continued growth in 2018."
97,"With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions"
98,Question-and-Answer Session
99,Good morning
100,"Hi Cai, it's Toby"
101,I'll start and then Tom can jump in here if he wants to add some color to it
102,I'll maybe start with 2018 and work my way back here a little bit
103,"But for 2018, we're early in our process"
104,"But I'll tell you for Forcepoint, we are looking at about a 10% plus or minus top-line growth and double-digit margins"
105,So that's kind of how we're thinking of things going forward
106,"In the quarter, the sales at Forcepoint were up about 2%"
107,"If you adjust for their legacy filtering business that we've talked about in the past has been dwindling, it was about a 5% increase in the quarter"
108,We're seeing good growth around network security and also for data and in cyber threat security
109,"We've also seen a little bit of a challenge from timing, both in the Global Governments business here in the third quarter, and as we've talked about, as we've tried to move further up the food chain on the commercial side, selling into large and very large enterprises, that sales cycle time has become a little bit longer and a little bit harder to predict"
110,"And that's what you're seeing here, both in Q3 and the outlook for the year"
111,"I will say that in the third quarter, the margin was within our expectations"
112,The team did a good job driving the margin in the quarter
113,"And as I said in my opening remarks, a year-over-year decrease was expected because, taking it back to the beginning of the year, we talked about a $25 million investment in the business, a lot of that focused in the areas of sales and marketing"
114,"And therefore, what you see in the fourth quarter is the continuation of that investment, okay, which is, you're right, is driving the margins down on a sequential basis"
115,"But again, that all said, we feel everything that we've done this year between the investments, a couple bolt-on acquisitions, is positioning the business for that 10% plus or minus top-line growth, and double-digit margin in 2018."
116,How are you doing?
117,"Yeah, Rich, it's Toby and Tom can jump in here"
118,"But as far as the initial outlook for 2018, think of it more towards the President's request and keep in mind to the degree that we may have any upside from that, given that it would be the instant year"
119,", it's more likely to be a favorable impact on the bookings where we said we'd have a book-to-bill ratio of greater of 1."
120,"The sales profit impact from that would really, if we do see something higher than the President's request, would really materialize more in 2019 and beyond"
121,"And yes, we had about $165 million of adjustments"
122,"One thing on that I'll just remind everybody that the majority of those adjustments are when we have under-runs on cost-type programs and we do continually work with our customers to convert those under-runs into new work, new scope, i"
123,", new bookings, either on current programs or future bookings"
124,"And again, we increased our bookings outlook for the year by $500 million, so we're pleased with where we're positioned right now"
125,"You got the numbers right on the Q4 revenue growth, I think from an overall company point of view and also for Missile Systems"
126,"And at Missiles for the year, we have improved our guidance range on the low-end and see Missiles total year sales growing by about 10%"
127,"As you noted, Q4 is strong with high double-digit growth expected"
128,"We're well positioned across the entire Missiles portfolio with the strong backlog and we do expect to see that additional sales volume really coming from the startup of some recent awards as well as some Q4 awards, some of which will relieve inventory balances and this kind of gets back to Tom's point about where our customers, from a demand perspective, want our products and they want them sooner or they want them quicker"
129,"So, where it makes sense, we've been working with our customers to try to do that and"
130,"part of the growth in the fourth quarter at Missiles, as I said, is the â€“ is reflective of that, with inventory being converted to revenue to drive that growth"
131,Yeah
132,Do you want me to â€
133,"“ Tom, if you want, I'll cover the Forcepoint question"
134,Yeah
135,So Forcepoint does have a couple elements of seasonality
136,"So in Q3, typically it's the peak quarter from a government booking perspective and we saw that again here this year and in Q4, it's really the peak for commercial"
137,"So we did see the spike-up in revenue in Q3 driven by our government orders, but also some strength on the commercial side"
138,"We do expect strong commercial bookings in Q4, which typically convert to sales at a bit slower pace than the rest of the business, think more leaning towards some subscription-based sales versus licenses in the fourth quarter"
139,"Good morning, Sam"
140,"So, Sam, this is Toby"
141,I'll take a crack at that starting out
142,I mean we've said it before
143,", Tom or I might have mentioned it earlier on, in any given period, bookings can be lumpy"
144,"We are expecting, as an example, you mentioned IDS, right, and they had a strong Q1 for bookings"
145,"There was nothing significant in Q3, but we do expect their book-to-bill, as an example, in the fourth quarter to be well over 1 and approaching 1 for the year"
146,They have some significant opportunities in front of them
147,Tom alluded to a few of them when he was kind of going around the world talking about the threat and the demand environment
148,"And then when you take it down to a total company perspective, 1.11 in the quarter, last year was 1.16, 1.08 book-to-bill on a rolling four-quarters basis and our outlook for the year at 1.07, there's nothing there other than positive news relative to be able to sustain, certainly, for 2018 that 3% to 5% growth that I talked about earlier"
149,Thank you
150,Good morning
151,"And maybe â€“ I know your question's largely focused around the margins, but maybe I'll kind of give you a little bit more color across all the metrics here"
152,Keeping in mind that our intent today is give everybody a high-level look at how we're thinking about 2018.
153,"And as we continue to work through our process through the balance of the year, we'll obviously give you details, more details by business in January"
154,"But if I start at the front end of the business, as I said, another book-to-bill ratio over 1, again even on the higher expected sales that as I mentioned, 3% to 5% growth"
155,"I would tell you that the growth next year is a little bit more weighted towards Missiles, but we do see growth in every segment and we also continue to see both domestic and international growth again next year"
156,"Specifically, on your question around margins, again, up slightly from 2017 for segment margins"
157,"And just to give a little bit of color, at this point, we do see some incremental improvement next year at IDS, to your question, they're executing well"
158,We expect to get a little bit more of a lift in 2018 from IDS and also some improvement at IIS
159,"Right now, we'd look at Missiles to be in line with 2017"
160,"and we do have some mix-driven headwind, if you will, at SAS"
161,"As I talked about earlier, strong cash flow in line with 2017."
162,"We're looking at higher cash flow being generated by the businesses, partially offsetting as we expected and have talked about before, higher pension contributions and higher cash taxes, mentioned the tax rate at 31%"
163,"And of course, we gave you the grid"
164,"I gave you the outlook or at least not the outlook, but the current status as of today for discount rate as well as the asset returns which â€"
165,"“ I know doesn't pinpoint it exactly, but think of it a little bit ahead of where the new outlook for 2017 is, plus or minus in the $400 million range for the FAS/CAS"
166,and I talked about Forcepoint
167,"So hopefully, that helps you a little bit understand how we're thinking about things"
168,and again we'll go through more details by business in January
