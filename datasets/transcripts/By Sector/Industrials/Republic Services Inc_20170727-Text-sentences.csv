1,"Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $176 million or 7.5% over the prior year"
2,This 7.5% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 7.2% and acquisitions of 30 basis points
3,The components of internal growth are as follows:
4,"First, average yield increased 2.5%"
5,"Average yield in the collection business was 3.1%, which included 4.2% yield in the small container business, 3% yield in the large container business and 1.9% yield in the residential business"
6,"Average yield in the post-collection business was 80 basis points, which included landfill MSW of 1.8%"
7,A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions
8,"Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%"
9,Core price consisted of 5.3% in the open market and 2.2% in the restricted portion of our business
10,Pricing in the restricted portion of our business benefited from an improved inflationary environment and our focus on earning an appropriate return on our contracts as they renew
11,"The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 1.9% over the prior year"
12,Volumes in the collection business increased 40 basis points
13,"This included a 1.9% increase in our large container business and a 50 basis point increase in our residential business, partially offset by a 90 basis point decrease in our small container business"
14,"Small container volumes included a 140 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable"
15,"Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 50 basis points"
16,"Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 1.7% and recurring hauls were up 1.9%"
17,"The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 8.7%"
18,"Landfill volumes increased 8.4% which included C&D of 17.5%, special waste of 15% and MSW of 1.1%"
19,"The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 60 basis points"
20,The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel
21,"The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.55 in the second quarter from $2.30 in the prior year, an increase of 11%"
22,The current average diesel price is $2.51 per gallon
23,"The next component, energy services revenue, increased 70 basis points"
24,The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we are well positioned
25,"And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue, which increased 1.5%"
26,The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to increase in recycled commodity prices
27,"Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 35% to $157 per ton in the second quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year"
28,The average commodity price in June was approximately $160 per ton
29,Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 49% primarily due to an increase in rebates
30,"Now, I'll discuss changes in margin"
31,"Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, which compares to 28.3% in the prior year"
32,The change includes a 40 basis point increase in landfill operating costs
33,"As discussed in the first quarter, we continued to see higher costs associated with the change in operating requirements at one of our sites"
34,We also saw an increase in leachate volumes at a handful of our sites
35,These costs are temporary in nature and we expect the higher landfill operating costs to abate over the next few quarters
36,"Excluding the increase in landfill operating costs, we had 10 basis points of margin expansion from strong pricing and volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business"
37,I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing
38,"Second quarter 2017 interest was $90 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization"
39,Our adjusted effective tax rate was 39.1%
40,We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year
41,"Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $358 million, which represents 6% growth over the prior year"
42,"We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $875 million to $900 million, which represents double-digit growth over the prior year, after adjusting for the change in cash taxes"
43,Now I'll turn the call back to Don
44,"So, so far we spent about 53% of our CapEx first half of the year"
45,"As we look at over the rest of the year, obviously we had very strong volume growth first half of the year and therefore because of that we may need to increase our capital spending to fund that growth"
46,And that's why we haven't changed our free cash flow guidance
47,Yeah
48,"It was obviously accretive to the margins, but keep in mind that when you're talking about the COGS that 20% of the tons that we handled are brokered by us"
49,"So, if you actually exclude those volumes and those brokered volumes, then our sale of materials and our COGS went up by a similar rate of approximately 30%"
50,Thank you
51,"So obviously, we posted a very strong revenue first half of the year, so"
52,"that's where that EPS guidance increase is coming from and then that's been partially offset and what I talked about earlier about the temporary increase that we're seeing in our landfill operating costs, so it's the net of those two"
53,"Yeah, we say over the next few quarters, most of that's going to take place this year"
54,"Hey, Joe"
55,Yeah
56,"So when we look at the back half of the year, obviously we're expecting expansion in the margins and that's really coming from the strong revenue"
57,"At the same time, as I had talked about before though, these landfill costs are going to slowly abate"
58,"So, we're going to have that headwind associated with also"
59,"So as we're looking at the margin, it's kind of longer term"
60,We're thinking that we're going to be flat for the year
61,"But if you take out the landfill operating costs, then that would get us right back to the 30 or 40 basis points of expansion that we had anticipated"
62,Yeah
63,"So, in terms of the incentive comp, keep in mind that we had an adjustment last year to incentive compensation that didn't repeat this year"
64,"And so obviously, our incentive is currently at levels that are consistent with our guidance for the rest of the year"
65,"Thanks, Noah (sic)"
66,[Joe]
67,I think you should just drop the mic at that point
68,and we'll walk away
69,Hey Brian
70,So what happened is that we actually saw some of that acceleration in Q2 and that's why we're able to post a restricted price of 2.2%
71,So those resets have already started to happen
72,"In addition to that, as I had mentioned before, we were able to actually renegotiate some of our contracts on favorable terms, those restricted contracts"
73,So we've got that coming through under restricted price also
74,"So as we look out for the rest of the year, we think that that restricted price and yield in general is going to be pretty much flat to where it was in Q2."
75,So there is one less work day and obviously that work day is included in our guidance
76,"And what we had talked, obviously the revenue growth has been very, very strong and commodities has been strong also"
77,"If you were to pull there â€“ as I said, if you were to pull out these one-time landfill costs we'd have achieved kind of the high end of our guidance range in terms of our EBITDA margin growth year-over-year"
78,"As we look out into the future as these costs abate, there is still nothing structural that we see that'll keep us from getting back to 30% EBITDA margins that we had talked about, so that still demonstrates the leverage that we expect from this business"
79,The other thing I would say also Hamzah is that it's not just the EBITDA that we're focusing on
80,", it's also the cash flow"
81,And I had a very wise man telling me one time that you can't spend EBITDA
82,and we are focusing on the cash
83,And keep in mind that the cash flow guidance that we gave this year is double-digit when you adjust for cash taxes
84,So that's a very key metric for us also
85,"Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
86,Right
87,That's helpful
88,That makes sense
89,"Just a clarification question on, did you guys have CNG tax credits that went away or was that impactful at all or not material?"
90,"Those credits went away this year, so we did not have those credits this year"
91,"Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
92,"No, there's really no cost that we have that are impacting those landfill operating costs that Don had talked about"
93,"So, obviously there is leverage there that we had talked about"
94,We expect that we're going to continue to be able grow that top line
95,like we have
96,You've got the work day in Q3 which is a benefit for us also
97,"So, it's a combination of all those factors"
98,On that one â€“ we are?
99,"Like I said, Michael, it could go up a little bit because of the volume growth"
100,"Little bit could go up by $5 million, $10 million, maybe in that range"
101,"Yeah, somewhere in that range"
102,"There is Michael, and it goes back to what we had said before, is that if you pull out, just pull out the landfill operating costs, you've got 10 basis points of margin expansion during the quarter"
103,"And if you do that for the entire year, you've got 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion"
104,That's right on top of the guidance that we had given
105,"So, yeah, the leverage is there"
106,"Yeah, 30 to 40, right"
107,"So, again, we talk about several times on the call, right, mix matters, right"
108,"And we are confident that the margins are expanding within the business, we got some of these highlights like recycling and fuel and some of the things that just net things out, but business is strong, the growth is good, pricing is good, operating team's doing a great job"
109,We've got a couple of sort of near-term temporary and unusual things to take care of
110,and then we should really
111,I think end the year strong and move nicely into 2018.
112,"Well, you remember, you have seasonality"
113,And those are seasonal for sure
