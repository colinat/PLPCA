0,"Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone"
1,Iâ€™ll start my comments on page four which is the first quarter key financial information
2,"Sales in the quarter were $1,490 million, an increase of 4.5% compared to Q1 last year"
3,Sales increased 3.8% on an organic basis
4,Acquisitions contributed 1.8% to growth and currency translations reduced sales in the quarter by 1.1%
5,"Segment operating margin was 21.2%, 50 basis points higher than Q1 last year and primarily due to higher sales and lower spending and despite the restoration of incentive compensation that we talked about in the November guidance"
6,Spending was a bit light in the first quarter and you should expect spending to increase as we proceed into the balance of the year
7,The margin result also reflected a good productivity result in Q1 including savings from our restructuring actions in Q4 last year
8,General corporate net expense was $15 million compared to $18 million a year ago
9,"Adjusted earnings per share were $1.75, an increase of $0.26 or 17% compared to the first quarter of last year"
10,"The increase is due to the combination of higher sales, improved margins and a lower tax rate"
11,The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.1% compared to 22.8% in Q1 last year
12,"As expected, the adjusted effective rate in Q1 included a significant benefit from discreet tax items"
13,We talked about this benefit when we provided guidance in November
14,A relatively small part of the discrete tax benefit was due to our adoption of the new accounting standard regarding equity based compensation
15,"Free cash flow for Q1 was $271 million, free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 119%"
16,Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 34.6%
17,"And a couple of other items, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.7 million, down about 2% compared to last year and during the first quarter, we repurchased almost 650,000 shares at a cost of about $81 million"
18,"At the end of the quarter, we had $864 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization"
19,The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment
20,Page five is the Architecture & Software segment
21,"Beginning on the left side of this page, Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q1, up 8.3% compared to Q1 last year"
22,"The organic sales increase was 7.6%, currency translation reduced sales by 1% and acquisitions contributed 1.7% to sales growth"
23,"Moving to the right side of the chart, A&S margins were 30%, up 2.6 points compared to prior year and primarily due to the operating leverage associated with higher sales coupled with lower spending"
24,"Moving to page six, the Control Products & Solutions segment"
25,"In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $794 million, up 1.3% year-over-year"
26,"Organic sales increased 0.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 1.9% to growth"
27,"In the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales increase was about 3%, solutions and services sales were down about 1% organically"
28,The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.11.
29,"CP&S operating margin was 13.6% in Q1, down 1.7 points year-over-year, the biggest factor being higher incentive compensation costs"
30,"Moving to page seven, this provides a breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter"
31,"Blake covered much of this in his remarks, Iâ€™ll add just a couple of comments"
32,The organic sales growth in Q1 was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific and North America
33,Asia-Pacific was up 20% year-over-year with China and India each up mid-teens
34,We experienced strong growth in both product and solutions and services businesses in the region
35,"The strong growth in Asia-Pacific was admittedly off[ph] relatively easy comparisons and as Blake mentioned, sales performance benefited from some favorable timing on larger projects that we thought would hit later in the year"
36,"Overall for the company, organic growth for emerging markets was 11% this quarter"
37,And that takes us to the guidance slide
38,"As Blake mentioned, weâ€™re making some changes, primarily based on the better than expected sales performance in Q1, weâ€™re increasing our expectations for organic growth by one point across the range to a midpoint for organic growth of 3% for the full year compared to the previous 2% and the new range of 1% to 5% organic growth"
39,"The better than expected organic growth in Q1 accounts for most of the increase the organic growth guidance for the full year, though our outlook for sales for the balance of the year remains reasonably constant with our November guidance"
40,"Based on recent currency rates, we now expect the larger headwind from currency translation, the headwind increasing from about 0.5 point to a little less than 2 points"
41,We still expect total sales to be a little over $6 billion with the additional currency headwind offsetting the higher organic growth
42,Our previous margin guidance was about 20%
43,In November I said may be that would be a little lower than 20%
44,Now we think maybe itâ€™s a little higher than 20%
45,"Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 24%, we now expect that to be closer to 23.5% and basically that reflects a somewhat higher discrete tax benefit in Q1 than we previously thought"
46,Weâ€™re revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.85 to $6.25 to a new range of $5.95 to $6.35 and the midpoint increases from $6.05 to $6.15.
47,"For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversions to be above 100% of adjusted income"
48,"A couple of items not shown here, we now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $70 million for the full year"
49,"Also, we now expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 129.5 million, thatâ€™s about 1.5 million shares higher than the November guidance"
50,We continue to expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases this year but the share prices increased
51,"Before I turn it over to Patrick to begin our Q&A session, as Blake noted, this will be my final earnings call as CFO"
52,Iâ€™d just like to say that it has been an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer at Rockwell Automation
53,"As you can imagine, itâ€™s a lot easier job when youâ€™re representing a great company with such great culture and such great people"
54,Iâ€™m really pleased to have Patrick Goris succeed me as CFO
55,Most of you have gotten to known him over the past few years in his industrial relations role
56,He has a great breadth of financial management experience across our different businesses and functions
57,Heâ€™s very well prepared for this
58,and I know heâ€™s going to do a great job
59,Iâ€™ve really enjoyed the CFO role in the past 10 years
60,"Part of that was the opportunity to interact with all of you, the analysts and the investors"
61,"I learned a lot from your questions, the challenges and sometimes your different views on the industry and the company"
62,Iâ€™m excited to be moving back to an operating role where I think I can make a different contribution [indiscernible]
63,"I wonâ€™t be interacting with this group as often going forward, but if not before then, I look forward to seeing many of you at the next Automation Fair"
64,"And since this is my last earnings call, I expect you all to take it easy on me in Q&A"
65,"So thank you and over to you, Patrick"
66,Thank you
67,"Scott, I think too in this quarter from a vertical perspective, the acceleration we saw was largely in consumer and transportation"
68,Yeah
69,I mean I think the spending is more
70,Itâ€™s not so much about capacity and supply chain
71,The spending is going to be more about R&D and commercial expenses and very much targeted some of the new opportunities we have related to connective enterprise
72,Thank you
73,"Good morning, John"
74,And the first thing I would say is we mentioned that there were some pool-ins
75,", we think there were some pool-ins of jobs we expected to hit later in the year, that was true in Asia generally, but particularly in China"
76,"I would say the vertical profile that we experienced most of last year which was strength particularly in consumer to a lesser extent in transportation and weakness in heavy industry, that continued but we had particularly strong quarter entire in China"
77,Heavy industry was better although still weaker and I donâ€
78,™t think -- we do not expect China to be 15% growth for the full year
79,We still think for the full year an expectation of something in the mid-single digits is appropriate
80,"Iâ€™m not sure I know exactly how to quantify that, but my guess would be may be half of the growth in the quarter"
81,was kind of pool-ins and unique to Rockwell projects
82,And the other half was kind of underlying market
83,"Yeah, so may be just to start with little context"
84,"based company, but we serve a global customer sect and our global supply chain has been constructed to serve those customers all around the world"
85,"Today, we are a net importer into the U.S"
86,", but I think itâ€™s very important to note that weâ€™ve got flexibility in our global supply chain"
87,and we believe we could make adjustments if there were changes in the tax law that made that appropriate
88,Yes
89,"Dan, I would say that the quarter played out in a pretty typical fashion which is it started a little bit slower and then picked up as we moved through the quarter"
90,I would say may be
91,"the only unusual thing in the quarter was, a last couple of weeks in December were stronger than normal and itâ€™s the reason that we think there might have been a little bit of budget flush particularly in North America"
92,"January has started off slowly as a typical January, but things have picked up a little bit as the month is going on"
93,Unidentified Analyst Great
94,"And then just as a quick follow up, what was auto for you guys in the quarter, I guess both globally and do you have any color on strength by region?"
95,So auto was up over 10% in the quarter
96,Unidentified Analyst Got it
97,So Nigel Iâ€™m not sure I know
98,I donâ€
99,™t know that we know what caused the budget flush
100,"We heard that comment from several of our distributors and we also observed that there was a little bit higher than normal order rate in those last couple of weeks in December, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re speculating that there may have been some higher than normal budget"
101,flush
102,"In terms of distributor inventories, particularly in North America, we have very good visibility on that and distributor inventories were up slightly from September"
103,I think itâ€™s more about the latter
104,I mean basically weâ€™ve got more currency headwind now
105,", top-line and bottom-line as a consequence of whatâ€™s happened with exchange rate"
106,"There were also the higher spending in the latter half of the year, some of that is just a ketchup from under-spending in Q1, but we also believe weâ€™re going to spend a little bit more in total for the year now consistent with higher organic growth"
107,And then incentive comp will also be higher as a consequence of higher organic growth and higher EPS
108,Good morning
109,"Shannon I also think when we debriefed our sales organization this quarter, we did hear kind of a more positive sentiment both from our own sales people and from the channel that would have been the case six months ago"
110,"After the last two years, what weâ€™ve experienced the last couple quarters is getting close to flat year-over-year, that feels pretty good actually"
111,"We do think thereâ€™s potential for some improvement as we move through this year, but for the full year, we still think itâ€™s going to be close to flat"
112,Thank you
113,"Hi, Jeff"
114,The A&S business in Q1 was pretty similar to the balance of the company in Q1.
115,It was strong growth
116,Youâ€™re exactly right
117,"I mean the year-over-year margin impact of incentive comp was pretty similar in the two segments, with almost 8% organic growth in A&S"
118,", it just got us swamped that impact"
119,"Well, so couple of things, first Maverick will not lose money, so weâ€™re not expecting in the first year for both purchase accounting and integration cost that weâ€™ll get a significant profit contribution from those sales"
120,"On the CP&S core, I donâ€"
121,"™t think I would say this performance was significantly worse than historic results, but I would say if weâ€™re going to have some margin pressure in this business compared to last year, I mean we had a particularly good margin performance last year, that included some higher margin project business that isnâ€™t going to repeat this year"
122,"And as we progress through the year with downturns and heavy industry and the pressure, weâ€™ve got some lower margin projects in the backlog theyâ€™re going to work their way out this year as a consequence of some more aggressive pricing"
123,So weâ€™re going to have some margin pressure in that business this year
124,"I think that our full year margins will be a little bit lower than last year, but I donâ€"
125,™t expect them to get worse as we proceed through the year compared to the first quarter
126,"See may be think about it this way, thereâ€™s probably about $10 million that we under-spent in Q1 that weâ€™re going to catch up on now in the balance of the year and compared to our previous guidance, thereâ€™s another incremental $10 million that we now expect to spend"
127,Thank you
128,Good morning
129,I think you can think of that for this year itâ€™s kind of low-to-mid teens
130,"Well I mean the larger projects pulled forward primarily occurred in Asia-Pacific, it was kind of a combination of cross vertical as it affected both transportation and heavy industry"
131,", semi-conductor was one of those"
132,"Look Steve, if I had to estimate, I would estimate that our organic growth in the first quarter between project pull forwards and potential budget flush, may be 1 point of the organic growth was related to that"
133,"And even if you take that out, this was still a better quarter than we expected"
134,Well I think there are two things you ought to think about
135,", one is our normal merit increases occur basically effective January 1st across the company and so sequentially, there will be a step-up in spending probably about $10 million on a sequentially quarterly basis, itâ€™s just a consequence of that merit increase"
136,"And then in addition to that, youâ€™ll start to see us ramp what I would call more underlying spending"
137,"and I think that will ramp as we proceed through the year,"
138,so probably a little lower in Q2 and a little bit higher in Q3 and Q4.
139,"I think on sales, youâ€™ll see some increase from Q1 but not a lot of sequential growth in Q2, Q3 then you ought to expect kind of a step-up in Q4 which is typical for us on a seasonal basis"
140,Thatâ€™s correct
141,We think weâ€™re probably about $250 million in net importer
142,"Rich, I think itâ€™s fair to think about that increase as primarily transportation and consumer"
143,I think thatâ€™s fair
144,"I mean I think Blake mentioned earlier, weâ€™re hearing some better things about potential investment in heavy industry, but weâ€™re not seeing it translate into orders yet"
145,The only thing I would remind you of is because there were no incentive compensation earned last year
146,", there was no payout this year either in the first quarter or in the balance of the year"
147,"So, thatâ€™s going to contribute somewhat to a better conversion on the year"
148,Thatâ€™s probably the most important thing
149,Yeah I would say may be now itâ€™s mid-to-high singles
150,I think itâ€™s fair to say that thereâ€™s a general optimism but front log is flat and itâ€™s still early in the year
151,Our backlog overall is up a little bit and â€
152,“ positive signs
153,"Importantly, weâ€™re releasing new products and that has an impact as well, but itâ€™s still early to call this a different trajectory in terms of the outlined months"
154,"Yeah, so itâ€™s"
155,I think weâ€™re encouraged by some of the things that are being talked about around U.S
156,corporate tax rate and house proposal thatâ€™s been put out there
157,we think addresses a number of important issues that currently created disadvantage for U.S
158,"based companies, a lot of corporate tax rate, territorial tax system, potential to repatriate foreign earnings"
159,We view all of those as positive for Rockwell for U.S
160,manufacturers and for U.S
161,economic growth generally
162,"Specifically as it relates to repatriation, what we would repatriate ultimately would depend on the rate -- the tax rate that would apply to that and any conditions that might apply to the repatriation"
163,But we probably currently have about $2 billion that could be repatriated at some point
164,"Those funds if repatriated, could be used for investments in organic growth, they could be used for acquisitions especially U.S"
165,"based companies, it could be used for retirement of debt or better funding of our pension plans, or to return to shareowners through dividend repurchases"
166,"And once we get a clearer view on what the conditions might be, weâ€™ll be prepared to talk in a little more detail about specifically about how we would use it"
167,We havenâ€™t passed on attractive acquisitions in the past for a lack of U.S
168,"We continue to look at acquisitions as opportunities to accelerate what weâ€™re doing in terms of technology, domain expertise to market access"
169,And weâ€™re pleased with the results of our recent acquisition
170,", weâ€™ll talk more about the need to be present in M&A to accelerate our strategy, so"
171,I donâ€
172,™t really see it as a significant accelerator to the amount of M&A we would otherwise do
173,"I think if you were to look at where the concentration of our activity is, itâ€™s really in that the new value that come from information solutions and connected services"
174,"So in the network space, in the software space it sits up above the real-time control, those are the areas where weâ€™re probably relatively active and itâ€™s spread across the world, itâ€™s not constrained to any one geography"
175,Unidentified Analyst Understood
176,And could you just quantify the impact of incentive comp on CP&S margins for the quarter please?
177,It was approximately one point
178,Unidentified Analyst Great
179,Thank you
180,"Joe, I think whatâ€™s reflected in our current guidance is what we talked about in November which we think for the full year price will be little less than a point and similar to what it was last year"
181,"If the economy heats up, who knows,"
182,I mean maybe pricing could be a little better
183,"So in answering the first question which is about the top-line, I mean may be the way to think about the higher end of the range is, clearly, we had a better organic growth result in Q2 than we were expecting coming into the year"
184,"But basically, we have not changed our balance of the year guidance"
185,"So if Q2 is truly kind of a new baseline, and we should expect the same sequential growth we were originally expecting in the November guidance, thatâ€™s a way to think about how we would get to the higher end of the range on the top-line"
186,Our conversion now in the new guidance is about 20% which is almost double what it was in our November guidance and thatâ€™s
187,the spike the headwinds we talked about November around incentive compensation and pension in particular
188,"So, there will be some better conversion at the higher end than we would see at the low end or midpoint"
189,One of the things weâ€™ve always talked about is weâ€™re
190,not all that capital intensive as it relates to growth
191,"With immediate deductibility of CapEx, is it possible we might spend more than we originally planned, I think itâ€™s possible"
192,but I donâ€
193,™t think thatâ€™s a very big number particularly compared to the amount of earnings weâ€™ve got sitting overseas
194,Well I mean I would love to think that weâ€™re going to start to see some improvement in heavy industries as we proceed through the year
195,But we havenâ€™t seen that yet and itâ€™s not reflected in the guidance
196,I mean I think our solutions and services business
197,"right now we believe will be about flat year-over-year and any improvement that does start to occur in heavy industry, for a significant part of that business, we really need to see it in Q2 or may be early Q3 in order for that to have an impact on shipments in the year"
198,"I think the Q1 performance in EMEA was just more about timing of when projects hit, principally in the solutions and services businesses"
199,Thank you
200,So I would say it was primarily advanced into the second quarter and it was not all A&S
201,it was kind of a combination of A&S and CP&S
202,"Thatâ€™s correct, we do not expect A&S margin at 30% for the balance of the year, we expect lower margins for A&S for the balance of the year"
203,"Eli, maybe itâ€™s"
204,a little bit different approach to the answer
205,"and this is not intended in any way to be a political commentary, but"
206,I donâ€
207,™t think weâ€™re hearing anything from investors that would cause us to believe that what we saw as the acceleration in the first quarter is related to upcoming potential tax changes
208,Thank you
