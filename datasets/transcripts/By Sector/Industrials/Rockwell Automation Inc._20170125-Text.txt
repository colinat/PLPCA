Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone
I’ll start my comments on page four which is the first quarter key financial information
Sales in the quarter were $1,490 million, an increase of 4.5% compared to Q1 last year
Sales increased 3.8% on an organic basis
Acquisitions contributed 1.8% to growth and currency translations reduced sales in the quarter by 1.1%
Segment operating margin was 21.2%, 50 basis points higher than Q1 last year and primarily due to higher sales and lower spending and despite the restoration of incentive compensation that we talked about in the November guidance
Spending was a bit light in the first quarter and you should expect spending to increase as we proceed into the balance of the year
The margin result also reflected a good productivity result in Q1 including savings from our restructuring actions in Q4 last year
General corporate net expense was $15 million compared to $18 million a year ago
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.75, an increase of $0.26 or 17% compared to the first quarter of last year
The increase is due to the combination of higher sales, improved margins and a lower tax rate
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.1% compared to 22.8% in Q1 last year
As expected, the adjusted effective rate in Q1 included a significant benefit from discreet tax items
We talked about this benefit when we provided guidance in November
A relatively small part of the discrete tax benefit was due to our adoption of the new accounting standard regarding equity based compensation
Free cash flow for Q1 was $271 million, free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 119%
Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 34.6%
And a couple of other items, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.7 million, down about 2% compared to last year and during the first quarter, we repurchased almost 650,000 shares at a cost of about $81 million
At the end of the quarter, we had $864 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization
The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment
Page five is the Architecture & Software segment
Beginning on the left side of this page, Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q1, up 8.3% compared to Q1 last year
The organic sales increase was 7.6%, currency translation reduced sales by 1% and acquisitions contributed 1.7% to sales growth
Moving to the right side of the chart, A&S margins were 30%, up 2.6 points compared to prior year and primarily due to the operating leverage associated with higher sales coupled with lower spending
Moving to page six, the Control Products & Solutions segment
In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $794 million, up 1.3% year-over-year
Organic sales increased 0.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 1.9% to growth
In the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales increase was about 3%, solutions and services sales were down about 1% organically
The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.11. CP&S operating margin was 13.6% in Q1, down 1.7 points year-over-year, the biggest factor being higher incentive compensation costs
Moving to page seven, this provides a breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter
Blake covered much of this in his remarks, I’ll add just a couple of comments
The organic sales growth in Q1 was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific and North America
Asia-Pacific was up 20% year-over-year with China and India each up mid-teens
We experienced strong growth in both product and solutions and services businesses in the region
The strong growth in Asia-Pacific was admittedly off[ph] relatively easy comparisons and as Blake mentioned, sales performance benefited from some favorable timing on larger projects that we thought would hit later in the year
Overall for the company, organic growth for emerging markets was 11% this quarter
And that takes us to the guidance slide
As Blake mentioned, we’re making some changes, primarily based on the better than expected sales performance in Q1, we’re increasing our expectations for organic growth by one point across the range to a midpoint for organic growth of 3% for the full year compared to the previous 2% and the new range of 1% to 5% organic growth
The better than expected organic growth in Q1 accounts for most of the increase the organic growth guidance for the full year, though our outlook for sales for the balance of the year remains reasonably constant with our November guidance
Based on recent currency rates, we now expect the larger headwind from currency translation, the headwind increasing from about 0.5 point to a little less than 2 points
We still expect total sales to be a little over $6 billion with the additional currency headwind offsetting the higher organic growth
Our previous margin guidance was about 20%
In November I said may be that would be a little lower than 20%
Now we think maybe it’s a little higher than 20%
Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 24%, we now expect that to be closer to 23.5% and basically that reflects a somewhat higher discrete tax benefit in Q1 than we previously thought
We’re revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.85 to $6.25 to a new range of $5.95 to $6.35 and the midpoint increases from $6.05 to $6.15. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversions to be above 100% of adjusted income
A couple of items not shown here, we now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $70 million for the full year
Also, we now expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 129.5 million, that’s about 1.5 million shares higher than the November guidance
We continue to expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases this year but the share prices increased
Before I turn it over to Patrick to begin our Q&A session, as Blake noted, this will be my final earnings call as CFO
I’d just like to say that it has been an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer at Rockwell Automation
As you can imagine, it’s a lot easier job when you’re representing a great company with such great culture and such great people
I’m really pleased to have Patrick Goris succeed me as CFO
Most of you have gotten to known him over the past few years in his industrial relations role
He has a great breadth of financial management experience across our different businesses and functions
He’s very well prepared for this and I know he’s going to do a great job
I’ve really enjoyed the CFO role in the past 10 years
Part of that was the opportunity to interact with all of you, the analysts and the investors
I learned a lot from your questions, the challenges and sometimes your different views on the industry and the company
I’m excited to be moving back to an operating role where I think I can make a different contribution [indiscernible]
I won’t be interacting with this group as often going forward, but if not before then, I look forward to seeing many of you at the next Automation Fair
And since this is my last earnings call, I expect you all to take it easy on me in Q&A
So thank you and over to you, Patrick
Thank you
Scott, I think too in this quarter from a vertical perspective, the acceleration we saw was largely in consumer and transportation
Yeah I mean I think the spending is more
It’s not so much about capacity and supply chain
The spending is going to be more about R&D and commercial expenses and very much targeted some of the new opportunities we have related to connective enterprise
Thank you
Good morning, John
And the first thing I would say is we mentioned that there were some pool-ins, we think there were some pool-ins of jobs we expected to hit later in the year, that was true in Asia generally, but particularly in China
I would say the vertical profile that we experienced most of last year which was strength particularly in consumer to a lesser extent in transportation and weakness in heavy industry, that continued but we had particularly strong quarter entire in China
Heavy industry was better although still weaker and I don’t think -- we do not expect China to be 15% growth for the full year
We still think for the full year an expectation of something in the mid-single digits is appropriate
I’m not sure I know exactly how to quantify that, but my guess would be may be half of the growth in the quarter was kind of pool-ins and unique to Rockwell projects
And the other half was kind of underlying market
Yeah, so may be just to start with little context
based company, but we serve a global customer sect and our global supply chain has been constructed to serve those customers all around the world
Today, we are a net importer into the U.S
, but I think it’s very important to note that we’ve got flexibility in our global supply chain and we believe we could make adjustments if there were changes in the tax law that made that appropriate
Yes
Dan, I would say that the quarter played out in a pretty typical fashion which is it started a little bit slower and then picked up as we moved through the quarter
I would say may be the only unusual thing in the quarter was, a last couple of weeks in December were stronger than normal and it’s the reason that we think there might have been a little bit of budget flush particularly in North America
January has started off slowly as a typical January, but things have picked up a little bit as the month is going on
Unidentified Analyst Great
And then just as a quick follow up, what was auto for you guys in the quarter, I guess both globally and do you have any color on strength by region?
So auto was up over 10% in the quarter
Unidentified Analyst Got it
So Nigel I’m not sure I know I don’t know that we know what caused the budget flush
We heard that comment from several of our distributors and we also observed that there was a little bit higher than normal order rate in those last couple of weeks in December, that’s why we’re speculating that there may have been some higher than normal budget flush
In terms of distributor inventories, particularly in North America, we have very good visibility on that and distributor inventories were up slightly from September
I think it’s more about the latter
I mean basically we’ve got more currency headwind now, top-line and bottom-line as a consequence of what’s happened with exchange rate
There were also the higher spending in the latter half of the year, some of that is just a ketchup from under-spending in Q1, but we also believe we’re going to spend a little bit more in total for the year now consistent with higher organic growth
And then incentive comp will also be higher as a consequence of higher organic growth and higher EPS
Good morning
Shannon I also think when we debriefed our sales organization this quarter, we did hear kind of a more positive sentiment both from our own sales people and from the channel that would have been the case six months ago
After the last two years, what we’ve experienced the last couple quarters is getting close to flat year-over-year, that feels pretty good actually
We do think there’s potential for some improvement as we move through this year, but for the full year, we still think it’s going to be close to flat
Thank you
Hi, Jeff
The A&S business in Q1 was pretty similar to the balance of the company in Q1. It was strong growth
You’re exactly right
I mean the year-over-year margin impact of incentive comp was pretty similar in the two segments, with almost 8% organic growth in A&S, it just got us swamped that impact
Well, so couple of things, first Maverick will not lose money, so we’re not expecting in the first year for both purchase accounting and integration cost that we’ll get a significant profit contribution from those sales
On the CP&S core, I don’t think I would say this performance was significantly worse than historic results, but I would say if we’re going to have some margin pressure in this business compared to last year, I mean we had a particularly good margin performance last year, that included some higher margin project business that isn’t going to repeat this year
And as we progress through the year with downturns and heavy industry and the pressure, we’ve got some lower margin projects in the backlog they’re going to work their way out this year as a consequence of some more aggressive pricing
So we’re going to have some margin pressure in that business this year
I think that our full year margins will be a little bit lower than last year, but I don’t expect them to get worse as we proceed through the year compared to the first quarter
See may be think about it this way, there’s probably about $10 million that we under-spent in Q1 that we’re going to catch up on now in the balance of the year and compared to our previous guidance, there’s another incremental $10 million that we now expect to spend
Thank you
Good morning
I think you can think of that for this year it’s kind of low-to-mid teens
Well I mean the larger projects pulled forward primarily occurred in Asia-Pacific, it was kind of a combination of cross vertical as it affected both transportation and heavy industry, semi-conductor was one of those
Look Steve, if I had to estimate, I would estimate that our organic growth in the first quarter between project pull forwards and potential budget flush, may be 1 point of the organic growth was related to that
And even if you take that out, this was still a better quarter than we expected
Well I think there are two things you ought to think about, one is our normal merit increases occur basically effective January 1st across the company and so sequentially, there will be a step-up in spending probably about $10 million on a sequentially quarterly basis, it’s just a consequence of that merit increase
And then in addition to that, you’ll start to see us ramp what I would call more underlying spending and I think that will ramp as we proceed through the year, so probably a little lower in Q2 and a little bit higher in Q3 and Q4.
I think on sales, you’ll see some increase from Q1 but not a lot of sequential growth in Q2, Q3 then you ought to expect kind of a step-up in Q4 which is typical for us on a seasonal basis
That’s correct
We think we’re probably about $250 million in net importer
Rich, I think it’s fair to think about that increase as primarily transportation and consumer
I think that’s fair
I mean I think Blake mentioned earlier, we’re hearing some better things about potential investment in heavy industry, but we’re not seeing it translate into orders yet
The only thing I would remind you of is because there were no incentive compensation earned last year, there was no payout this year either in the first quarter or in the balance of the year
So, that’s going to contribute somewhat to a better conversion on the year
That’s probably the most important thing
Yeah I would say may be now it’s mid-to-high singles
I think it’s fair to say that there’s a general optimism but front log is flat and it’s still early in the year
Our backlog overall is up a little bit and – positive signs
Importantly, we’re releasing new products and that has an impact as well, but it’s still early to call this a different trajectory in terms of the outlined months
Yeah, so it’s I think we’re encouraged by some of the things that are being talked about around U.S
corporate tax rate and house proposal that’s been put out there we think addresses a number of important issues that currently created disadvantage for U.S
based companies, a lot of corporate tax rate, territorial tax system, potential to repatriate foreign earnings
We view all of those as positive for Rockwell for U.S
manufacturers and for U.S
economic growth generally
Specifically as it relates to repatriation, what we would repatriate ultimately would depend on the rate -- the tax rate that would apply to that and any conditions that might apply to the repatriation
But we probably currently have about $2 billion that could be repatriated at some point
Those funds if repatriated, could be used for investments in organic growth, they could be used for acquisitions especially U.S
based companies, it could be used for retirement of debt or better funding of our pension plans, or to return to shareowners through dividend repurchases
And once we get a clearer view on what the conditions might be, we’ll be prepared to talk in a little more detail about specifically about how we would use it
We haven’t passed on attractive acquisitions in the past for a lack of U.S
We continue to look at acquisitions as opportunities to accelerate what we’re doing in terms of technology, domain expertise to market access
And we’re pleased with the results of our recent acquisition, we’ll talk more about the need to be present in M&A to accelerate our strategy, so I don’t really see it as a significant accelerator to the amount of M&A we would otherwise do
I think if you were to look at where the concentration of our activity is, it’s really in that the new value that come from information solutions and connected services
So in the network space, in the software space it sits up above the real-time control, those are the areas where we’re probably relatively active and it’s spread across the world, it’s not constrained to any one geography
Unidentified Analyst Understood
And could you just quantify the impact of incentive comp on CP&S margins for the quarter please?
It was approximately one point
Unidentified Analyst Great
Thank you
Joe, I think what’s reflected in our current guidance is what we talked about in November which we think for the full year price will be little less than a point and similar to what it was last year
If the economy heats up, who knows, I mean maybe pricing could be a little better
So in answering the first question which is about the top-line, I mean may be the way to think about the higher end of the range is, clearly, we had a better organic growth result in Q2 than we were expecting coming into the year
But basically, we have not changed our balance of the year guidance
So if Q2 is truly kind of a new baseline, and we should expect the same sequential growth we were originally expecting in the November guidance, that’s a way to think about how we would get to the higher end of the range on the top-line
Our conversion now in the new guidance is about 20% which is almost double what it was in our November guidance and that’s the spike the headwinds we talked about November around incentive compensation and pension in particular
So, there will be some better conversion at the higher end than we would see at the low end or midpoint
One of the things we’ve always talked about is we’re not all that capital intensive as it relates to growth
With immediate deductibility of CapEx, is it possible we might spend more than we originally planned, I think it’s possible but I don’t think that’s a very big number particularly compared to the amount of earnings we’ve got sitting overseas
Well I mean I would love to think that we’re going to start to see some improvement in heavy industries as we proceed through the year
But we haven’t seen that yet and it’s not reflected in the guidance
I mean I think our solutions and services business right now we believe will be about flat year-over-year and any improvement that does start to occur in heavy industry, for a significant part of that business, we really need to see it in Q2 or may be early Q3 in order for that to have an impact on shipments in the year
I think the Q1 performance in EMEA was just more about timing of when projects hit, principally in the solutions and services businesses
Thank you
So I would say it was primarily advanced into the second quarter and it was not all A&S it was kind of a combination of A&S and CP&S
That’s correct, we do not expect A&S margin at 30% for the balance of the year, we expect lower margins for A&S for the balance of the year
Eli, maybe it’s a little bit different approach to the answer and this is not intended in any way to be a political commentary, but I don’t think we’re hearing anything from investors that would cause us to believe that what we saw as the acceleration in the first quarter is related to upcoming potential tax changes
Thank you
