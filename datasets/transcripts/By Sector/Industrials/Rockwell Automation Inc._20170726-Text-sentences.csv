0,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone"
1,Thank you for joining us on the call today
2,"I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck"
3,This was another strong quarter for us
4,"Organic growth was 8%, which was in line with our expectations"
5,I'm pleased to see that this growth was broad-based across the regions and industries
6,"Globally, transportation continued to deliver very good growth"
7,"In consumer, food and beverage did well"
8,"Heavy industries were also up in the quarter, including good growth in semiconductor"
9,"Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains solid"
10,"From a regional perspective, the U.S"
11,", our largest market grew 8%"
12,We saw growth in most verticals led by strong performance in transportation
13,"EMEA was flat year-over-year, as expected"
14,The timing of projects is driving some quarter-to-quarter variability in our growth rates
15,Asia grew over 20%
16,We saw growth in most verticals led by semiconductor
17,"Most countries in the region were up including China, which grew about 20%"
18,Latin America grew 12% with strong growth in Mexico
19,I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter
20,Acquisitions add 1.2 points of sales growth
21,"ACP and MAVERICK are contributing technology innovation and domain expertise, and are accretive to earnings"
22,Our process business improved and was up 8% year-over-year organically
23,"Including MAVERICK, process was up double-digits"
24,Architecture & Software had another strong quarter with 10.5% organic growth
25,"Within this segment, Logix was up 10% compared to last year"
26,This was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth
27,Patrick will elaborate on Q3 financial performance in his remarks
28,We are pleased with our sales and earnings performance in the quarter
29,Let's move on to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2017.
30,"As I said earlier, the macro outlook remains solid"
31,Recent projections of industrial production growth are largely unchanged from a quarter ago
32,We expect continued growth in transportation and consumer
33,"We expect heavy industry in total to be up low single-digits for the year, consistent with our April guidance"
34,We are still not counting on growth from oil and gas and mining for full year fiscal 2017.
35,"Turning to guidance, considering the macro outlook and our results through three quarters, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 organic sales growth of approximately 6%"
36,"We now project fiscal 2017 sales of approximately $6.3 billion, slightly higher than prior guidance due to currency"
37,"Based on our third quarter earnings performance, we are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range"
38,The new range is $6.60 to $6.80.
39,"At the midpoint, this represents 13% adjusted EPS growth for the year"
40,Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks
41,"Before I turn it back over to Patrick, let me add a few comments"
42,Our Connected Enterprise strategy is working and positions us well for the future
43,"The pilots continued to deliver tangible results across multiple industries, and we are seeing customers expand pilots to more lines and facilities"
44,"We will remain focused as a single integrated business, helping our customers succeed in the global market by enabling them to be more productive and therefore, more competitive"
45,Our extent of industry knowledge and domain expertise help us deliver value based on each customer's needs
46,I want to highlight a couple of items
47,"First, an important announcement we made in June"
48,"We will be working in partnership with ManpowerGroup to upskill military veterans, investing in the future workforce and creating a pool of certified talent for in-demand advanced manufacturing roles across the United States"
49,"According to a recent survey, most U.S"
50,"employers think automation will increase, not decrease, manufacturing head count, but at a higher skill level"
51,"No matter how much you automate, people remain our and our customers' most important asset"
52,"Second, I'd like to remind you that Automation Fair is in Houston this year, and we'll be holding our Investor Meeting on Thursday, November 16."
53,"Although Automation Fair is a customer event, it's a great opportunity for investors and analysts to deepen their understanding of automation and learn more about our capabilities as well as those of our partners"
54,We will show how we are bringing the Connected Enterprise to life and delivering more value than ever before to our customers around the world
55,"So please mark your calendars, and we hope to see you all there"
56,"Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment to serving our customers"
57,"With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick"
58,Patrick?
59,Yeah
60,I think what we are seeing in a positive sense is diversification
61,"So we haven't talked as much about semiconductor in the past, but that was significant"
62,And that also is a big part of the automation market and metals has actually been positive for us in China
63,"We still look at China as fundamentally a two-speed economy where consumer, transportation, life sciences are growing faster in general, but some of the areas of heavy industries other than oil and gas are picking up"
64,"No, is the short answer"
65,"I mean, at mid-single digits growth in fiscal year 2018, that would â€“ the return to incentive comp would cease to be a headwind to us in the fiscal year"
66,"Regarding whether we're hiring or not, we are but we're balancing"
67,"So, my staff is looking for areas that bring us additional growth, but also looking at areas that aren't as important anymore"
68,"And so while the net increase is not large, we're constantly dynamically rebalancing where we need people, whether it's customer-facing employees, whether it's software developers"
69,"And so we are in the market and actively hiring, but we're also balancing to make sure that we don't create additional headwinds"
70,That's right
71,"Thank you, John"
72,It really is in the run rate
73,"And as I mentioned before, as we're hiring people, we're prioritizing"
74,So there's always a longer list of developments whether it's building out that information platform
75,or it's our core developments in Logix and our intelligent motor control platform
76,There's always going to be a longer list than we're going to get to in terms of development
77,So we're asking our teams to prioritize
78,"There is additional spend that's going to the information side, including the cloud but not just that"
79,"And as we talked about in the past, there's going to be a mix of organic development"
80,It's a focus area for acquisitions and also leveraging the technology from our partners to make sure that that development burden on Rockwell doesn't become oversized
81,"Good morning, Rick"
82,"I'll make some comments, and then Patrick will follow up with some additional color"
83,"One of the things that we're particularly proud of with auto, which is over 20% in the quarter, is the diversity of where that's coming from"
84,So powertrain is actually performing a little bit better than our expectations
85,"EV, so electric vehicle around the world is a material contributor including in Asia"
86,And so those are very encouraging to us
87,"In terms of traditional internal combustion automotive, that's fairly well balanced around the world, and it's a mix of the brand owners seeking to expand into new geographies, as well as the more frequent model changeovers that we've talked about in the past"
88,And so that diversity has contributed significantly to our growth year-to-date
89,I don't think we can really attribute that growth to that specific brand owner
90,"What we're seeing is a lot of activity at the tier suppliers for EV around the world, not just for Tesla"
91,And so it's broad-based
92,"There's a lot of new companies seeking to participate in that business, and we're serving a lot of them"
93,"So, I would not attribute it exclusively to the model rebuild now"
94,"Rick, you're looking year-over-year?"
95,Or you're looking sequentially?
96,"We've talked before about a relatively good visibility on automotive programs that goes out for a period of years and confirming the intention of continuing to spend on those programs with the brand owners, with the tier suppliers"
97,We see that as continued strong for the foreseeable future
98,"So certainly through the end of the year, but also beyond"
99,"And, again, the spend with us is primarily on some of the items that I mentioned before about model changes and expansion geographically"
100,"Over time, a reduced SAAR is going to impact us, but we continue to see strong revenue for the foreseeable future"
101,The other thing I mentioned about the U.S
102,market is that's been a particularly a fertile ground for us in the information and Connected Enterprise pilots
103,"So a lot of these brand owners are already using our smart products, our Logix and so on, but they're adding the information on top in some of the associated services"
104,So that's additional customer share that we're seeing even in existing operation
105,"So even when they're not going through a model change or capacity expansion as they seek to get better visibility into their production, reducing unplanned downtime, and some of the other key drivers of that new value"
106,"Well, without guiding to fiscal year 2018 organic growth"
107,The macroeconomic indicators are solid
108,So PMI continued strong in most spots around the world
109,"Industrial production continue, so largely unchanged from the last quarter"
110,So we do feel like we're in a period of expansion
111,I don't know that we've modeled the mix between the various transitions
112,There's some puts and takes in terms of the different parts of the assembly in powertrain process
113,"Some require a little more automation, some a little less"
114,I think the biggest single factor is expansion to new customers
115,"So capitalizing on some of the openings we have within the brand owners, continued coverage in the tier suppliers around the world, release of new products that makes a difference, continuing to add value to our partnership with FANUC and others"
116,I think those will have a bigger impact on our revenue growth than the pure split of automation content between EV and IC assembly
117,Both customer share and the acquisition of new customers
118,Good morning
119,"I think there's a little bit of movement between the different OEMs, for instance, in Europe"
120,We continue to see very good adoption and good growth in our CompactLogix platform at a broad range of OEMs.
121,The variability was really customer-specific
122,Some of our traditional customers may have purchased a little bit less in the quarter while we're building at some of the newer machinery builders
123,So that's really the majority of the variability
124,Good morning
125,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
126,LLC Morning
127,Just a first question on A&S globally
128,You saw the organic sales growth
129,"It was very good again in Q3, a little bit slower than Q2 off a tougher comp a year ago"
130,"So when you're looking at revenue growth outlook in that segment, should we expect that just to drift off as your comps get a lot tougher into the calendar fourth quarter and just looking out over six months, or is there any actual improvement in real end demand going on, or is end demand all-in pretty stable"
131,and it's just a function of comps driving your growth rate now?
132,Yeah
133,I would also say we do feel confident that we're gaining share in core platforms
134,"So at the growth we're seeing and comparing it against what external measures are available, we think we're taking share in A&S products"
135,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
136,LLC Thank you
137,"And looking at your sort of fourth quarter, should we expect that CP&S can hold the organic growth rate it saw in Q3 at about 6%?"
138,We're in an intensively competitive market
139,"I think we're guiding to a little less than a point of price because we're an asset light business, and mainly trade on intellectual capital, cost headwinds are not a significant new headwind for us"
140,Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
141,LLC Understood
142,Good morning
143,We also continue to see growth in the emerging parts of Europe
144,Yeah
145,"So first of all, semiconductor and electronic manufacturing and assembly are roughly 5% of our sales"
146,"And as you pointed out, they are in a period of investment"
147,"That's the chip production, that's the glass panel fabs"
148,We have a particular strength in the facility management control system
149,So the environmental controls that are so important to those kinds of advanced manufacturing processes are an area that we're quite strong in
150,"Characterized growth centered in Asia, in the U.S"
151,"especially, and they are in a period of good spend that's predicted to continue for a while, but there will be a certain cyclical element of that"
152,"One of the things that contributes to the growth as well is for a lot of that business, it involves value add as well"
153,"So engineering services, panel fabrication"
154,"So it's not just the loose products, but it's also the value add that increases the value of those sales"
155,Good morning
156,Yeah
157,It's still variable around the world
158,"So we mentioned last quarter that we are seeing a bit of a improvement in mining in Asia, for instance, but we're not ready to call it broad-based around the world"
159,"We still see pressure from lower commodity prices like copper still below $3 a pound, and we're still dealing with overcapacity in steel, that's putting pressure on that"
160,"That being said, we've got some bright spots"
161,"So metals has been relatively strong as customers modernize and, in some cases, consolidate facilities but adding automation"
162,"In North America, the lower cost of feedstock in natural gas is giving us good growth in chemical"
163,So it's spotty around the world
164,"We're not ready to call a general recovery, but there are spots that have contributed to that relatively improved performance in solutions and services"
165,I think it's both
166,I mentioned before the chemical market
167,"Certainly, the continued evolution of our PlantPAx control platform has helped"
168,It's going to continue to help
169,We've got a lot of developments lined up over the next few years that are going to increase our competitiveness there
170,But at least is important is the domain expertise
171,"So we're better able to serve, for instance, the chemical market because of the MAVERICK acquisition"
172,And that domain expertise is absolutely critical to foster the trust in those customers that we know how to address their mission critical applications
173,"So I'd really say it's a mix of our improved ability to serve the market, as well as a recovery in some areas and some diversification in terms of our ability to address additional process control applications"
174,Good morning
175,Happy to do that
176,"As we've talked about, we're very pleased with the evolution of these pilots"
177,We have a couple dozen that we're formally tracking across different industries and different parts of the world
178,"We've made some public announcements about a few of those, Metso, in the mining world as we partner with them, in conjunction with Microsoft, to be able to enhance their ability to add value to end user customers in areas like remote monitoring"
179,"Great Lakes Brewing, craft brewery located in Cleveland, is using some of our device-level analytics and some of our reporting tools to get better production visibility"
180,"Again, that's one that we're working with Microsoft to deliver that value for them"
181,It's a great story
182,"It's giving value to that individual customer, but it's also something that will, no doubt, expand to other similar operations"
183,"It's an easy way to get started and to get the value from the Connected Enterprise, from that integrated control and information without having to send all the data to the cloud in a very expensive and high-risk type of application"
184,"In oil and gas, we've talked about companies like Shell in the past that continue to expand their use of our information solutions and connected services"
185,"So really across industries and across geographies, we're happy with the evolution"
186,"In terms of quantifying the specific value, we think it's contributing to our very strong product growth as customers put that foundation in place"
187,That's where the data comes from
188,"But also we still believe that we're on track to deliver double-digit growth from some of the areas of new value in the Connected Enterprise, the information solutions, and the connected services that customers turn to as they try to integrate that control and information"
189,"Thanks, Justin"
190,Yeah
191,And so the ones we typically talk about and we've talking about together over the last couple of quarters has been oil and gas and then a broad-based mining recovery
192,"And going back a few years, we were used to outsize growth in those areas"
193,"And even though we did see low single-digit growth in mining and oil and gas in the quarter, we're not ready to call a general inflection point across the world"
194,"Well, I agree"
195,It is remarkable
196,It's a source of traditional strength for the company
197,"A lot of that growth has been centered recently in Mexico as Brazil and Venezuela, among others, deal with continuing political uncertainty"
198,And we enjoy in Mexico and in some countries diverse space
199,"So it's not just the heavy industry, but it's automotive, it's food/beverage, tire manufacturers are locating in Latin America"
200,So those would be a few additional comments about that growth
201,But it's a source of pride for us
202,So we have that relatively strong share in Latin America
203,Sure
204,"Well, just to reiterate, when we look at acquisitions, we look at their ability to accelerate our technology innovation, our domain expertise and/or our market access"
205,And the best ones bring us benefits in multiple of those dimensions
206,"On the technology side, information solutions is a particularly interesting area for us"
207,"In domain expertise, process continues to be an important opportunity for us"
208,"And then market access, as you would expect in some places, Asia, Europe where we have lower relative share, there are opportunities there as well"
209,"We're looking at our acquisition pipeline which is robust, first, in terms of the strategic fit in those dimensions, and we're satisfied and optimistic that what we've talked about before as our ability to grow on top line, have accretive acquisitions, but most importantly have them contribute to the strategy in areas like information management, analytics and so on"
