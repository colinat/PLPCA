0,Good morning
1,And thanks to everyone for calling in today
2,It looks like we got a pretty good crowd here calling in now
3,"Today, as always, I'll start off with comments about our consistent strategy"
4,I then like to give some color on both our military business and a few other topics relating to Q1.
5,I'll then summarize the Q1 performance and an update on the guidance
6,"Kevin will then go through some of the operating specifics for Q1, and Terry will run through the financials"
7,"To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both net consistently and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle"
8,"About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and about three quarters of our sales come from products, for which we believe we are the sole source provider"
9,Over half our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales
10,Aftermarket sales have historically produced higher margins and provided relative stability through the cycles
11,"Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders over time, private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market"
12,"To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet"
13,We follow a consistent long-term policy
14,"First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses, with significant aftermarket content"
15,"We have a simple, well proven value-based operating strategy, based around our three value-driver concepts"
16,"Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that's closely aligned with our shareholders"
17,"Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to private equity like returns"
18,"And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value"
19,"As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation"
20,"To remind you, we basically have four and our priorities typically are as follows"
21,Our first choice is always to invest in our existing business and our second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy
22,These are almost always our first two choices
23,"Our third choice is to give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or stock buybacks"
24,And our fourth is to pay off debt
25,"Given the low cost of debt especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in current market conditions"
26,"Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner, we think, has the best chance to maximize returns to the shareholders"
27,Now to update you on a few items of significance from the first quarter
28,"Because we've gotten a number of questions recently, I'd like to give you a little color on our military business"
29,"In fiscal year 2016, military revenues made up 30% of our reported sales, a relatively small portion of this was sold directly to the U.S"
30,government
31,"I'll break the 30% down a little, based on our best estimates of the 2016 reported revenues"
32,About 12% of our total revenues were sold to the domestic defense OEMs.
33,This is a mix of sales primarily for both new airplane build and aftermarket sales
34,"These are companies like, Lockheed, Boeing, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, UTC, et cetera"
35,About 6% of our total sales were sold to foreign defense OEMs.
36,This is also a mix of sales for both new airplane builds and some aftermarket
37,"These are companies like, Airbus Defence, Dassault, Saab, Leonardo-Finmeccanica, et cetera"
38,About 5% of our total revenues are sold to friendly foreign governments either directly or through broker distributors
39,These are generally users of U.S
40,"equipment, some examples include UK, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Denmark, just to name a few"
41,About 5% of our total revenue or about $150 million is sold directly to the U.S
42,"Government through various agencies, the largest direct supplier by a significant amount is the Airborne military parachute business that we acquired in late 2013."
43,About another 2% of our total revenue or somewhere around $60 million is sold to the U.S
44,Government through various brokers or distributors
45,This is spread over many of our operating businesses and a number of brokers and distributors
46,A substantial part of this revenue is sold to small disadvantage and/or women-owned brokers or distributors in response to government buys directed to the small businesses
47,We do not own a whole or in part any broker distributor
48,Our only relationship is as a supplier
49,We've also added a number of questions about the impact of potential income tax law changes
50,"We, of course, have no idea what if any tax changes may ultimately come to fruition"
51,"As I'm sure you all know, the rumors change regularly"
52,"However, based on estimates of both the so-called House and Trump plan, it appears to us that for our 2016 reported income tax, our income tax would be no higher and would likely be a bit lower under either plan, and Terry will give you a little more detail on this"
53,"In any event, at least as we understand the various tax proposals today, I think it's very unlikely that any of these changes would materially impact either our business or our capital allocation strategies"
54,"This quarter, we were pretty active in the capital markets"
55,"In Q1, we raised about $1.2 billion of debt to both partially fund the special dividend and also to refinance some of our existing debt"
56,We paid out a $1.4 billion special dividend for $24 per share to our shareholders
57,We also plan to take advantage of a continuing strong credit market in early Q2 to refinance about $1.2 billion of our term loans
58,Our debt was trading a little over par
59,"The purpose was to slightly reduce interest rates and, also, to extend the maturity"
60,We did not intend to raise any new money at that time
61,"When the stock dropped 10% on Friday, January 20, the debt traded down to par or slightly below"
62,"As a result, the expense to do the refi didn't make any sense with no interest rate savings; so, we put the deal on hold and will review the status regularly"
63,"Access to the market was not, and has never been, an issue"
64,We simply just didn't see any savings and it wasn't worth the expense
65,"As we've explained in the past, about 75% of our debt is either fixed or capped"
66,"The net result is to significantly reduce our exposure to interest rate movements through 2020, at least"
67,"Terry, again, will give you a little more detail on this"
68,"We bought about $150 million of our stock back after the drop in price on January 20, at an average price of about $225 a share"
69,"Since we were in a blackout period, we were limited to this $150 million by the 10b5 plan we had in place"
70,"On December 31, 2016, that's the end of the quarter, our liquidity was strong"
71,"We had slightly under $1 billion in cash, about $600 million of open revolver, and additional room under our credit agreement"
72,We believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions at this time
73,This grows steadily through the year
74,This does not imply anything about likely levels of acquisitions
75,We also announced two new key management changes in the first quarter
76,Kevin Stein was named President and Chief Operating Officer
77,Kevin is now responsible for most of our operating businesses
78,Bob Henderson was named Vice Chairman
79,"Bob continues to be responsible for select businesses, but is also working with Bernie and I on business development and other issues"
80,Our acquisition efforts remain active
81,"The pipeline is, as usual, mostly small and mid-sized businesses, and closings are always difficult to predict"
82,"Now, Kevin's going to review a little detail on Q1 operating performance"
83,"But just to give a few comments, first, keep in mind, as you look at the Q1 versus the prior year Q1 comps, there are about 3% less shipping days in this year's Q1 versus the last"
84,"Though it's hard to exactly quantify the impact, this likely impacts our commercial aftermarket revenue comps more than other sectors"
85,"In total, Q1 organic revenue was up 3.5% versus the prior year Q1, roughly in line with our full-year guidance"
86,The commercial OEM revenues were a little soft
87,Commercial transport revenues were down modestly
88,Business jet revenues were down more significantly
89,"Bookings were up year-over-year in the commercial transport sector; were, again, soft in the business jet market"
90,"Commercial aftermarket revenue was up modestly versus the prior year Q1; however, on a very positive note, commercial aftermarket bookings or incoming orders were very strong"
91,Bookings were also up significant sequentially and ran well ahead of the Q1 shipments
92,This is a good sign for the balance of the year
93,The defense revenues were up about 2.5% versus the prior year Q1.
94,"Bookings were down, but this appears to be timing"
95,"Operating margins were strong and up versus the prior year, and we continue to execute on our steady value creation process"
96,"Based on the Q1 full year results, our 2017 guidance, assuming no acquisitions or additional capital market activity in the fiscal year, is adjusted as follows"
97,The midpoint of the fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance is now $3.55 billion
98,This is a slight increase of about $5 million versus the previous guidance
99,The midpoint of the fiscal year 2017 EBITDA
100,"As Defined guidance is now about $1.7 billion, an increase of $15 million from our previous guidance"
101,This increase in guidance is due to the slight increase in revenue and a modest upward adjustment in our EBITDA margins
102,"The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $12.16 a share, up $0.18 from our previous guidance"
103,This increase in guidance is also primarily due to the same reasons as the EBITDA: slight increase in revenue and a modest margin improvement
104,Terry will go through that in a little more detail
105,"On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is still based on the following growth rate assumptions"
106,These are unchanged from our original guidance
107,Commercial aftermarket growth in the mid to high single digits; the strong bookings here are very encouraging
108,"Defense and military revenue, flat to slightly up versus the prior year as a percent"
109,Commercial OEM revenue growth in the low to mid single digit percent range
110,We're still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single-digit percents for 2018.
111,We remain cautious about 2018 rates
112,Business jet shipments and bookings bear watching
113,We have significant cash and available borrowing
114,"These continue to grow through the year, and Terry will expand on that"
115,"In summary, Q1 was a good solid start to the year"
116,"And now, Kevin?"
117,"The truth of the matter is, Carter, I don't know"
118,The good news is it's not a very big part of our business
119,I look at all the â€
120,"“ everything in the press, and I look at everybody"
121,I look at the earnings releases and the statements by the business jet manufacturers
122,It's hard to get a lot of confidence in that
123,"We think, at least last year, it was down fairly substantially, and it's starting off this year down some"
124,"There is obviously some inventory draw going on there, but I am reticent to forecast when that ends"
125,I have to admit we have been singularly unsuccessful in calling a turn in this for the last three or four years
126,I'm not confident
127,I don't remember the answer to that
128,We have the numbers here
129,Was Q1 down versus Q4?
130,"You'll always â€“ frequently, you'll be down â€"
131,"“ you got the day issue between four and one, so you'll always be down some"
132,"Yeah, it's like 2 on 61 or something; 2 on 61 and 2 on 63."
133,And the weight is up â€
134,"“ if you weight it by operating unit, you'd get about the same number"
135,"At some point, yeah"
136,"But Carter, I don't know what the exact quarter-per-quarter count is in each quarter going forward"
137,"But as I said, it's hard to exactly pin that to what it exactly did in the quarter"
138,"But I would say it is more likely to impact the commercial aftermarket where the turns are faster, plus"
139,"frankly, you have some buffer in distribution"
140,Yeah
141,We haven't made any conscious decision to move more aggressively into the defense world
142,That's just what we saw
143,We go through the same process
144,We go through â€
145,“ we forecast
146,We try to see what we can do with the margins
147,We assume the capital structure just like a PE kind of buy
148,I would describe it â€
149,“ it's just the way we (37:03) over that period
150,It's not a conscious attempt to change the defense content
151,"Yeah, I can't really talk about things in our business"
152,"that went past the quarter, but I would say, as Kevin and I â€"
153,“ Kevin pointed out numerically
154,"and I talked about it directionally, the bookings â€"
155,"“ the commercial aftermarket bookings are up substantially, both sequentially they ran above the shipments and up year-over-year; and, I suspect that's reflective of some of that"
156,Good morning
157,"Yeah, I would say that the quarterly days for the balance of the year comp the other, I just â€"
158,"“ I'm sure if you counted them, Rob, that's probably right"
159,I just don't know the answer to that
160,"I'd say, the main thing that gives me comfort, one"
161,", it's not unusual to start off a little slow in the first quarter"
162,But I mostly take comfort from that the bookings are so strong
163,"The bookings are up very substantially, and that's what gives me the best comfort"
164,"Yeah, I don't know that that's an exact cutoff"
165,But that's â€
166,"“ I think, three or four months is probably a reasonable number"
167,"So, if your question is, do I know what's going to ship in the fourth quarter?"
168,I do not
169,I don't â€
170,"“ we don't have the backlog, yet"
171,"But if I look at the metrics we see, which is air travel, which is we don't see distributor inventories out of whack"
172,â€
173,“ that's not to say there couldn't still be some at airlines; we don't see it at distributors
174,And we see the incoming bookings in coming quite strong; that gives us the comfort
175,"Obviously, we don't know, yet"
176,Pipeline is decent
177,Pipeline is decent
178,"I mean, I think pretty good"
179,It is â€
180,“ it â€
181,"“ as usual, it â€“ usually, it's small and midsize stuff"
182,"We'd always like bigger things, within reason"
183,"We don't want them too big, because we don't want to place all our chips on one bet"
184,"But I would say it's reasonably active, Rob; reasonably active if I look at it versus other time frames"
185,"I don't think the pricing has changed, at least â€"
186,"“ the next thing that closes, of course, I don't know what the price will be"
187,But I don't see any indication that the pricing has changed
188,It's â€
189,“ good proprietary sole source stuff with a decent amount of aftermarket is pricing
190,We did not forecast any significant growth in that in our base forecast
191,I don't remember whether it was a little lower or not
192,But it wasn't a significant â€
193,“ it wasn't significantly up or significantly down
194,"I just don't remember whether it was zero or minus 1, or something like that"
195,We weren't figuring on anything here in the business jet world
196,"Well, I think we told you, right â€"
197,"“ oh, I see, you're trying to pull them out, right?"
198,You're trying to pull them out
199,"I mean, you could probably look at it â€"
200,"“ I'd probably figure, commercial transport's probably 85% of the volume"
201,"And figure there, business jet is maybe zero, 1, maybe down 1 or 2 on the low side, up 1 or 2 on the high side, somewhere around zero, when you kind of back into it"
202,"I don't know the exact number there, and one of the reasons I don't know the exact number is it's sometimes a little informal rather than â€"
203,"“ the bigger the order gets, the more informal that gets"
204,"And the smaller ones are a little more informal, but I would guess, I would guess, if you took all of our sales to the military â€“ to the U.S"
205,"military, direct them to the brokers, I think you're probably in the 20% to 30% range, could be a little plus or minus on that"
206,Good morning
207,I know â€
208,“ the answer is
209,"I don't exactly know that answer, Noah, but"
210,I do not believe there's any substantial difference
211,"I mean, we essentially sell for the same price usually, in the vast majority of the cases"
212,"So, I"
213,(44:46)
214,The â€
215,“ I'm not â€
216,"“ the answer, as I said here is that I don't know that"
217,Let me take a look
218,I'm going to look now at our magic cheat sheet here
219,"And can you â€“ can you give that number, Kevin?"
220,Yeah
221,(45:21)
222,"Yeah, about 12%"
223,"In other words, if you â€“ if you ship the $100, we book $112."
224,No
225,No
226,I don't â€
227,"“ no, if you hypothesize that interest rates went up to 20%, I might answer that differently"
228,"But anything â€“ any realistic range or rates that I see, I do not â€"
229,“ I don't see that changing anything we do
230,I don't see anything that we've seen talked about here that would change our fundamental business or capital market strategy
231,That's right
232,"And â€“ or conversely â€“ or another way, not conversely, but another way of putting that is if we used it to buy stock or pay out dividends, I would look at it as the cost of our equity is 15% to 20%"
233,"And that's after tax, and there's almost no interest rate I can think of that would make that a bad swap"
234,Good morning
235,"Yeah, on the â€“ what do we do if we have $1.5 billion or $1.4 billion at the end of the year, I really don't want to speculate on that"
236,"I mean that's a long way off, we'll do what we always do, we'll look at our borrowing capacity, and we'll look at the backlog at deals, and we'll look at the credit market and the equity market, and we'll decide what to do with it"
237,"I mean, basically our choices are, right, hold it for some future acquisitions that we haven't seen yet, maybe, or start to pay back out to the shareholders"
238,I mean that's pretty much what we always do
239,"And as I sit here today, I just â€"
240,"“ I don't have to speculate on where we go, other than I think you can â€"
241,"“ I think you know pretty well how we think about this, and I don't see any change in our â€“ in the way we look at it"
242,And what was your other question?
243,I don't think so
244,"I mean, as you know, this is a big market"
245,There's lots of companies out there
246,"The problem, it's not identifying companies we like, it's finding ones that are willing to sell, and that's just a continual sort of churning and then beating the bushes effort"
247,"Well, I'm going to â€"
248,“ I'm going to pass to Terry on the pro forma versus the GAAP growth because I'm not sure I'd understand that if I use same-store
249,(49:35)
250,the way I always look at it
251,That was GAAP
252,"I mean, simplistically, the GAAP number only reflects the portion of the year that you own the business"
253,The pro forma number assumes we own the business as the whole year
254,I don't know the answer
255,"You mean, what is the growth?"
256,It's a reflection of our shipset content
257,"I mean, ROE forecast is pretty simple"
258,"I mean, we know our shipset content"
259,We know the production rates for 2017.
260,There's a little bit of an estimate because you don't know what's â€
261,"“ if there's a cut in 2018, it could start to ripple back in to 2017 and you have little bit of guess where there is going to any inventory movement"
262,"But I mean, our shipset content hasn't changed"
263,"The production rates, we think, we were conservative going into the year, we still think we're conservative"
264,"David, I don't think it's materially different"
265,I'd use roughly the same percent
266,"Well, if you're not already in this business, it's just tough to get in"
267,"As you know, it's a pretty long gestation period to get into this"
268,"And product per product, they're pretty small market segments"
269,"So I think you know developed from scratch, it's relatively almost very small risk"
270,"I mean the other is, do you mean in the M&A world?"
271,In the M&A world these â€
272,“ they tend to be smaller businesses
273,"So one by one they get, where I'd mostly think of is PE, they tend to be small so that they're not as exciting for the other bigger PE firms or even the mid-size ones when they first come up"
274,"Frankly, it's tough to compete against us"
275,"If you're a PE firm that is looking in a proprietary aerospace business and you're outbidding us, you got to be pretty worried, right, because the only way you're going to do that is to be making a higher bet on the margin improvement"
276,"And the other thing is a couple have started it and frankly, we bought them"
277,Odyssey started a roll up and we bought it
278,"McKechnie, JLL started a roll up and we bought it with McKechnie"
279,"I don't think there is â€“ as I said, I don't know the exact number on the provisioning"
280,but I do not think it's very significant
281,We didn't see much for the Boeing 787
282,and I don't believe there's much to it there
283,"I think if you look at the details, it's a pretty broad based booking pick-up across the vast majority of our businesses"
284,Morning
285,"I mean, that's the total average"
286,"I don't think the military is way off of that, I don't have the exact number here"
287,"Actually, excuse me, it's a little higher"
288,"It's more like 60%, 30% or 65%, 35%"
289,"So, everybody is waving their hands at me"
290,Okay
291,So still 55% like I thought
292,"When I said 55%, Ken, the whole place started to waving their arms"
293,No
294,"Rough 55%, 45% just like the overall business"
295,"First, just I'm not sure I got the question right"
296,But just the numbers Kevin gave they were like-like same-store
297,They were organic growth
298,It's not â€
299,“ the 787 content didn't go up because we bought the content
300,"We compared it before and after with the same mix of businesses, so if you follow"
301,So it's like-like same-store
302,Why does it go up?
303,Because I think we do a good job
304,I think we service the account
305,We're all over the engineering department
306,"I think we are reliable deliverers, the stuff works and we chase it pretty aggressively"
307,Sort of the same reason you sell anything
308,I think the â€
309,"“ you're asking me how much is pricing, how much is units, I think?"
310,I don't know the answer to that
311,I can tell you it's not a whole lot of price because it's tough to get price at the OEM
312,"I mean, it's some, but it's not a whole lot"
313,"So presumptively, that means there's some share gains, but I have to admit I don't know what the number is"
314,"Well, yeah,"
315,"nothing changed with my contracts, as you may or may not know"
316,"My contract presently runs through 2019, and my contract presently anticipates that, at some point, I could become an Executive Chairman"
317,"I think we changed it because Kevin became President and CEO here, as you know, and I think it more likely fits with our current thinking, though it mostly just gives us more optionality"
318,I don't think so
319,There's nothing that I could really point out that I have any confidence in in that
320,"And I just want to be sure, I'm not â€"
321,"“ we're saying, we feel comfortable now with our forecast, our guidance for the year, which is the same as we started the year off with"
322,"So, we're not suggesting it looks far more bullish, just the strong bookings give us additional confidence"
323,I think we're mixing questions
324,We're mixing questions
325,If you compare the bookings
326,"So, let me say it in case"
327,I got them mixed up
328,"If you look at the bookings this quarter against the bookings last quarter, in the commercial transport and aftermarket, they're up about 12%"
329,"Just coincidently, coincidently, if you look at the bookings this quarter against the shipments this quarter, they also are up somewhere around 12%"
330,"So, it's to say coincidently around the same number, which may be a little confusing"
331,Okay
332,Let's see
333,Let me answer that in a couple of ways
334,"I could say, in total â€"
335,"“ that's not to say it couldn't be account by account, but when you roll the thing up in total, the pricing dynamics and the pricing numbers have not changed substantively for a number of years"
336,It's still roughly we get the same answer
337,"Maybe one unit this year is a little better than another one, but they all tend to put and take and weight up to about the same number, which is one we track very closely"
338,The other question was the distributor versus direct?
339,"In the military, we sell to the distributors and brokers where they get the same price"
340,There is no difference there
341,"In the commercial, I'm not sure of the answer to that"
342,I think it's pretty â€
343,“ I don't think there's a material difference
344,"Well, I think, as you know, we sort of preemptively adjusted the head count about a year ago"
345,"I think we may have moved it down a little this quarter, but not by â€"
346,"“ Kevin, is that right?"
347,I think it was down a little
348,"But not on across the board, just units adjusted as it looked to them"
349,like they were a little softer or not a little softer
350,"I think, right now â€“ and this is mostly around the commercial transport cycle and"
351,"when it might start to soften up, I think, right now, we think we've made about what adjustments we think are appropriate, but we'll keep watching it"
352,"Our concern is, how long does the commercial transport OEM cycle hold up"
353,When does it start to soften?
354,"And when it does, how does that reflect back into this year?"
355,"So far, we see no indication and we think, frankly, the numbers we used, which we think are still conservative"
356,"Hi, and welcome,"
357,welcome
358,"I mean, it's essentially â€"
359,“ it's not consistent across deals
360,"I mean, it's essentially, we get the margin improvement essentially three ways: some price adjustment; some cost adjustment;"
361,"and, hopefully, if we bought in to something that's growing, we get a little bit of operating leverage by the business growing"
362,"If not, the other way we can get it is by looking at the product lines and seeing if we want the profitable ones and the unprofitable ones"
363,"But the vast majority of it typically comes from natural market growth, price adjustment and cost adjustment"
364,"Yeah, we'll decide that â€"
365,“ the capital allocation is something we'll decide based on how things look when it comes time to make that decision
366,"I'd say the buy through the quarter, frankly, we would have bought more, but we were stuck with the 10b5 plan that, essentially, you have to put it on automatic pilot"
367,And it was on automatic pilot when we made the buys and at what amount we could buy
368,"If we had it to reset, we frankly would have put more"
369,â€
370,“ we would have set more in it
371,"Oh, yeah, ramp-up in readiness spending is good"
372,"At this point, I'd be very cautious about predicting any significant change in this year"
373,They got to get the budget
374,"They got to place the orders, then it takes a while to ship it"
375,"It's always hard to guess when the military starts to buy, but I'm being reticent"
376,"In the near term, which I'd define as this year, I'd be cautious about assuming any significant change just because of the inertia and time lag"
377,"I would think so, readiness is a â€"
378,"“ typically readiness means buy more repair parts, buy more services, buy more repairs, all that sort of thing, which is generally good for us"
379,Yeah
380,"Yeah, I can't â€"
381,"“ I mean, obviously, I can't â€"
382,“ I don't know what somebody might do in the fullness of time
383,I can say it's a long effort if it was to happen
384,and we haven't seen it
385,"And at least typically with the OEMs, in our contracting basis that looks similar to what it has been in the past generally"
386,"But I mean, I just â€"
387,“ I don't know what someone might do
388,We have not seen it
389,I don't think the math works
390,"I think, it's unlikely"
391,but I can't be certain on that
392,"But I'll say again, I don't see it"
393,and I haven't seen any significant sign of it
394,I can't answer that generically
395,"I mean, that's very fact and circumstance specific"
396,"When I think if you particularly as we get bigger, this gets â€“ when you roll everything up, overall prices are pretty consistent â€"
397,"“ are consistently above inflation, not miles above or the bottom"
398,"And I think,"
399,"Terry, it's safe to say that when you did the calculation, you assume the reasonable deduct for that?"
400,"So, if you take the $1.1 billion, and what's the interest, it is about $580 million?"
401,Interest is about $580 million
402,"So, it's $580 million"
403,"If you take the $1.1 billion, and I'd also say depending on how they treat distributors, that could be higher"
404,You can deduct the fair amount from that and still be at above $580 million
405,It's a good platform
406,Top 15?
407,I don't want to answer that because I don't â€
408,“ I haven't done the math
409,"I don't know the answer, but it's a good platform"
410,"I would expect that someday, it would start to show up on our top 15 or 25, but I don't know when and haven't done the math on it"
411,"Well, we don't disclose the price"
412,"Look, we just don't disclose our price"
413,"As I told you, the prices â€"
414,“ the weighted up prices are higher than inflation
415,"We will think of inflation is 3%, but it's not miles higher"
416,"Well, you ought to think of us as we're â€"
417,"“ when you look at our aftermarket, the commercial aftermarket, which I presume, which you're mostly talking about, you can pretty well think of us as market weighted"
418,"So, different people have different definitions with legacy aircraft and what the retirement rates are, but you can almost think of us like the market"
419,That's about how we're weighted
420,"So, if you think 727s are going run off of at a certain rate, that's how we'll run off"
421,"Now, remember, we're interjecting new airplanes into the mix every year or two"
422,"So as that runs off, something else moves into that old window, as long as the shipset keeps going"
423,"But that's the best way to calibrate it, figure were about market weighted"
424,I'm not sure what it is
425,I'm not sure of your question
426,We're trying to get a very specific â€
427,“ the very specific thing we are communicating is the incoming orders or bookings are 12% higher than they were from the same quarter in the previous year
428,That's one
429,"Number two is, coincidently, the bookings in Q1 are also somewhere around 12% higher than the shipments or the revenues in Q1."
430,"Okay, and remind me if I got mixed up in what the pro forma you were talking about last"
