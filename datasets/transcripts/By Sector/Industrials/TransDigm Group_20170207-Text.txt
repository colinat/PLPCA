Good morning
And thanks to everyone for calling in today
It looks like we got a pretty good crowd here calling in now
Today, as always, I'll start off with comments about our consistent strategy
I then like to give some color on both our military business and a few other topics relating to Q1. I'll then summarize the Q1 performance and an update on the guidance
Kevin will then go through some of the operating specifics for Q1, and Terry will run through the financials
To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both net consistently and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle
About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and about three quarters of our sales come from products, for which we believe we are the sole source provider
Over half our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales
Aftermarket sales have historically produced higher margins and provided relative stability through the cycles
Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders over time, private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market
To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet
We follow a consistent long-term policy
First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses, with significant aftermarket content
We have a simple, well proven value-based operating strategy, based around our three value-driver concepts
Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that's closely aligned with our shareholders
Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to private equity like returns
And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation
To remind you, we basically have four and our priorities typically are as follows
Our first choice is always to invest in our existing business and our second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy
These are almost always our first two choices
Our third choice is to give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or stock buybacks
And our fourth is to pay off debt
Given the low cost of debt especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in current market conditions
Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner, we think, has the best chance to maximize returns to the shareholders
Now to update you on a few items of significance from the first quarter
Because we've gotten a number of questions recently, I'd like to give you a little color on our military business
In fiscal year 2016, military revenues made up 30% of our reported sales, a relatively small portion of this was sold directly to the U.S
government
I'll break the 30% down a little, based on our best estimates of the 2016 reported revenues
About 12% of our total revenues were sold to the domestic defense OEMs. This is a mix of sales primarily for both new airplane build and aftermarket sales
These are companies like, Lockheed, Boeing, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, UTC, et cetera
About 6% of our total sales were sold to foreign defense OEMs. This is also a mix of sales for both new airplane builds and some aftermarket
These are companies like, Airbus Defence, Dassault, Saab, Leonardo-Finmeccanica, et cetera
About 5% of our total revenues are sold to friendly foreign governments either directly or through broker distributors
These are generally users of U.S
equipment, some examples include UK, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Denmark, just to name a few
About 5% of our total revenue or about $150 million is sold directly to the U.S
Government through various agencies, the largest direct supplier by a significant amount is the Airborne military parachute business that we acquired in late 2013. About another 2% of our total revenue or somewhere around $60 million is sold to the U.S
Government through various brokers or distributors
This is spread over many of our operating businesses and a number of brokers and distributors
A substantial part of this revenue is sold to small disadvantage and/or women-owned brokers or distributors in response to government buys directed to the small businesses
We do not own a whole or in part any broker distributor
Our only relationship is as a supplier
We've also added a number of questions about the impact of potential income tax law changes
We, of course, have no idea what if any tax changes may ultimately come to fruition
As I'm sure you all know, the rumors change regularly
However, based on estimates of both the so-called House and Trump plan, it appears to us that for our 2016 reported income tax, our income tax would be no higher and would likely be a bit lower under either plan, and Terry will give you a little more detail on this
In any event, at least as we understand the various tax proposals today, I think it's very unlikely that any of these changes would materially impact either our business or our capital allocation strategies
This quarter, we were pretty active in the capital markets
In Q1, we raised about $1.2 billion of debt to both partially fund the special dividend and also to refinance some of our existing debt
We paid out a $1.4 billion special dividend for $24 per share to our shareholders
We also plan to take advantage of a continuing strong credit market in early Q2 to refinance about $1.2 billion of our term loans
Our debt was trading a little over par
The purpose was to slightly reduce interest rates and, also, to extend the maturity
We did not intend to raise any new money at that time
When the stock dropped 10% on Friday, January 20, the debt traded down to par or slightly below
As a result, the expense to do the refi didn't make any sense with no interest rate savings; so, we put the deal on hold and will review the status regularly
Access to the market was not, and has never been, an issue
We simply just didn't see any savings and it wasn't worth the expense
As we've explained in the past, about 75% of our debt is either fixed or capped
The net result is to significantly reduce our exposure to interest rate movements through 2020, at least
Terry, again, will give you a little more detail on this
We bought about $150 million of our stock back after the drop in price on January 20, at an average price of about $225 a share
Since we were in a blackout period, we were limited to this $150 million by the 10b5 plan we had in place
On December 31, 2016, that's the end of the quarter, our liquidity was strong
We had slightly under $1 billion in cash, about $600 million of open revolver, and additional room under our credit agreement
We believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions at this time
This grows steadily through the year
This does not imply anything about likely levels of acquisitions
We also announced two new key management changes in the first quarter
Kevin Stein was named President and Chief Operating Officer
Kevin is now responsible for most of our operating businesses
Bob Henderson was named Vice Chairman
Bob continues to be responsible for select businesses, but is also working with Bernie and I on business development and other issues
Our acquisition efforts remain active
The pipeline is, as usual, mostly small and mid-sized businesses, and closings are always difficult to predict
Now, Kevin's going to review a little detail on Q1 operating performance
But just to give a few comments, first, keep in mind, as you look at the Q1 versus the prior year Q1 comps, there are about 3% less shipping days in this year's Q1 versus the last
Though it's hard to exactly quantify the impact, this likely impacts our commercial aftermarket revenue comps more than other sectors
In total, Q1 organic revenue was up 3.5% versus the prior year Q1, roughly in line with our full-year guidance
The commercial OEM revenues were a little soft
Commercial transport revenues were down modestly
Business jet revenues were down more significantly
Bookings were up year-over-year in the commercial transport sector; were, again, soft in the business jet market
Commercial aftermarket revenue was up modestly versus the prior year Q1; however, on a very positive note, commercial aftermarket bookings or incoming orders were very strong
Bookings were also up significant sequentially and ran well ahead of the Q1 shipments
This is a good sign for the balance of the year
The defense revenues were up about 2.5% versus the prior year Q1. Bookings were down, but this appears to be timing
Operating margins were strong and up versus the prior year, and we continue to execute on our steady value creation process
Based on the Q1 full year results, our 2017 guidance, assuming no acquisitions or additional capital market activity in the fiscal year, is adjusted as follows
The midpoint of the fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance is now $3.55 billion
This is a slight increase of about $5 million versus the previous guidance
The midpoint of the fiscal year 2017 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now about $1.7 billion, an increase of $15 million from our previous guidance
This increase in guidance is due to the slight increase in revenue and a modest upward adjustment in our EBITDA margins
The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $12.16 a share, up $0.18 from our previous guidance
This increase in guidance is also primarily due to the same reasons as the EBITDA: slight increase in revenue and a modest margin improvement
Terry will go through that in a little more detail
On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is still based on the following growth rate assumptions
These are unchanged from our original guidance
Commercial aftermarket growth in the mid to high single digits; the strong bookings here are very encouraging
Defense and military revenue, flat to slightly up versus the prior year as a percent
Commercial OEM revenue growth in the low to mid single digit percent range
We're still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single-digit percents for 2018. We remain cautious about 2018 rates
Business jet shipments and bookings bear watching
We have significant cash and available borrowing
These continue to grow through the year, and Terry will expand on that
In summary, Q1 was a good solid start to the year
And now, Kevin?
The truth of the matter is, Carter, I don't know
The good news is it's not a very big part of our business
I look at all the – everything in the press, and I look at everybody
I look at the earnings releases and the statements by the business jet manufacturers
It's hard to get a lot of confidence in that
We think, at least last year, it was down fairly substantially, and it's starting off this year down some
There is obviously some inventory draw going on there, but I am reticent to forecast when that ends
I have to admit we have been singularly unsuccessful in calling a turn in this for the last three or four years
I'm not confident
I don't remember the answer to that
We have the numbers here
Was Q1 down versus Q4?
You'll always – frequently, you'll be down – you got the day issue between four and one, so you'll always be down some
Yeah, it's like 2 on 61 or something; 2 on 61 and 2 on 63.
And the weight is up – if you weight it by operating unit, you'd get about the same number
At some point, yeah
But Carter, I don't know what the exact quarter-per-quarter count is in each quarter going forward
But as I said, it's hard to exactly pin that to what it exactly did in the quarter
But I would say it is more likely to impact the commercial aftermarket where the turns are faster, plus frankly, you have some buffer in distribution
Yeah
We haven't made any conscious decision to move more aggressively into the defense world
That's just what we saw
We go through the same process
We go through – we forecast
We try to see what we can do with the margins
We assume the capital structure just like a PE kind of buy
I would describe it – it's just the way we (37:03) over that period
It's not a conscious attempt to change the defense content
Yeah, I can't really talk about things in our business that went past the quarter, but I would say, as Kevin and I – Kevin pointed out numerically and I talked about it directionally, the bookings – the commercial aftermarket bookings are up substantially, both sequentially they ran above the shipments and up year-over-year; and, I suspect that's reflective of some of that
Good morning
Yeah, I would say that the quarterly days for the balance of the year comp the other, I just – I'm sure if you counted them, Rob, that's probably right
I just don't know the answer to that
I'd say, the main thing that gives me comfort, one, it's not unusual to start off a little slow in the first quarter
But I mostly take comfort from that the bookings are so strong
The bookings are up very substantially, and that's what gives me the best comfort
Yeah, I don't know that that's an exact cutoff
But that's – I think, three or four months is probably a reasonable number
So, if your question is, do I know what's going to ship in the fourth quarter? I do not
I don't – we don't have the backlog, yet
But if I look at the metrics we see, which is air travel, which is we don't see distributor inventories out of whack – that's not to say there couldn't still be some at airlines; we don't see it at distributors
And we see the incoming bookings in coming quite strong; that gives us the comfort
Obviously, we don't know, yet
Pipeline is decent
Pipeline is decent
I mean, I think pretty good
It is – it – as usual, it – usually, it's small and midsize stuff
We'd always like bigger things, within reason
We don't want them too big, because we don't want to place all our chips on one bet
But I would say it's reasonably active, Rob; reasonably active if I look at it versus other time frames
I don't think the pricing has changed, at least – the next thing that closes, of course, I don't know what the price will be
But I don't see any indication that the pricing has changed
It's – good proprietary sole source stuff with a decent amount of aftermarket is pricing
We did not forecast any significant growth in that in our base forecast
I don't remember whether it was a little lower or not
But it wasn't a significant – it wasn't significantly up or significantly down
I just don't remember whether it was zero or minus 1, or something like that
We weren't figuring on anything here in the business jet world
Well, I think we told you, right – oh, I see, you're trying to pull them out, right?
You're trying to pull them out
I mean, you could probably look at it – I'd probably figure, commercial transport's probably 85% of the volume
And figure there, business jet is maybe zero, 1, maybe down 1 or 2 on the low side, up 1 or 2 on the high side, somewhere around zero, when you kind of back into it
I don't know the exact number there, and one of the reasons I don't know the exact number is it's sometimes a little informal rather than – the bigger the order gets, the more informal that gets
And the smaller ones are a little more informal, but I would guess, I would guess, if you took all of our sales to the military – to the U.S
military, direct them to the brokers, I think you're probably in the 20% to 30% range, could be a little plus or minus on that
Good morning
I know – the answer is I don't exactly know that answer, Noah, but I do not believe there's any substantial difference
I mean, we essentially sell for the same price usually, in the vast majority of the cases
So, I
(44:46)
The – I'm not – the answer, as I said here is that I don't know that
Let me take a look
I'm going to look now at our magic cheat sheet here
And can you – can you give that number, Kevin? Yeah
(45:21)
Yeah, about 12%
In other words, if you – if you ship the $100, we book $112.
No
No
I don't – no, if you hypothesize that interest rates went up to 20%, I might answer that differently
But anything – any realistic range or rates that I see, I do not – I don't see that changing anything we do
I don't see anything that we've seen talked about here that would change our fundamental business or capital market strategy
That's right
And – or conversely – or another way, not conversely, but another way of putting that is if we used it to buy stock or pay out dividends, I would look at it as the cost of our equity is 15% to 20%
And that's after tax, and there's almost no interest rate I can think of that would make that a bad swap
Good morning
Yeah, on the – what do we do if we have $1.5 billion or $1.4 billion at the end of the year, I really don't want to speculate on that
I mean that's a long way off, we'll do what we always do, we'll look at our borrowing capacity, and we'll look at the backlog at deals, and we'll look at the credit market and the equity market, and we'll decide what to do with it
I mean, basically our choices are, right, hold it for some future acquisitions that we haven't seen yet, maybe, or start to pay back out to the shareholders
I mean that's pretty much what we always do
And as I sit here today, I just – I don't have to speculate on where we go, other than I think you can – I think you know pretty well how we think about this, and I don't see any change in our – in the way we look at it
And what was your other question?
I don't think so
I mean, as you know, this is a big market
There's lots of companies out there
The problem, it's not identifying companies we like, it's finding ones that are willing to sell, and that's just a continual sort of churning and then beating the bushes effort
Well, I'm going to – I'm going to pass to Terry on the pro forma versus the GAAP growth because I'm not sure I'd understand that if I use same-store
(49:35) the way I always look at it
That was GAAP
I mean, simplistically, the GAAP number only reflects the portion of the year that you own the business
The pro forma number assumes we own the business as the whole year
I don't know the answer
You mean, what is the growth?
It's a reflection of our shipset content
I mean, ROE forecast is pretty simple
I mean, we know our shipset content
We know the production rates for 2017. There's a little bit of an estimate because you don't know what's – if there's a cut in 2018, it could start to ripple back in to 2017 and you have little bit of guess where there is going to any inventory movement
But I mean, our shipset content hasn't changed
The production rates, we think, we were conservative going into the year, we still think we're conservative
David, I don't think it's materially different
I'd use roughly the same percent
Well, if you're not already in this business, it's just tough to get in
As you know, it's a pretty long gestation period to get into this
And product per product, they're pretty small market segments
So I think you know developed from scratch, it's relatively almost very small risk
I mean the other is, do you mean in the M&A world?
In the M&A world these – they tend to be smaller businesses
So one by one they get, where I'd mostly think of is PE, they tend to be small so that they're not as exciting for the other bigger PE firms or even the mid-size ones when they first come up
Frankly, it's tough to compete against us
If you're a PE firm that is looking in a proprietary aerospace business and you're outbidding us, you got to be pretty worried, right, because the only way you're going to do that is to be making a higher bet on the margin improvement
And the other thing is a couple have started it and frankly, we bought them
Odyssey started a roll up and we bought it
McKechnie, JLL started a roll up and we bought it with McKechnie
I don't think there is – as I said, I don't know the exact number on the provisioning but I do not think it's very significant
We didn't see much for the Boeing 787 and I don't believe there's much to it there
I think if you look at the details, it's a pretty broad based booking pick-up across the vast majority of our businesses
Morning
I mean, that's the total average
I don't think the military is way off of that, I don't have the exact number here
Actually, excuse me, it's a little higher
It's more like 60%, 30% or 65%, 35%
So, everybody is waving their hands at me
Okay
So still 55% like I thought
When I said 55%, Ken, the whole place started to waving their arms
No
Rough 55%, 45% just like the overall business
First, just I'm not sure I got the question right
But just the numbers Kevin gave they were like-like same-store
They were organic growth
It's not – the 787 content didn't go up because we bought the content
We compared it before and after with the same mix of businesses, so if you follow
So it's like-like same-store
Why does it go up? Because I think we do a good job
I think we service the account
We're all over the engineering department
I think we are reliable deliverers, the stuff works and we chase it pretty aggressively
Sort of the same reason you sell anything
I think the – you're asking me how much is pricing, how much is units, I think?
I don't know the answer to that
I can tell you it's not a whole lot of price because it's tough to get price at the OEM
I mean, it's some, but it's not a whole lot
So presumptively, that means there's some share gains, but I have to admit I don't know what the number is
Well, yeah, nothing changed with my contracts, as you may or may not know
My contract presently runs through 2019, and my contract presently anticipates that, at some point, I could become an Executive Chairman
I think we changed it because Kevin became President and CEO here, as you know, and I think it more likely fits with our current thinking, though it mostly just gives us more optionality
I don't think so
There's nothing that I could really point out that I have any confidence in in that
And I just want to be sure, I'm not – we're saying, we feel comfortable now with our forecast, our guidance for the year, which is the same as we started the year off with
So, we're not suggesting it looks far more bullish, just the strong bookings give us additional confidence
I think we're mixing questions
We're mixing questions
If you compare the bookings
So, let me say it in case I got them mixed up
If you look at the bookings this quarter against the bookings last quarter, in the commercial transport and aftermarket, they're up about 12%
Just coincidently, coincidently, if you look at the bookings this quarter against the shipments this quarter, they also are up somewhere around 12%
So, it's to say coincidently around the same number, which may be a little confusing
Okay
Let's see
Let me answer that in a couple of ways
I could say, in total – that's not to say it couldn't be account by account, but when you roll the thing up in total, the pricing dynamics and the pricing numbers have not changed substantively for a number of years
It's still roughly we get the same answer
Maybe one unit this year is a little better than another one, but they all tend to put and take and weight up to about the same number, which is one we track very closely
The other question was the distributor versus direct?
In the military, we sell to the distributors and brokers where they get the same price
There is no difference there
In the commercial, I'm not sure of the answer to that
I think it's pretty – I don't think there's a material difference
Well, I think, as you know, we sort of preemptively adjusted the head count about a year ago
I think we may have moved it down a little this quarter, but not by – Kevin, is that right? I think it was down a little
But not on across the board, just units adjusted as it looked to them like they were a little softer or not a little softer
I think, right now – and this is mostly around the commercial transport cycle and when it might start to soften up, I think, right now, we think we've made about what adjustments we think are appropriate, but we'll keep watching it
Our concern is, how long does the commercial transport OEM cycle hold up
When does it start to soften? And when it does, how does that reflect back into this year? So far, we see no indication and we think, frankly, the numbers we used, which we think are still conservative
Hi, and welcome, welcome
I mean, it's essentially – it's not consistent across deals
I mean, it's essentially, we get the margin improvement essentially three ways: some price adjustment; some cost adjustment; and, hopefully, if we bought in to something that's growing, we get a little bit of operating leverage by the business growing
If not, the other way we can get it is by looking at the product lines and seeing if we want the profitable ones and the unprofitable ones
But the vast majority of it typically comes from natural market growth, price adjustment and cost adjustment
Yeah, we'll decide that – the capital allocation is something we'll decide based on how things look when it comes time to make that decision
I'd say the buy through the quarter, frankly, we would have bought more, but we were stuck with the 10b5 plan that, essentially, you have to put it on automatic pilot
And it was on automatic pilot when we made the buys and at what amount we could buy
If we had it to reset, we frankly would have put more – we would have set more in it
Oh, yeah, ramp-up in readiness spending is good
At this point, I'd be very cautious about predicting any significant change in this year
They got to get the budget
They got to place the orders, then it takes a while to ship it
It's always hard to guess when the military starts to buy, but I'm being reticent
In the near term, which I'd define as this year, I'd be cautious about assuming any significant change just because of the inertia and time lag
I would think so, readiness is a – typically readiness means buy more repair parts, buy more services, buy more repairs, all that sort of thing, which is generally good for us
Yeah
Yeah, I can't – I mean, obviously, I can't – I don't know what somebody might do in the fullness of time
I can say it's a long effort if it was to happen and we haven't seen it
And at least typically with the OEMs, in our contracting basis that looks similar to what it has been in the past generally
But I mean, I just – I don't know what someone might do
We have not seen it
I don't think the math works
I think, it's unlikely but I can't be certain on that
But I'll say again, I don't see it and I haven't seen any significant sign of it
I can't answer that generically
I mean, that's very fact and circumstance specific
When I think if you particularly as we get bigger, this gets – when you roll everything up, overall prices are pretty consistent – are consistently above inflation, not miles above or the bottom
And I think, Terry, it's safe to say that when you did the calculation, you assume the reasonable deduct for that?
So, if you take the $1.1 billion, and what's the interest, it is about $580 million? Interest is about $580 million
So, it's $580 million
If you take the $1.1 billion, and I'd also say depending on how they treat distributors, that could be higher
You can deduct the fair amount from that and still be at above $580 million
It's a good platform
Top 15? I don't want to answer that because I don't – I haven't done the math
I don't know the answer, but it's a good platform
I would expect that someday, it would start to show up on our top 15 or 25, but I don't know when and haven't done the math on it
Well, we don't disclose the price
Look, we just don't disclose our price
As I told you, the prices – the weighted up prices are higher than inflation
We will think of inflation is 3%, but it's not miles higher
Well, you ought to think of us as we're – when you look at our aftermarket, the commercial aftermarket, which I presume, which you're mostly talking about, you can pretty well think of us as market weighted
So, different people have different definitions with legacy aircraft and what the retirement rates are, but you can almost think of us like the market
That's about how we're weighted
So, if you think 727s are going run off of at a certain rate, that's how we'll run off
Now, remember, we're interjecting new airplanes into the mix every year or two
So as that runs off, something else moves into that old window, as long as the shipset keeps going
But that's the best way to calibrate it, figure were about market weighted
I'm not sure what it is
I'm not sure of your question
We're trying to get a very specific – the very specific thing we are communicating is the incoming orders or bookings are 12% higher than they were from the same quarter in the previous year
That's one
Number two is, coincidently, the bookings in Q1 are also somewhere around 12% higher than the shipments or the revenues in Q1.
Okay, and remind me if I got mixed up in what the pro forma you were talking about last
