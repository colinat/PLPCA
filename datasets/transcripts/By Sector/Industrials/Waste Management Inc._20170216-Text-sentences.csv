0,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning"
1,The fourth quarter of 2016 saw a continuation of a strong operating and financial results we saw throughout the year
2,"Revenues in the quarter were $3.46 billion, an increase of $214 million, or 6.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015."
3,"Once again, our revenue growth was driven by the successful execution of our price, customer service, disciplined growth strategies in our collection and disposal business"
4,Fourth quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $118 million
5,"Fourth quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices, which drove a $51-million increase in recycling revenues"
6,"Acquisitions, net of divestitures also increased revenues for the quarter by $45 million"
7,Fuel surcharges and foreign currency fluctuations did not significantly impact our revenue for the quarter
8,"Looking at internal revenue growth in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.1%, with total volumes improving 2% and traditional solid waste volumes improving 1.7%"
9,"We saw revenue growth from volume contribute equally to price growth for the first time in over five years, but without compromising our pricing strategy or results"
10,"We focused on improving service to our customers, and our full-year churn improved 100 basis points to 9.1%"
11,This is the lowest churn rate since 2002 when we were at 8.6%
12,"We also saw service increases, exceeding service decreases for the 12 consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth"
13,The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $42 million
14,Operating income margin expanding 10 basis points to 17.8% and operating EBITDA growing $54 million
15,Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits from improving price and now volumes
16,"In the fourth quarter, commercial core price was 7.6% with volumes up 2%, which was a 270-basis-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2015 and an 80-basis-point sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2016."
17,"Industrial core price was 9.7% with volume up 1% in the fourth quarter, while industrial collection volumes continue to improve, the rate of growth moderated when comparing the fourth quarter of 2016 with the prior-year period, which is largely due to the tougher comparisons in C&D volumes"
18,"In the residential line of business, core price was 2.7%, residential volumes were down 2.6% in the fourth quarter, which is the same rate of decline as the fourth quarter of 2015, and a 30-basis-point sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2016."
19,Our focus is on disciplined pricing of the business to ensure an acceptable return on invested capital
20,The combined price and volume in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing almost $19 million and operating EBITDA growing $30 million
21,"In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter"
22,"Total landfill volumes increased 6.2%, with MSW volumes growing 1.6%, C&D volume grew 17.7%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 7.1%"
23,"We achieved core price of 2.5%, about the same as the fourth quarter of 2015."
24,"As Jim mentioned, we made significant progress improving the recycling line of business, which contributed $0.09 of EPS year-over-year"
25,"The majority of the increase in EPS, or $0.065 was driven by improvements in operating cost and renegotiating contract terms"
26,The remaining $0.025 was due to improved commodity prices
27,"For the full year, gross operating expenses per ton improved by 2.4% and average commodity recycling prices at our recycling facilities improved 8.6% and volumes grew 0.8%"
28,And moving now to operating expenses
29,"In the fourth quarter, total operating cost increased $120 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2015."
30,"The cost increases were largely related to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations, which were reflected in higher labor and subcontractor costs"
31,We also saw increases in leachate cost and a 130 basis point impact from higher commodity-based cost related to recycling rebates and fuel expense
32,Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 30 basis points from 62.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 62.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
33,"The improvement in operating expense margin from revenue growth, efficiency gains and cost control efforts was 160 basis points, but this margin improvement was largely offset by the commodity-based cost in the quarter"
34,I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results
35,"Yeah, Michael"
36,CPI or index-driven pricing affects about 40% of our total business
37,"So, to quantify that about a 50 basis point increase in CPI would impact our top-line by $28 million"
38,But I also want to stress as Jim just did that we don't plan for CPI increases in our business plan
39,"So, you're right, an increase has some upside to it, but we don't plan for a decrease either"
40,"Our core pricing strategy allows each area, and we ask them to overcome any CPI increase or decrease with more core pricing, we do that on, obviously, those open-market customers"
41,"So, we've overcome the low CPI rates in past years and you've not seen any impact to that core price"
42,"So, an increase â€"
43,"“ although it will occur, and I think you're right, it does have a roll-forward impact"
44,It would be later in the years
45,You see it because our price increases don't come every month
46,They come especially on those CPI or index-driven price customers
47,"They come periodically, July 1 or October 1 based on the contract term"
48,"So, that will be more of a late 2017, 2018 if we see that CPI increase"
49,"But I stress again, we generally have not let that affect us positively or negatively"
50,We're going to go get core price
51,"We only have a couple of contracts that remain into 2017 that are significant contracts that will fall off and that will give some value there from them, but we have altered all of our agreements, the significant large ones, to make sure that our customers are providing the return or processing their material and then that commodity price impact is minimized"
52,We're not taking that same risk
53,"So, there's only a couple of those lifts"
54,Our operating guys have done a really good work at putting in continuous improvement programs that let us see historically and also look at volumes coming in and just right-size our operations
55,"So, we make sure we get that operating improvement that Jim mentioned"
56,Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
57,LLC
58,Okay
59,"For volumes, I thought about 2% was pretty much better than I expected"
60,"Just looking at the breakdown, was there anything that surprised you within the breakout?"
61,"MSW, C&D, and special, any one-time projects that are going away?"
62,Are there really just tough comps that you're basing your guidance for 2017 on?
63,"Yeah, Andrew, if you look back in our net commercial volume and you go back 6 or 8, 9, 10 quarters, in fact every quarter, we've had good improvement, leading to that 2%, and that's obviously what the economy hasn't driven much of that"
64,"Most of it has come from some of the actions that we've taken around service to our customers, process to handle customers that have issues and how we work through those"
65,Our people in the field have done just a superb job in that regard to get that defection rate down pretty close to the lowest ever
66,"And then, our customer acquisition methods are getting â€"
67,“ we're just getting better at looking for the right kind of volume that Jim stressed to make sure that we still get the contribution from that and don't disrupt the marketplace
68,And that'd be the last thing we want to do
69,"And we're focused really hard on that, picking the right locations that have a little more economy support, and make sure our resources, sales resources and operating resources align with that, so we can take advantage of that growth"
70,And we're using some of our technology tools Jim mentioned to help us in that regard
71,And I think you'll see that continue
72,It's been fairly dramatic on one of our more profitable lines of business and we expect that to continue
73,Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
74,LLC
75,Okay
76,That's it for me
77,"Thanks, guys"
78,"Yeah, Derrick"
79,That has been a positive impact to us as we change some of those contracts over to that wastewater and sewer increase instead of just CPI
80,That's a slow process with cities and counties and government entities because cost is so important to them
81,"I think the other thing I'd mention is that that line of business is an extremely competitive line of business, especially with those midsized and smaller communities"
82,They are always looking for savings
83,"Now, what we've tried to do is look more at just return on invested capital"
84,That line of business has such a strong impact on capital requirements as you retain a contract and that entity wants new trucks or with new business
85,"So, return on invested capital's our primary focus there because it has such an effect on our return and that you all care about and we do as well"
86,"So, we don't look at it as a growth opportunity like we might other lines of business"
87,We look contract by contract
88,"And yeah, we choose to and we will improve that business"
89,"We're doing things using technology and trying to differentiate ourselves, especially on those larger franchise and larger contracts providing some self-service opportunities for customers, some things that local communities look for that we can add to websites both with regard to trash services, but other information that might again set us apart from some of our other competitors"
90,"Looking at increased automation, how can we help with those helpers on the back of the truck and get more focused on the drivers"
91,"Some of the shortages that we see with automation, we tend to retain drivers longer when they have that kind of truck, and we get better return for our shareholders as well"
92,"So all of those things I think will help that line of business, but I don't believe you'll see the dramatic change like you may have in whether it's MSW or special waste or commercial, industrial lines of business"
93,"We'll plod along and make good excellent returns for shareholders, but we'll do it spending money wisely"
94,"$0.04, okay"
95,I should probably take the opportunity first to just recognize our team
96,"That was some excellent long-term contract for us and gives us a real basis for supplying service to the New York City area for a long time, for 20 years in fact"
97,"So, a really good contract for us with a lot of work by that local team, we'll start accepting MTS, MSW in July of 2017."
98,"That waste will go to our Western New York High Acres landfill in early 2018 at the peak of volume, that's about 750,000 tons a year"
99,We'll split that volume between our Western New York landfill and then one of our Virginia landfills
100,We'll spend money
101,We've already started a little bit
102,"That's why you saw some of the capital spin that Devina mentioned going up in 2017, and it's in the $50 million range"
103,"It includes quite a bit of containers, primary amount of spin"
104,"Those MTS is, by the way, when they're fully operational"
105,the New York City â€
106,"“ they're implementing, they're executing and building out those transfer stations"
107,"We'll end up handling 1.8 million tons for the city at the end of this in total given two MTS contracts, the long-term Bronx contract we have, the Brooklyn contract that we have, and the Queens contract we have"
108,It's sizeable
109,"Over a 20-year period, it's little over $3 billion in revenue"
110,"Because of the line of business, Joe, it ends up â€“ that contract ends up being an accretive to margin contract because disposal is such a high margin for us"
111,Yeah
112,"Barbara, we have not seen dramatic change in competition there"
113,It's a very competitive line of business
114,But we've not seen anything different recently
115,"I mean, it's been such short time since they move forward"
116,And I don't think that'll happen in the short term
117,It takes a lot high cardboard prices to make that happen and sustained
118,I think people have been burned enough that they're not going to spend capital with new facilities until we see the right direction
119,"And, yes, I think in general, I mean, we don't change things because of what others do"
120,"But at the same time, from just hearsay, we think it's so prudent to do what we all have been doing around de-risking that business, and we don't see any signs of that changing"
121,"Yes, you're right, Tyler"
122,"I didn't mention the LA contract, but it's a new agreement that we've been awarded"
123,We've been awarded two of those zones that the City of LA has extended
124,We've got the exclusive commercial and multi-family franchise for the West Valley and Southeast Valley zones
125,"The real good thing there is that they are contiguous with our current infrastructure, and it really fits our business"
126,And we're very pleased with that
127,"It's also a large contract, life of value of that contract"
128,It's a 10-year deal
129,It's $1.3 billion at accretive margins to the company
130,"But in our plan, I mean the LA is scheduled to start July 1, to the point of your question, July 1."
131,"We have until the end of the year, so until January of 2018, to make the transition"
132,"And the real issue there as opposed to New York City is that we currently have 8,500 customers in that open market of LA that's going to these franchises, we'll end up with 16,000 customers by roughly January of 2018."
133,"So, they'll piece their way into our structure during the course of the second half of 2017."
134,"Yeah, so"
135,A lot of operating involved
136,A lot of operating cost changes that'll occur in the second half of the year
137,"So, I don't think you'll see dramatic value"
138,And we haven't put that in our plan dramatically at to be at July 1 run rate
139,We've parsed that in throughout the months in the second half of this year
140,The same for New York City
141,"Although it starts July 1, there's some work to be done at the MTSs and to get the rail capability right for High Acres and Atlantic"
142,"So, that'll piece its way in"
143,"They'll help our volumes, but there I think our volume forecast and guidance is about what we expect"
144,"Three points to â€“ that total agreement with Jim and your theory of, for example, our addition rate and that's largely driven by the commercial line of business, although it includes the industrial line as well, the permanent business on the industrial roll-off line"
145,"But we have flipped that addition rate and defection rate, so that we're net positive in number of new customers, starting roughly midyear to early third quarter last year"
146,"And that, we see that continuing of the add rate has gone up fairly dramatically, just as the defection rate has gone down"
147,So those lines have crossed
148,"And that's a really good sign for us, both in the selling process, but in the overall economy, as you mentioned"
149,"The other thing I mentioned earlier, is that service increases have outpaced decreases 12 consecutive quarters, and that's a real positive for us"
150,And it bodes well given some of the economy improvements that we're seeing
151,"And then lastly, the container weight issue has not changed dramatically for us up or down"
152,"I mean, it stayed about where it is"
153,"And that's, we think, a good sign"
154,"The economy is moving forward, and we think we will gain both revenue, but more importantly margin out of that growth"
155,"Yeah, just flattish, it depends on quarter-by-quarter, it's changed some"
156,But not so much with service increases
157,That's been very consistently positive
158,"And I think the lack of acquisition at the same level as what we've done with those three regionals that Jim mentioned, we have in there"
159,"I think a little over $100 million, $150 million in tuck-in acquisitions"
160,But we don't have acquisitions at the same level as the last three years in the plan
161,"We'd love for them to happen, but we're not forecasting that today"
162,I completely agree with you
163,Whether it's MSW regulations that affect our landfills or whether it's regulatory impacts to our landfill structure or recycling or hazardous waste business
164,"Those states are allowed to exceed the federal guidelines and some do, and I don't see that impacted"
165,I just don't see states getting in and changing those kinds of regulations that would impact our business
166,Could something come out of the blue?
167,I guess it could
168,"But I have seen nothing, no discussion or no intonation that it's even close to affecting our business the way the question was worded"
169,But they still have to clean them up
170,"That's the upside, right?"
171,"That we think that could come out of this, but as we've said to the earlier question, it's a little hard to tell because we just don't have real goods visibility yet"
172,"One more time, Michael"
173,"Yeah, down to the Atlantic landfill"
174,"Well, first of all, Michael, we don't publicize that number, we don't â€"
175,“ the individual disposal component
176,It is an all-in price for transportation and disposal and includes a lot of handling up the material and moving the material
177,But it is not going to be a detrimental impact to the company on a margin basis
178,"It is accretive in margin both EBIT, EBITDA"
179,"So, we are â€"
180,“ that's â€
181,“ those two are very good contracts for us
