0,"Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning"
1,Our second quarter results have again demonstrated the cash-generating strength of our company
2,"Our tactical focus on improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs is clearly the right direction for our business"
3,"The end result of that focus is once again a strong operating EBITDA performance, which translated into robust cash flow in the quarter"
4,Our operating EBITDA grew about 8% in the quarter to $1.029 billion when compared to the second quarter of 2016.
5,This was the highest operating EBITDA we've ever achieved in any quarter in Waste Management's long history
6,"As a result, our free cash flow grew almost 13% for the same comparative period despite a significant increase in cash taxes paid"
7,The conversion rate of operating EBITDA to free cash flow has increased sequentially for the past three quarters to over 50% in the second quarter of 2017.
8,"Devina will discuss our cash flow in detail, but we exceeded our internal expectations"
9,And we remain confident that we can meet the upper end of our full year guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion
10,"Turning to earnings per share, we generated $0.81 of EPS in the second quarter, an increase of 10.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2016."
11,"Included in that 10.4% growth were a $0.04 drag to EPS, $0.02 from an increased tax rate, $0.01 from the expiration of fuel tax credits and $0.01 from two small impairments"
12,"But even with that $0.04 of headwind, we grew EPS by $0.07 versus the second quarter of 2016."
13,"Driving strong growth in EPS, EBITDA and free cash flow with solid growth in revenue and operating income, our revenues grew by $252 million or 7.4%"
14,"And just as we saw in the first quarter, this increase was organically driven"
15,Our income from operations grew 9.4% and margins also expanded with the income from operation margin of 30 basis points
16,One of the drivers of our success was the disciplined execution of our pricing programs
17,"In the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and our yield was 1.9%"
18,"Our focus on disciplined pricing remains unchanged as demonstrated by our core price results, which are well above our full year goal"
19,"Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 3.2% in the second quarter"
20,"We continue to focus on areas of the economy that are experiencing growth, and we are retaining customers through our improved customer service"
21,"In the second quarter, the underlying volume growth in our business remains strong in the commercial, industrial, and landfill lines of business"
22,And we also saw slight improvements in the rate of decline in our residential business
23,"As a result, we would expect our volumes to exceed our full year goal"
24,"And as you can see, we're maintaining our price discipline, while growing our volume"
25,"So, we're hitting on all cylinders right now, with the cash-generating strength of our business shining brightly in 2017."
26,"Looking beyond 2017, we've talked recently about our strategy of bringing more technology to bear in our business and about creating a 21st Century HR organization"
27,"On the people front, we're tackling long-term opportunities like reducing driver turnover, building best-in-class leadership development, and leading in the field of training and performance management"
28,"Regarding technology, our focus there is intended to serve as a differentiator to help us continue down this path of strong organic growth"
29,"They will come in several different forms, including customer-facing technologies for e-commerce and self-service, use of big data for predictive analytics like maintenance and dynamic routing, and improvement in our cost structure over the long-term through the application of robotics and autonomy"
30,"Of course, we will not lose our focus on disciplined capital expenditures and SG&A expense control as we proceed with this long-term strategy"
31,We plan to have a strategic leader of the technology function placed by year-end
32,"So, to sum it up, we've had an exceptional first half of 2017 and our employees continue to execute our plans and deliver strong performance"
33,"In the second half of 2017, we expect to see the momentum from the first half continue"
34,"As a result, we expect to meet the upper end of both our full year EPS guidance of between $3.14 and $3.18, and our full year free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion"
35,I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter operating results in more detail
36,"Good morning, Brian"
37,"Sure, Brian"
38,"I would actually say we felt good about our margins for the quarter, and here's why"
39,"The EBITDA margins were up 10 basis points, or better by 10 basis points, but they were impacted by two factors"
40,"You mentioned the one, which was fuel tax credits"
41,That was worth about 20 basis points to us in margin
42,But the other one that Jim's going to give a little bit of color on is our recycling brokerage business
43,"And that recycling brokerage business was up over 5% in revenue, which impacted margins by 50 basis points"
44,"And so, if you exclude those two, you're talking about 70 basis points of margin accretion there"
45,"So, that's why I would say we felt good about our margins even being better by only 10 basis points on the EBITDA line"
46,"I mean, I think the acquisition landscape is pretty healthy right now and our pipeline is pretty healthy right now, too"
47,"We're going to talk about several today, in fact"
48,"So, I think you'll see us â€"
49,“ we've always kind of talked about our normal tuck-ins ranging between $100 million and $200 million
50,"Last year, we were towards the lower end of that range"
51,"I would tell you, Brian, that this year we'll be at the higher end of that range"
52,"So, I wouldn't disagree with what one of our counterparts said about the M&A landscape"
53,"Hamzah, one thing I would add to this, and we've given some long answers to the first two questions here from you and Brian, but I think it's worth really addressing this"
54,But Devina is absolutely right about this
55,"I mean, it is the biggest components of free cash flow that's actually driving it, which is EBITDA"
56,"I mean, growing EBITDA by 8% organically is no easy task"
57,"And if you back up the line from there, growing revenue by 7.4% in an economy that's kind of a 1.5% or 2% economy, and doing all that with organic growth, to me, is really impressive"
58,And you may â€
59,“ you look at revenue
60,"Even if you took out commodity price completely, if you said, okay, fine, but you're growing your revenue, come on, take it out, take that out completely"
61,", we still grew revenue organically by 4.1% in a 1.5% or 2% economy, double or 2.5 times the economy"
62,"So, the fact that this is all translating down into free cash â€“ cash from operations and then free cash is not surprising to us, but we're really pleased with the fact that these big financial metrics that we focus on are performing as well as they are"
63,"Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
64,That's very helpful
65,Just a follow-up
66,and I'll turn it over
67,"Historically, yourself and the sector has raised guidance on the second quarter based on seasonality of volumes that when you first give guidance, you don't have visibility on"
68,It seems like things are coming in better than expected relative to the start of the year
69,"And so I'm just curious, how conservative is your guidance, because you've left it unchanged?"
70,Thank you
71,"Well, we really didn't leave it unchanged"
72,We said the guidance is a range
73,"So, if you think about EPS, for example, $3.14 to $3.18, it's a range"
74,"And now, we've said we'll be at the top end of the range"
75,"So, if you assume that when we give the range, we're kind of in the middle at kind of $3.16, then we're saying we're â€"
76,"“ in effect we're raising guidance to the top end of the range, and you could say the same about free cash flow"
77,"So, what we'll do, though, is at the end of Q3 is reassess and look at the first three quarters and decide"
78,"are we going to exceed the top end of the range or are we still comfortable at the top end, where we are now"
79,"Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
80,Understood
81,Yeah
82,"What I would say, our volume â€“ and Jim, you can add some color to this, too, but one thing that's pleasing to us about volume is that it's not just a big lump that we're seeing here"
83,"If you look at commercial volumes, commercial volumes have improved every quarter since Q2 of 2014, so a fairly long string of improvement that we're seeing"
84,It's not as if we're seeing a big lump all in Q2.
85,The roll-off business has been recently strong for the last seven quarters
86,"Resi has shown â€“ albeit still in the red, but resi has shown volume improvement for five consecutive quarters"
87,"And then, the landfills, Jim talked about MSW, C&D volumes being very strong, and special waste maybe being â€"
88,“ the combination of special waste and revenue-generating cover was the lowest number on the page
89,And that one probably has some opportunity and we feel good about our special waste pipeline at this point
90,"So, I think the fact that volume has been on this consistent upward trend is really the encouraging part for me"
91,"I'd be a little more concerned about it as being one-time if we saw a big blip in second quarter, but we really didn't"
92,It's just been a gradual increase in all lines of business
93,"No, there are third-party vendors"
94,"Technology for us encompasses a number of different items including things like, as you say, AI"
95,AI is kind of a longer-term opportunity for us when we think about robotics or autonomy
96,"I think in the short-term, what you're seeing is us spending our kind of innovative time on customer-facing technologies such as the ones that Jim mentioned, e-commerce and self-service, and then also on big data for the use in our pricing tools and in things like predictive maintenance and routing and logistics"
97,I think you're right
98,I think it's â€
99,“ and I think you're also right that this eventually ends up being something that we see across the larger companies
100,"But the smaller companies, it will be a differentiator for us"
101,"But we think we're the leader in the industry and in technology, and we continue to invest that way"
102,We're spending somewhere between $100 million to $150 million in tax spend each year
103,We're putting somebody â€
104,"“ a leader in that position, the Chief Technology Officer position, by the end of the year"
105,"So, we see technology as a differentiator for us within the industry, but I do think over the long-term, it probably ends up being more versus the smaller companies"
106,"Good news about fewer work days is, it actually is a positive for us on the bottom line"
107,It just is not going to show up as a positive on a year-over-year comp basis in terms of absolutes
108,"But on the bottom line, it ends up being a positive for us having fewer work days"
109,It's like 1.7 days in Q4 and 0.3 days in Q3.
110,Yeah
111,"I mean, there are obviously a few of those than the tuck-ins"
112,"And once you get to larger deals, then we, because of our size, have to consider HSR filings and things like that"
113,"So, it's not to say that there aren't deals out there of larger size"
114,They involve more efforts for us from a justice perspective
115,Doesn't mean they're not good
116,We've done three of them over the last four years
117,"But for now, we're focused on those tuck-ins"
118,"And then, as those other opportunities present themselves, I think that's really"
119,Devina's point is that the balance sheet gives us the ability to do those
120,"The $100 million to $200 million just comes out of free cash flow, but if you start thinking about bigger deals, you have a balance sheet that's able to easily absorb bigger deals"
121,But they are the â€
122,"“ Jim, China is the big buyer in the market"
123,"So, when they start tinkering with policies that could impact commodity prices, we have to be increasingly aware of that"
124,Yes
125,It's hard to predict
126,"I wish I had a crystal ball here because, remember, back at the end of Q1, we had just finished with a really good quarter"
127,"And all of a sudden, China comes out and does something kind of crazy, and prices for OCC dropped to 25% or 30% in a period of a week"
128,And we don't have a lot of ability to hedge ourselves there
129,The markets are pretty thinly traded
130,"So, it's a bit hard to predict"
131,"What I would say though about the back half of the year with respect to commodity prices is that comparisons do get more difficult, particularly as you get into Q4."
132,"Last year, you may recall that we talked about the normal kind of seasonal decline in commodity prices that you tend to see from Q3 to Q4, and that we did not see in 2016."
133,I'm not sure that we are expecting a repeat of that
134,I think you probably will see it as a normal seasonal decline in commodity prices after they've done all of their kind of Christmas and holiday buying
135,"So, we think that Q4, in particular, has more difficult comps on commodity prices, but the rest of businesses doing so well and even the recycling business on the cost side is doing so well that we're still very comfortable with going to the top end of our range, as we mentioned earlier"
136,Yeah
137,It's a good finishing question there
138,"I would tell you, we're not looking for a Chief Information Officer"
139,We're not looking for somebody to come in and who has a strong â€
140,“ necessarily a strong IT background to come in and look at things like data structures and systems integrations and things like that
141,"We think we have a really good team internally to do that, and we're in the process of doing that already"
142,We're in the process of consolidating data
143,We're in the process of looking where we have data overlap and making sure that we establish data consistency and eliminating some of our applications where we have multiple applications that sometimes do the same thing
144,"So, we're not necessarily looking in this new Chief Technology Officer for a more traditional Chief Information Officer"
145,We're looking for somebody that has an understanding of â€
146,"“ if not our business directly, an understanding of this type of routing or logistics-type business in general that also can bring some innovation to bear on those newer types of technologies â€"
147,"“ not just data, we've talked a lot about data, but as you mentioned, robotics technology, and then longer term working with our organic growth group on things like autonomy"
148,"I mean, we think that autonomy is â€“ particularly as we think about the collection side of our business is a longer term aspiration for us because while the technology is moving forward, there is a big difference between where the technology is and where the public perception and government regulation is"
149,But all of those we do think will eventually come to our industry
150,"In the near-term, we're going to be focusing this person more on those customer-facing technologies, e-commerce and self-service, and then better use of data to make us as efficient as we can be"
151,You're giving us a lot of credit for following all those numbers -
152,"Well, that's why, Michael, in all of our scripts, we spend a lot of time talking about cash today because it is â€"
153,"“ you're absolutely right, I mean, the cash â€"
154,“ the conversion here is impressive
155,"And so, not only is the conversion price, but the absolute numbers themselves"
156,That's why I talked about revenue growing at 7.4%
157,"I mean, all of these numbers are kind of 2, 3, 4 times the overall economy"
158,"But you're absolutely right, the conversion is impressive"
159,"But the margins â€“ and we didn't want to lose sight of that, the margin strength of the business is there"
160,"It just was masked a little bit by â€“ in particular, by these two items that Jim talked about, which was the brokerage side of our business and the loss of the tax credit"
161,"It's, Michael, why I went through that brokerage business and the recycling business overall is to clearly show not just its impact on margin and how great"
162,", I think, the core business is operating, but it's also to show us all that there's value in that recycling and commodity â€“ or brokerage side of that business to the overall network"
163,"Well, so, keep in mind, first of all, we said we'd be a 2% yield company and we're at 1.9%"
164,"So, we're pretty darn close"
165,"But keep in mind that the yield calculation really is â€“ and you know this, but the yield calculation is a unit rate comparison that includes the impact on unit rate of new business"
166,"So, by definition, when you bring new business on, and we're obviously bringing new business on"
167,"when you look at our volume numbers, it has a dampening effect on unit rate comps"
168,"I mean, no matter how good that business is, and our sales team, and led by Jim and all of his lieutenants, when they look at new business, they are very much looking at bringing good new business on, but the fact of the matter is that that new business has not gone through a price increase"
169,"And we have customers that have been with us for 10, 15 years that have gone through a price increase every year"
170,"So, by definition, that new business will have a dampening effect on unit rate comps, which is why we focus on not just yield, but we focus on core price"
171,We think core price is probably â€
172,"“ well, not probably, is a far better representation of the price increases that we take on our core business and the rollbacks and the fees, and that, to us, is the best kind of corollary, I guess, to what's happening with our cost structure"
173,"You're right, our cost structure is going up more than 1.9%, but our core price has gone up by 4.7%"
174,"Yeah, I would tell you, Michael, I'm not sure we've fully quantified the number to be able to answer your question sufficiently"
175,What I will say about both technology on dynamic routing and on maintenance is this
176,I'll talk to maintenance first
177,"We do think that when you have to reactively repair a vehicle, it's probably 1.5 to 2 times as expensive as proactively repairing it, because when you have a vehicle breakdown on the road, you've got other costs in there"
178,You simply don't have â€
179,“ you don't have towing cost if you're proactively repairing it
180,You don't have the overtime cost for the driver
181,"You don't have a â€“ and by the way, that 1.5 to 2 times does not include the impact to the customer"
182,"So, while we haven't gone through and quantified that impact yet on more of a macro basis, we do believe that moving much more towards predictive or proactive, however you want to talk about it, maintenance is a big efficiency and cost improver for us"
183,"And then on to routing and logistics, we talked about routing and logistics a lot over the last of couple of years with our SDO initiative, but most of the improvement that we've made has been on the front-end of the day and the back-end of the day for the driver"
184,"So, the front-end of the day being their pre-trip and the back-end of the day being their post-trip, we really believe we have established almost complete unanimity there within our systems, that being our districts"
185,"But within the middle of the day, which is the route itself, only about 30% of our routes are truly dynamically routed"
186,And so we feel like we've got some real opportunity left within our routing and logistics to pick up some incremental dollars
187,"As you recall, a couple of years ago, we valued that at about $100 million improvement"
188,"So, when we started talking about this maybe four years ago, we thought it was about $100 million in improvement that we would get from routing and logistics"
189,"And so we've certainly seen a piece of that with the improvement in the pre-trip and the post-trip, but we think there still is opportunity"
190,"I would tell you, we're kind of in the ninth inning or at the end of the game with respect to â€"
191,"“ maybe we're never at the end of the game, but we're in the ninth inning with respect to the pre-trip and post-trip"
192,We're still in the fifth inning or the fourth inning with respect to pulling the most efficiencies out of the route itself
193,"I mean, look, we're working with"
194,"both heavy equipment and heavy truck manufacturing partners, but it's really on an R&D basis"
195,"And in the short-term, we're going to test an autonomous vehicle in one of our landfills in one of our MRFs probably within the next 12 months"
196,"But as I mentioned, and you said as well, that putting an autonomous vehicle on a collection route and I would like to be a residential route, is a much longer term aspiration for us because of that public perception and government regulation"
197,"I mean, the technology I think is moving pretty quickly there, but public perception and government regulation have to catch up with that"
198,And I just can't predict when that's going to happen
199,I think that's a longer term aspiration for us on our collection business
200,You and I are in the same boat there
201,What's holding back the guidance?
202,Is that what you said?
203,"Well, so two things"
204,"One was, just to give you the numbers, the guidance for volume was 1.2% to 1.6%"
205,"And we said we'll be at the high end of that or above that actually, that 1.6%"
206,"And then, core price, I think, was 4% -"
207,4%
208,"So, I would tell you that with respect to guidance, as we said earlier, we are effectively raising guidance here because of the fact that we gave a range initially, and now we're saying we're not going to be in the range"
209,"When you give a range, it kind of implies that the middle is what your actual number is, but you're going to give yourself a little wiggle room on both sides"
210,"Now, by saying we'll be at the top end of that range, we have in effect raised guidance from the middle to the top"
211,Yeah
212,"I mean, I think we've done some waiting"
213,"I don't think we really changed our approach, though"
214,"Our approach has been that we want to be â€“ that whoever we look at as an acquisition candidates for us, it has to be properly priced based on our analysis and then it has to be the right strategic business for us to acquire"
215,And that's been our approach for as long as I've been here in Houston
216,"To answer your first question, our expectation is high"
217,I would say they might be a little higher
218,I'm not sure they're high
219,I think they're a little higher just because you've seen our multiples creep up
220,"The big three, within our industry, multiples have crept up a little bit"
221,"And so, as a consequence, some of these folks that we're looking to acquire are not blind to that"
222,"But that doesn't change our approach, which is that we want â€"
223,“ we want these companies to meet or exceed our expectations from a financial perspective
224,You're talking about volume or -
225,Yeah
226,We're pleased with July margins so far
227,Yeah
228,"When I looked at internalization earlier, we were â€"
229,“ it's pretty much the same number
230,And that being that the â€
231,"“ when we think about internalization, is the percentage that we â€“ actually, that we collect, that we didn't turn around and take to our sites is about 66.5%"
232,"And it's been in that 66% range since as far back as I was looking, which was 2010."
233,"So, it hasn't changed dramatically"
234,Yeah
235,Thank you
236,"Producing these levels of organic growth in almost every financial metric that are 2, 3, even 4 times the overall growth of North American economies can only be done through the collective efforts of our team of 42,000 people"
237,"And every day that passes for me in this CEO job, I'm more and more amazed by this team's dedication, innovation, work ethic, and their willingness to change"
238,"So, thank you to all of Waste Management's 42,000 team members for this performance"
239,And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning
240,We'll talk to you again next quarter
