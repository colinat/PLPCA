1,"In a quarter where two of our biggest operating areas were heavily impacted by hurricanes, our employees maintained their focus on servicing our customers, improving core price, growing profitable volume and controlling costs to produce arguably the best quarter Waste Management has had in its history"
2,Our operating EBITDA grew by about 7% in the quarter to $1.071 billion when compared to the third quarter of 2016.
3,This is the second consecutive quarter of record operating EBITDA
4,The strong operating EBITDA continued to translate into free cash flow at a conversion rate of almost 50%
5,"And as a result, our free cash flow grew more than 18% for the same comparative period, despite an increase in cash taxes paid and capital spending"
6,Devina will discuss our cash flow in detail
7,"But based upon our performance through the first nine months of the year, we are raising our full year free cash flow guidance"
8,"Our new guidance range is $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion, up from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion"
9,"We generated $0.90 of EPS in the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2016."
10,In that EPS number was a $0.01 negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma and a $0.01 drag from the expiration of fuel tax credits
11,"Despite these $0.02 of headwinds, we grew EPS by $0.06 versus the third quarter of 2016."
12,"Given our strong earnings performance, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share"
13,"Our new guidance range is $3.19 to $3.21, up from $3.14 to $3.18."
14,"As we saw in the second quarter, our strong growth in EPS, EBITDA and free cash flow was driven by solid growth in revenue and operating income"
15,Our revenues grew by $168 million or 4.7%
16,The majority of the revenue growth was from yield and volume growth in our traditional solid waste business
17,"In addition, the recycling line of business contributed $52 million to our revenue growth"
18,We continue to focus on disciplined pricing as demonstrated by core price continuing to exceed our full year target
19,"In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and our yield was 2%"
20,Our strong pricing led to income from operations growing 8.3% and income from operations margin improving 60 basis points
21,"On the recycling front, the third quarter was solid in spite of commodity price pressure we started to see late in the quarter"
22,Our recycling earnings grew a little more than $0.01 per share when compared to the third quarter of 2016.
23,"While prices remained strong for most of the quarter, up 26.5% year-over-year, we were impacted on the volume side, primarily due to the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, where some of our customers' recycling programs continue to be temporarily suspended"
24,"As a result, our tons sold in September were at the lowest level that we've seen in seven years and third quarter recycled MRF tons declined 9.1%"
25,There are several issues that could impact recycling results in the fourth quarter and the early part of 2018.
26,"In July, China announced to the World Trade Organization that they were going to ban 24 materials from import into China beginning in 2018."
27,"However, this ban is expected to have a minimal impact to Waste Management given the materials that we export to China"
28,"In September, our Chinese mill customers informed us that the government was not issuing additional import licenses for recycled materials such as newsprint and cardboard"
29,"Since China has been a large customer of recycled materials, this has put the global recycling industry in a bind and forced processors around the world to find alternative markets for materials we collect every day"
30,"Thanks to our recycling group's expertise and global relationships, we've been able to leverage alternative recycling markets outside of China to further de-risk the business"
31,Recycling is a key service offering for our customers
32,And I'm proud to say that our customers' materials received at our MRFs have been processed and not warehoused or landfilled as a result of this disruption
33,"For the fourth quarter, the month of October has seen a significant drop in pricing and we now expect a negative $0.03 impact in the quarter from our recycling operations on a year-over-year basis"
34,"However, we do not expect the low pricing in October to become a new normal and while we typically would not give 2018 guidance at this time, based upon current market conditions, we expect to see a $0.04 decline in recycling earnings in 2018 when compared to 2017, heavily weighted to the first half of the year"
35,Our recycling team has worked hard to ensure we have a sound business model and that business will continue to generate strong return on invested capital
36,These market conditions continue to evolve and fluctuate and we will update our assumptions when we give 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call
37,"As we've mentioned on previous calls, we've been looking for a strategic leader of our technology function"
38,"The digital era in which we all live affords us tremendous opportunities to grow our business, make it easier for our customers to do business with us using tools and platforms that meet their needs and make us more efficient than we are today"
39,"To that end, I'm very pleased to announce that Nikolaj Sjoqvist has been promoted to the new role of Chief Digital Officer"
40,Nikolaj held the position of Vice President of Revenue Management for six years
41,"Prior to coming to Waste Management, he spent five years with McKinsey and Company and 10 years with Compaq HP"
42,"Nikolaj has developed an in-depth knowledge of our business, customers, systems and operations"
43,"He is a firm believer in the use of data, analytics and customer insights, all of which will be important components of our company-wide digital strategy"
44,I have no doubt that he is the right leader to take us on this new and important journey
45,"To sum it up, we've performed very well during the first nine months of 2017."
46,"And in our third quarter, we delivered an impressive $0.10 diluted earnings per share year-over-year improvement in our traditional solid waste business"
47,"Looking into the fourth quarter, despite an anticipated negative $0.03 per diluted share impact from our recycling operations, we are raising our full-year guidance"
48,We're confident that our employees will continue to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and into 2018.
49,I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter operating results in more detail
50,"Hi, Derrick"
51,I think it's all of the above
52,The way we came up with the $0.04 is that we looked at September pricing
53,September OCC pricing â€“
54,"and OCC is the commodity that's been most impacted by this, and so September OCC pricing, export pricing was down about 24% from the peaks in July"
55,"So we took a look at it and said, another 5% decline from there puts us at about export OCC pricing, about the same export OCC pricing that we saw in Q4 of 2016, which felt reasonable to us"
56,and that's the number we used to build up to a $0.04 decline in recycle earnings for 2018.
57,"Well, I think, Derrick, I think Jim's color there reinforces why we don't feel that the October lows are the right baseline to use, that we're already starting to see, as Jim said, some promising signs coming into November"
58,"Yeah, that's the same number we used"
59,"I think, when you look at the adds (32:21), whether you look at EBITDA margins or gross margins, I mean that was certainly a good story for us this quarter"
60,And last quarter we â€
61,“ it was something we talked about our brokerage business dampening it a bit
62,and it still did
63,But we were just able to overcome that this quarter
64,I think it is sustainable going forward
65,"We've talked about, on the EBITDA margins line being 50 basis points to 100 basis points up year-over-year"
66,and we think we'll be right in that range when we finish 2017.
67,"We continue to focus on operating costs and I mentioned it, I think, in â€"
68,"“ well, in my script and I think, Devina mentioned in hers, that â€“ or Jim in his, that we have some technology that we're putting into place"
69,We are continually focused through our onboard computers on improving operating costs through efficiency gains
70,"Devina, I know mentioned that SG&A is an area that we have always been focused, at least over the last five years to six years"
71,"and we're pleased with the results there,"
72,so
73,"And then, I think the last thing that I would say, Hamzah, is that what we're really seeing"
74,"and it's affecting margins, is that we're starting to see the leverage of kind of 2% price and 2% volume"
75,It's something that Steiner mentioned several times over a couple year period and
76,"we were never quite able to get there, although we made good strides"
77,We've finally gotten there
78,"and it's really, really showing up in spades in our â€“ not only in our EBITDA and free cash flow, but also in our margins"
79,Here's what I would say about the hurricanes
80,"I mean, first of all, in terms of predicting the benefit to us and there will be a benefit to us"
81,But in terms of predicting that benefit for â€
82,"“ whether it's Q4 or the first part of 2018, it's a bit difficult and I'll give you an example of why it's hard"
83,"In Texas for example, in Houston specifically, a lot of that Hurricane debris has gone to these temporary holding areas"
84,And I assume that the reason for that was to get it off of people's yards as quickly as they could
85,So a lot of the debris has not yet made its way to landfills and
86,so we think there is some real opportunity
87,The collection side of the business is really handled for the most part by FEMA and so we don't see a whole lot on the collection side
88,Where we ultimately see benefit from natural disasters is in the landfills
89,"And then once reconstruction begins, we see it in our roll-off line of business"
90,"And then as I mentioned in my script, Hamzah, we saw a bit of it just through the temporary suspension of recycling programs in the recycle line of business"
91,"To kind of put a cap on this, we think that it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.02 impact for us, a bit hard to predict because we're not exactly sure how much volume is out there in either Florida or in Texas, but we think it's probably a $0.02 benefit, could be a little bit higher, could be a little bit lower, but somewhere in that neighborhood over the coming months"
92,"Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
93,Thanks a lot
94,Yes
95,"Look, it's not that we didn't see this coming, but we felt like in July, look, we're halfway through the year, let's â€"
96,"“ I think every time we've ever raised guidance in the past, we've waited until the third quarter to do it, because things can happen throughout the year that â€“ and what you don't want to do is raise your guidance and then find out that you didn't anticipate something or something happened that's caused the other direction"
97,"So I mean, I would answer your question by saying two things"
98,"One is, we knew we were having a good year when we were on our second quarter earnings call, but in the interest of being reasonably conservative, we wanted to wait until third quarter to really kind of reaffirm that, and that's why we're raising guidance in Q3."
99,"Yeah, I think, Michael, just to tag on to Devina's comments"
100,"Really, the two things that have â€"
101,“ this is a story about EBITDA and working capital when it comes to cash from operations
102,And it's â€
103,"“ Devina mentioned, the reasons behind working capital and the procure to pay program, or technology we put into place, but also really strong landfill volumes, really strong volumes across the board, and those landfill volumes and our overall volumes"
104,continue as we look at the month of October
105,"I was just going to say, CapEx comes in right where we said it would, which is the high end of the original guidance"
106,"We originally guided $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and"
107,I believe last quarter we said we'd be at the high end of that
108,And so we're going to come in right at the high end of that CapEx number
109,"I mean, if you look at the storm debris, Michael, for the third quarter"
110,and I went through kind of our expectations for Q4 and beyond
111,"But if you look at the third quarter, really the revenue impact for the third quarter was only $1.28 million and that seems amazing, but it's not that surprising when you consider that there is an initial kind of hit both on revenue and on operating cost"
112,The operating cost impact was almost $3.1 million and add to that the SG&A impact from the donations and you get to a negative $6 million for the third quarter
113,and that's where you get the $0.01 in Q3.
114,"Yeah, a little bit less than $7 million"
115,Pretty soon you're going to talk us into giving guidance here for 2018.
116,"Yeah, I mean, look, I think we feel â€"
117,“ here's the bottom line
118,"I mean I think, we feel very good about the operating leverage of the business"
119,We feel good about the volumes that we're seeing and the kind of 7% to 8% growth that we're seeing in EBITDA
120,"As Devina mentioned, CapEx is a bit of a â€"
121,"“ I wouldn't say a wildcard because that implies that we don't control it, we do"
122,But we may or may not be in that 9% to 10% range in 2018.
123,She talked a bit about why
124,"One thing she did mention was investing more heavily in our CNG fleet, because we're seeing a very nice payback for a CNG truck versus a diesel truck in terms of not only the cost of fuel, but also maintenance cost"
125,"So I think, we feel good about the long-term growth prospects of the business and we'll talk more about where we think free cash will be for 2018, when we get to the beginning of the quarter next year"
126,"So, far that's what we're looking for"
127,"Good morning, Tyler"
128,We think it's probably $0.02 in the fourth quarter
129,Well
130,"No, I don't think they're going to be down"
131,"I mean, there are always some reasons why year-over-year comps can be difficult and Jim talked about that a bit for Q3, actually having one that was a positive for us that will cause next year to be a difficult comp for us"
132,"But, I think largely MSW volumes are driven by two things, driven by us differentiating ourselves and taking potentially a bigger slice of the pie and then driven by the overall growth of the pie itself"
133,"I would tell you that on the overall growth of the pie, that the economy feels reasonably good right now"
134,"As we look out into 2018, we don't see any storm clouds on the horizon, not that they couldn't show up, but right now it looks reasonably good"
135,And then part of why we're excited about putting Nikolaj in the technology position is that we're already starting to separate ourselves through the use of things like customer analytics and use of data reporting and then technology to our customer in terms of a customer interface
136,So differentiation in the economy give us some room for optimism here as we think about MSW volumes and total volumes going into 2018.
137,"It was just going to say, for Q3, Tyler, it was about $8 million,"
138,right
139,"So the $25.6 million increase in absolute dollars in SG&A cost year over year, about $8 million of it was related to that"
140,Thank you
141,"I would tell you, Jeff, that while wage inflation is certainly a consideration for us, maybe an even bigger consideration is tackling turnover and making sure that we are doing everything we can to limit the amount of turnover that we have"
142,"It's a fact of life for us but to the extent that we can limit it, is a huge, huge value for us"
143,"There is a significant cost to every employee, be that a driver or a technician or an accountant when we turn them over and the training cost and kind of the ramp up are all costly to us"
144,So we have put a real focus on reducing turnover
145,"Morning, Corey"
146,"Yeah, I mean, look, I think the underlying trends are good"
147,I briefly mentioned when Michael was questioning us about October
148,And so October looks very strong
149,"It's always hard to tell what volumes are going to do, looking six months out"
150,We do have a pipeline in our special waste stream that looks promising
151,"C&D was a bit of a â€“ kind of, I wouldn't say a disappointment, because it was expected after the hurricanes, but C&D was definitely impacted by the hurricanes"
152,It's coming off of a small base
153,"And when you don't take in C&D material for a period of two weeks to three weeks in two big C&D markets, Florida and Texas, that affects C&D"
154,So we think C&D will return to more kind of normal numbers
155,MSW we talked about
156,And then on the collection side we're very encouraged with the commercial line of business
157,"That's been performing very well for us, continues to perform well when we look at the month of October"
158,"Resi has been the one that has been negative for us, it's the only one that's been negative for us"
159,"and we continue to focus on that,"
160,"on improving the residential line of business, it's an important line of business for us"
161,"We've made some progress there, but still negative and need to continue to work on it"
162,"Corey, it's about â€"
163,“ 10 basis points of CPI equates to about $0.01 per share for us
164,"Based on the most recent 12 months, we've seen about 10 basis points, I mean a little more, about 12 basis points improvement in CPI and"
165,so that will equate to about $0.01 per share in 2018.
166,Yeah
167,"So, just the title itself, we felt like Chief Digital Officer was probably more representative of the job that Nikolaj was going to do coming in"
168,It felt a little bit more like kind of a 21st Century title than a 20th Century title
169,So that's why we changed it a bit
170,"But, I mean, look I would tell you that Nikolaj has a big job in front of him, because it's such an important part of our growth strategy, and it includes things like customer facing technologies, both internal customers and external customers"
171,We tend to think solely about external customers and it's both
172,It's the use of big data
173,We've talked a bit about predictive maintenance and how we're already starting down that path and it's already starting to show some promise
174,"And then asset management technologies, there is a whole list of things that I think you'll see this Chief Digital Officer position and Nikolaj in that role, really start to leverage"
175,"We visited our national accounts group last week and look, national accounts competes against kind of low margin, low frills brokers all the time"
176,"And what we're doing is putting some advanced analytics to use and rolling out a sophisticated reporting tool that really separates us, that differentiates us from those low margin low frills guys"
177,Those are all technologies and difference kind of under that big technology umbrella that that we hope to help differentiate us in the coming years
178,Well
179,"So, we've said for this year at least, 50 basis points to 100 basis points of margin improvement on the EBITDA margin line"
180,"Going forward, we haven't kind of nailed those down yet, but we did say, we still believe that we have margin expansion opportunities either on the gross margin line or down at the EBITDA margin line in 2018"
181,and we'll be more specific about that in February
182,And then what was the second part of your question?
183,"Sure, no, recycling certainly is still on the list and we have done a couple of small strategic recycling acquisitions"
184,They tend to be really almost exclusively where we have either not had a presence or where we can really
185,â€
186,"“ where we're buying into a recycling business that is a strong return, strong business, strong margin business"
187,"There are a couple of places, specifically in Florida, also in Tennessee where I think we bought recycling operations over the past two years"
188,"And so, it is certainly still on the list for us as are some of the other kind of ancillary businesses that are not necessarily straight down the middle of the fairway, core solid waste"
189,"But for the most part, the $100 million to $200 million range that we've given is going to be comprised more of straight down the middle of the fairway, solid waste tuck-ins"
190,And I would just add that that's the really encouraging part about this quarter is â€“ and
191,"really the last several quarters, is that it's really almost been all organic growth"
192,"It has not been driven by acquisitions, nothing wrong with acquisitions, we like acquisitions, but I would tell you that we're growing cash from operations by 13% and EBITDA by 8% or 7% and free cash by 18%"
193,and we're doing it organically
194,and that's the encouraging part about these last couple of earnings
195,reports
196,"Good morning, Barbara"
197,"Okay, thank you"
198,"Well, this was an excellent financial and operating quarter for Waste Management"
199,We're very proud of that
200,"But at the same time we recognize that the hurricanes in Southeast Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and the fires in California have taken a heavy toll on the lives of people who were in the path of those disasters and I tell you, it reemphasizes to all of us, the roles that we play as compassionate human beings and those are truly the most important roles we play each and every day"
201,"So, thank you again for your time today"
202,We'll see you next quarter and go Astros
