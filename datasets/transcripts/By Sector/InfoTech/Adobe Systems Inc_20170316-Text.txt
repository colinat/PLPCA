Thanks Mike and good afternoon
Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with record revenue of $1.68 billion and record profit, GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.94. We continue to execute well against our strategy, and are driving momentum across our entire business
Digital transformation has created a tailwind for Adobe among a diverse spectrum of customers in a broad number of industries, from students, to designers, to the public sector, and the world’s largest brands
Once the domain solely of professionals, today everyone is a creator; from the teenager doing a school photography project; to the small business owner, prototyping her Web site to the film-maker; working on his first documentary; and designers become a critical element in the fabric of our lives
Design is the starting point for every connection we make, and great design requires innovative technology
At the same time, massive amounts of data, the proliferation of devices and skyrocketing customer expectations, are forcing enterprises to completely rethink their business strategies
To forge stronger customer connections that lead to brand loyalty and growth, forward-looking enterprises are reimagining the experience they provide to their customers
At Adobe, we’ve have always known that a great customer experience is the differentiator that separates market leaders from the pack
At the center of every great experience are customer intelligence and amazing design, and these are Adobe’s core competencies
Our mission to help our customers design and deliver great experiences has never been more relevant as is reflected in our outstanding Q1 results
In Digital Media, we continue to be the undisputed leader in helping customers inject creativity into their jobs, schoolwork and their daily lives
We achieved a record $1.14 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q1 and exited the quarter with over $4.25 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR
The net ARR increase in Q1 was $265 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud business
Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creatives the world over and we continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments, and adding value through new services
In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers
This year, two of Adobe’s iconic creative apps are celebrating anniversaries
In March, Adobe Illustrator, the industry-standard vector graphics app that lets you create logos, typography, and complex illustrations for print, web, video, and mobile, celebrated its 30th anniversary
30 years of Illustrator projects are visible everywhere across the world, from billboards on U.S
highways to magazine covers in Tokyo
More than 180 million graphics are created monthly with Illustrator
Earlier this week, we celebrated Premiere Pro’s 25th anniversary
Premiere Pro is the world’s leading video production solution, and continues to grow its footprint across every video segment
Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January
Premiere Pro’s virtual reality workflows are seeing strong adoption with the majority of the films in the Virtual Reality category at Sundance having used it in their creative process
As part of our year-long celebration, we are partnering with the Grammy-award-winning band, Imagine Dragons, which just released the music video for its newest song, Believer
Earlier this week, we announced that creatives in 27 countries will have the chance to take the raw video footage from the original video and cut their own version
Our Adobe Stock service business continues to accelerate
In the past year, we have grown Adobe Stock assets to more than 60 million and in January, we announced a partnership with 500px, a global online photography community, which expands Adobe Stock’s Premium collection
The world’s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud enables businesses to reinvent inefficient paper-based processes
In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $196 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $493 million
Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined, again grew double-digits year-over-year
This achievement was driven by new customer acquisition with our subscription model and the funnel of users created by the broad use of PDF and the proliferation of Adobe Reader across mobile devices
In February, in conjunction with the Cloud Signature Consortium, we unveiled the world’s first open cloud-based digital signature standard, available in any browser and on any device
We announced new functionality in Adobe Sign that enables users to create end-to-end business workflows, such as advanced document routing, online collaboration and Microsoft SharePoint integration
Adobe Sign now includes mobile tools, powered by Adobe Sensei, for scanning, reading, routing and signing documents
Deep intelligence fueled by trillions of data transactions are the foundation of our Digital Marketing business
We drove a record $477 million in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue in Q1, which was 26% year-over-year revenue growth
Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to lead the category and be the most comprehensive offering for global brands, government agencies and institutions that need to deliver personal, consistent and relevant experiences to their audiences everywhere and every time they connect with them
Adobe Marketing Cloud features best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaign management and media optimization
We managed more than 100 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past year across our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions
In February, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs research report
For the third consecutive time, Adobe was ranked the highest in completeness of vision axis among the 22 companies that were evaluated
Also in Q1, Adobe was recognized as a Leader in the Forrester Wave report on Web Content Management systems, receiving the highest score
Thanks to the completeness of our offering, our continued innovation and our growing partner network, we continue to see strong market momentum, with major customer wins this quarter at Dick’s Sporting Goods, Mercy Health, Hutchison UK, Autotrader
com, Computer Sciences Corporation, ADT and the University of Michigan
In December, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a leader in demand-side video advertising
We achieved strong Q1 TubeMogul revenue, and we are hard at work integrating TubeMogul with our current Adobe Media Optimizer solution
As a combined advertising solution, we will enable Adobe’s customers to optimize their video, search and display advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV
Next week in Las Vegas, we will conduct our largest Adobe Summit ever, with more than 12,000 attendees, including more than 1,000 of our global partners
Executives from top brands, including the NBA, National Geographic, T-Mobile and Facebook will take the stage and we’ll give an update on our strategic partnership with Microsoft
We’re continuing to aggressively invest in the Adobe Cloud Platform and Adobe Sensei, our unified artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and intelligent services
Our trillions of content and data assets, along with our deep category expertise in the markets we serve, give Adobe Sensei a unique ability to help customers tackle complex experience challenges
We plan to unveil new Adobe Sensei capabilities at Adobe Summit
We will also provide an update on our adobe
io capabilities for partners, ISVs and developers, who can utilize our open platform to develop their own applications
This level of innovation can only come from talented, creative and dedicated employees
Last month, we held our internal Tech Summit where we announced our commitment to train every one of our technical employees in artificial intelligence fundamentals
We also demonstrated the incredible work happening across the Company
Last month, we were included on Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list, and last week we were honored to be named to the Fortune Best Places to Work list for the 17th year
Adobe would not be the Company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future
I would like to thank all our employees for the role they play in our continued success
To create an exceptional customer experience, you need a potent combination of deep intelligence and amazing design
These are our unique capabilities, and our opportunity has never been greater
We have the technology leadership, partner ecosystem and customer relationships, to fundamentally reshape how individuals, brands and institutions transform themselves in the 21st century
Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe
Mark?
Sterling, I’ll take that question
I think we’re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well
As you know that’s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering
And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter
I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter that’s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud
In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention
And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well
And also, there is no question that we’re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes
So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings
And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks
So, that continues to be strong as well
You’re absolutely right
I think big picture, the conversations that we’re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda
And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge
And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind
And we're part of all of those conversations
I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people
But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do
But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution
Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise
As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs
And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new
And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past
As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services
So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services
And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well
To your point, stock had a good quarter
We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory
Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding
And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value
And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well
It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise
There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it’s ever been
So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits
I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us
And the expectation is that’s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery
So, we’re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, it’s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in
Let me take the second first, which is, you’ll get an update as well as Summit
So we’re hoping a lot of will be at Summit
I think you’ll be pleased with how quickly we’ve been able to integrate the products
And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven
Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics
And I think the team has done a great job
But next week we’ll give you a little bit of an update on that
On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about
This is a $40 billion TAM
Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity
But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that we’re strong continues to be excellent
I think we have a differentiated solution
And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader
But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith
The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products
I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop
So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product
So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest
The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory
So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market
And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide
And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that’s out there
Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right
So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it
Now, I think in all three of those, we’re continuing to make great progress
And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant
It’s an area we’ll continue to invest in
So, we feel good about it Derrick
You’re absolutely right
The good news is we’re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products
I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas
Where we think we have a world class organization that does that
Because it’s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we’re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects
So I actually feel good about all of those
In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that’s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that
So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we’ve invested in over the last few years
We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies
And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we’re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense
And so we have done some when they make sense
But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we’ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense
I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about
If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs
And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions
And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we’re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services
And the service that is top of mind for as Stock
So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on
And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business
But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we’re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we’ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves
And I think we’ll continue to be unique in that, we’re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings
We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever
We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision
But thank you for joining us today
