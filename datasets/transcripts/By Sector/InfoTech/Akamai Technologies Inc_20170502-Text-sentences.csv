0,"Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone"
1,"As Tom highlighted, Q1 was another solid quarter for Akamai with both revenue and earnings coming in at the high end of our guidance range"
2,"Revenue in the first quarter was $609 million, up 7% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, and up 13% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers"
3,"Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter"
4,Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1.
5,"We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings"
6,"Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines with particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions"
7,"First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year"
8,Our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million
9,"We are pleased with the continued strong growth and execution of our Cloud Security business, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas, like bot management and Enterprise Application Access"
10,"And we plan to further broaden our performance, security and enterprise offerings where we see substantial long-term growth potential"
11,"And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value"
12,"Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers"
13,"This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably"
14,"It is important to note that while the pricing environment in the Media business remains highly competitive, aggregate price per bit declines remain roughly within historical norms"
15,"As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities"
16,"And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online"
17,"Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year"
18,"Turning now to our Q1 revenue results by customer division, revenue from our Web Division customers was $305 million, up 15% year-over-year"
19,"We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with Cloud Security offerings"
20,"Revenue from our Media Division customers was $285 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 11%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers"
21,This growth rate was lower than 2016 levels driven by the moderation in media traffic that I mentioned earlier
22,"Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $19 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year"
23,"Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 33% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4 levels"
24,"International market revenue was $203 million in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region"
25,Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis
26,Revenue from our U.S
27,"market was $407 million, up 2% year-over-year"
28,The large Internet platform customers who are based in the U.S
29,continued to weigh heavily on the U.S
30,market growth rates
31,"Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels and the same period last year"
32,"GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with the same period last year"
33,GAAP operating expenses were $288 million in the quarter
34,"These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items"
35,"Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $228 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels, but above our guidance range, driven by higher commissions and performance incentives as well as increased recruiting-related spend associated with an uptick in hiring activity"
36,"Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $241 million, down $6 million from Q4 levels, due to seasonal revenue declines, and up $7 million from the same period last year"
37,"Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 39%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from Q1 last year and within our guidance range"
38,GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $87 million in the first quarter
39,"These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense"
40,"Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $75 million, up slightly from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance"
41,"Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $165 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines and up $1 million from the same period last year"
42,"Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range"
43,"Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $5 million, up slightly from Q4 levels"
44,Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million
45,"As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results"
46,"Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $81 million or $0.46 of earnings per diluted share"
47,"Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share and at the high end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement"
48,"For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%"
49,Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%
50,"Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 175 million shares, unchanged from Q4 levels and down 2 million shares from Q1 of last year"
51,Now I'll review some balance sheet items
52,"Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up four days from Q4 levels and down two days from the same period last year"
53,"Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million and at the midpoint of our guidance"
54,Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $143 million in the first quarter
55,"Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter"
56,"If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is just under $900 million"
57,"During the quarter, we spent $72 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.1 million shares"
58,"As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program"
59,"Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders"
60,"In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company"
61,"Before we look ahead to Q2, I wanted to spend just a minute on our recent Investor Summit"
62,"For those of you that joined us in person or via the webcast, the themes we shared this year were the same as in prior years"
63,"There has been a level of consistency in what we've talked about every year, the favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the Akamai platform, the leadership position we maintain and the very rapidly changing and evolving cloud ecosystem and a tremendous amount of innovation we've seen across the business and new product adjacencies as well as continued enhancements within our existing core offerings"
64,"Innovation is alive and well across all the divisions, and we believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating growth back to double-digits for the company"
65,The fundamentals of our business remain strong
66,We're continuing to innovate rapidly
67,"And while our investments in new adjacencies will pressure margins in the near term, we believe they will drive significant future top-line and bottom-line growth"
68,"As I said at the Investor Summit, we are committed to balancing both top-line and bottom-line over the long term"
69,"And I certainly believe that if we continue to execute, we will remain a compelling investment proposition for investors"
70,"Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably"
71,While it is also possible that Media growth rates moderate in the back half of 2017 as well
72,", we remain bullish in the medium- to long-term growth prospects for this business, especially the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online"
73,"Factoring in the anticipated moderation of Media growth, we are expecting overall Q2 revenue in the range of $597 million to $609 million"
74,"At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% in constant currency, consistent with Q1 levels and up 2 points from Q2 2016 levels"
75,"At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of $6 million compared to Q2 of last year and a positive impact of $3 million sequentially"
76,"At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76%"
77,"Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $235 million to $241 million, up roughly $10 million sequentially at the midpoint"
78,"This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition"
79,Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations
80,"I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 37%"
81,"And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth"
82,"We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth"
83,"We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017."
84,"As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business"
85,"Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $77 million to $79 million"
86,"Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24% for Q2."
87,And with the overall revenue and spend configuration
88,"I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61."
89,This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%
90,This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 174 million shares
91,"On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $115 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter"
92,"This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity"
93,"In summary, I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai and our ability to execute on our plans for the long term"
94,"Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions"
95,Operator?
96,Question-and-Answer Session
97,"Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business"
98,So that has not changed
99,Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business
100,"Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter"
101,So it was relatively strong in January
102,and then it moderated in February
103,and then it moderated further in March
104,"And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations"
105,"But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term"
106,"And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times"
107,"But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company"
108,"Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers"
109,"I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%"
110,"And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company"
111,"The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens"
112,So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned
113,"Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business"
114,And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges
115,and you start to see media accelerate
116,So it's not uncommon to go through these periods
117,"But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming"
118,"That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent"
119,So we're bullish about the prospects for media
120,"I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media"
121,I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance
122,We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers
123,And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%
124,"So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming"
125,"We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services"
126,So I think what you're going to see here in the guide
127,is you kind to do it at the midpoint
128,"At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about"
129,"Well, let me start"
130,and then I can have
131,– Tom can talk a little about the products
132,I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and
133,then the low-40%s
134,and now they're in the high 30%s
135,This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million
136,Five years ago this was just a idea
137,"So this business is growing very, very rapidly"
138,"Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base"
139,"So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business"
140,"And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings"
141,This is not license model
142,This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion
143,"So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there"
144,"Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those"
145,Those were more technology tuck-ins
146,"There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions"
147,"No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets"
148,"And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets"
149,"We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe"
150,"They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA"
151,And that's probably not uncommon
152,We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated
153,And you could take the OTT question
154,"No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be"
155,"And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected"
156,"So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows"
157,"and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic"
158,And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx
159,"Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx"
160,"The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation"
161,So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow
162,Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections
163,I'll take those
164,"and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer"
165,"So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half"
166,"I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable"
167,"And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers"
168,And so we don't want to curtail investment there
169,"And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case"
170,I think we're really talking about Media in particular
171,"I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA"
172,"There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly"
173,And I forgot what your second question was?
174,Yeah
175,So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018.
176,That's still where we believe we can be
177,You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon
178,So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens
179,"But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again"
180,So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits
181,"I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them"
182,"And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making"
183,"And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company"
184,I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly
185,"You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly"
186,That's a bit of the nature of the Media business
187,And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates
188,I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company
189,"I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about"
190,"And it's been that way for a long, long time"
191,"In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier"
192,The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past
193,and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities
194,"But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers"
195,"And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters"
196,"The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves?"
197,I don't think so
198,I think it's going in the other direction
199,"Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before"
200,I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward
201,So I don't see that's an issue
202,"Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure"
203,"And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery"
204,So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward
205,"If anything, it's going in the other direction"
206,"With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease"
207,"And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens"
208,"You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic"
209,"So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels"
210,"I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price"
211,"On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps"
212,And the best part is we've got a lot of new products
213,"There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager"
214,", there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile"
215,"So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base"
216,And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products
217,We don't actually report customer count
218,We have done that for some time
219,So really not much to comment there
