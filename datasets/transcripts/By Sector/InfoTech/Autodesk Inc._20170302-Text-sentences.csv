0,Thanks Andrew
1,"All of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details"
2,"So I'm not going to walk through them all, but I do want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items and talk about our business outlook for fiscal 2018."
3,Starting with revenue total direct revenue for the fourth quarter increased once again and represented 32% of total revenues
4,That's up from 23% in Q4 last year and just 19% two years ago
5,That's a lot of progress over a relatively short period of time as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as on our e-store
6,As we indicated we believe there is still room for our direct business to grow over the next few years as we progress on the model transition
7,"Moving to spend management, we're really proud of what we've accomplished on the expense side"
8,We started the year with a goal of keeping non-GAAP spend flat to down 1%
9,we ended up reducing it by 3% for the fiscal year and 4% in the fourth quarter
10,We accomplish this by making sure we're investing in critical elements of our transition by reducing standard other areas
11,"Part of the reduction this year was the result of the restructuring we announced at the beginning of the year, coupled with a relentless focus on driving efficiencies across the organization"
12,We significantly reduced our M&A activity this year and we've been simplifying the product portfolio
13,We remain committed to keeping spend flat through fiscal 2019 and believe that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company
14,"During this stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue"
15,Total deferred revenue grew 18% against the tough compare last year when we attached very high percentage of maintenance contracts along with the last sale of perpetual licenses for individual products
16,"As I mentioned in December, the work we've been doing over the past several quarters on our operating structure has allowed us to move about $1.7 billion of our offshore cash into foreign subsidiaries that are branches of Autodesk U.S"
17,If we look at our cash balance at quarter end approximately 85% can be used without incremental U.S
18,tax that equates to $1.9 billion
19,Of course we need to keep some of our cash for operating needs
20,but we intend to put the majority of it into our stock buyback program and execute on that over the next several quarters using both programmatic and opportunistic means
21,We've been increasing our buyback this year and in Q4 we repurchased 2.9 million shares
22,For the year we repurchased nearly10 million shares resulting in a reduction of over 4 million
23,We're making steady progress on this front and over the past two years of reduced our basic share count by about 3%
24,Overall we're extremely pleased with our Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 results
25,"We have increased confidence of the transition is working for our customers, for our partners and for Autodesk"
26,and they were on track for the fiscal 2020 targets we set
27,"I turn now to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well, but many of the emerging markets have been challenging"
28,"We continue to monitor for changes in Europe stemming from Brexit, but today we have not experienced any impact"
29,With the new administration in the U.S
30,"it's far too early to determine any impact from proposed policy changes around tax reform, trade in tariffs, infrastructure spend or whatever the next executive order might be"
31,"As we look ahead to fiscal 2018, it will be our first full-year in the subscription only model and as such we believe it's prudent to take an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets"
32,Here our primary financial goals were resetting for fiscal 2018.
33,We're projecting the total ARR growth will increase to between 24% and 26%
34,"Subscription additions are projected to increase by 600,000 to 650,000, which equates to about a 20% increase"
35,"Bear in mind, that the sales team focus that goes into the maintenance to subscription"
36,"program Andrew discussed earlier will drive higher lifetime values from those who convert, but will not drive any additional subscription adds"
37,Spending will be about flat and we expect the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90% beginning in Q1.
38,"As we look at our outlook for Q1, keep in mind that total ARR growth and subscription additions will build over the course of the year"
39,Another item that I mentioned in December is that we are working to further improve the transparency of our revenue reporting
40,"As such starting in the first quarter, we are planning to have three revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance, and one for other revenue"
41,"In this format, all new model subscription revenue will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be reported in the maintenance line, any remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as other revenue"
42,"To alleviate the need for the recon table, we've been including in prepared remarks and should significantly improve the link between our financials and our business model transition"
43,"In this format, subscription revenue times four will equal new model AAR, maintenance revenue times four will equal maintenance ARR, and you'll be able to better isolate the non-recurring revenues that flow into the other revenue lines"
44,One side effect of this change to call out is that a changes the impact to our ARR calculation to include a couple of small legacy products
45,"We apply this methodology to our fiscal 2017 results, our total ARR would have been about $40 million higher"
46,"We have factored this change into our guidance assumptions for fiscal 2018, so that we are comparing apples-to-apples"
47,And we will give you visibility to all of fiscal 2017 with the small tweak
48,"To wrap things up, we've executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on the success as we head into fiscal 2018 and the next stage of our transition"
49,I want to thank our employees and partners who have worked so hard to make last year a success
50,"I also want to recognize Carl Bass for his leadership and tireless service to Autodesk over the past 20 plus years, and we look forward to his continued input as the special advisor over the next few months and an ongoing board member"
51,"As we undergo the CEO transition, both Andrew and Amar have our full confidence to lead the Company to continued success"
52,"Operator, we’d now like to open up the call for questions"
53,Question-and-Answer Session
54,And Heather within that the strength comes from BIM 360 largely followed by Fusion and then shotgun
55,So it was a very strong quarter
56,", it's good to see the cloud products which will be key to kind of the second wave of the transition that the cloud products begin to take off"
57,"In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point"
58,"well it's – we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base"
59,and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs
60,and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out
61,"Yes, Sterling said another way"
62,The price for maintenance after the 5% uplift is exact same price they would pay if they converted to subscriptions incentive
63,So it's from a modeling standpoint for fiscal 2018 at the same whether they convert or not
64,"Ken, I don't think we can project that"
65,What we'd say is that the 73K number was as expected
66,This was our largest pool of maintenance customers up for renewal and our renewal rate was exactly where we'd expect them to be
67,So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us
68,"So we will get better at tracking every single customer that goes from column A to column B, especially as we do the maintenance and subscription program"
69,But I think there was nothing unusual about this 73K number that we saw
70,"Ken, if you look at the seasonality of where we typically sold licenses, which is when the maintenance agreements will expire, right"
71,It’s
72,an annual maintenance agreement when you sold the license becomes the same quarter that maintenance comes through
73,The two biggest quarters for that are Q4 and Q1.
74,"So 73,000 in Q4 as Amar said was really – churn rate was right in line with our expectations, it is a big quarter in Q1 of renewal opportunities"
75,"In Q4, there's another big opportunity for renewals in Q1 as well"
76,"So obviously we're not guiding to that level of granularity, but it's not on line with what I would expect to see just based on the size of the renewal opportunity"
77,"Kash, we're not providing that level of granularity under new model, but as always happens in Q4."
78,Q4 and Q1 are the biggest quarters for enterprise subscription
79,"adds, Q4 because we sell the most EBA"
80,’s
81,and then they come on line throughout the quarter
82,"Q1 is where we typically get the catch up because as you recall of EBA’s, we actually measure the active users because it’s a consumption model that's not a named user model, we haven't measure the active users and that takes 60 days before we can report those"
83,"So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base"
84,"And then to the second part of your question Rob, on 606."
85,I could have probably actually let Amar that as well because he has been into it up to his eyeballs
86,We are not expecting it to have any impact
87,and I think I mentioned to you last time we met
88,and I've said it
89,"a couple of times, the person is now our System Controller, used to run our rev ops team and has been a member of the AICPA task force on 606 for a couple of years"
90,So we've had great insight into where this is headed and kind of how it's going to be interpreted and how the guidelines will be applied and going through what we're going through the business model transition
91,The last thing we wanted just to get to the end of this and have all that revenue flip back to upfront
92,So we've been working this for quite some time
93,and I think Andrew just mentioned and Amar did as well
94,"We've built in into our products subscription, a fair amount of integrated cloud functionality such that a significant amount of the value comes not just from the executables that come down to the endpoint, but from the interaction with the cloud services"
95,And so we're quite confident that we're going to have a nominal impact from 606.
96,Yes
97,So good question
98,", I mean look"
99,I think our unit volume for this year was right where we expected it to be
100,"and I think our growing momentum based on the factors that Andrew touched upon, we are certainly seeing increasing momentum through license compliance to what we would have called a legacy customer base"
101,"And one of the places where we are definitely accelerating acquisition of customers is also the cloud and as regions around the world whether they are emerging countries or places in Asia they come back to better economic health, they will contribute to this sort of overall unit volume growth"
102,That's why we're very confident that the momentum we're carrying into this year combined with license compliance legacy as well as momentum in cloud as well as the changes that we talked about in the product that really drive customers to be more current
103,They're all factors that we believe will drive that result that we pointed to
104,"Yes, so one of the reasons we structured the program the way we did is we were really focused on minimizing the churn off of that maintenance base"
105,"So we feel that the way we structured the program, the huge incentives for loyalty that we're giving the maintenance customers is really a churn minimization plan"
106,So we're feeling pretty confident
107,"Our competitors have historically tried to make incursions into our installed base as we move to subscription, but the truth of the matter is none of them have been particularly successful"
108,and it's really hard to compete with software that that prices and accessibility levels that are far below what they've been historically when you come in with more expensive perpetual software
109,So yes competitors try to make encourage their incursions
110,They haven't been successful and I think we structured this program as a churn minimization program with a primary goal
