0,"Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning"
1,We appreciate your interest in ADP
2,"This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results, with revenue growth up 6%, both for the quarter and the year"
3,"Revenue for the year was up 7% on an organic basis, benefiting from a solid 6% client growth and from the continued strong performance of our downmarket, PEO, and multinational solutions"
4,"In line with expectations, our new business bookings declined 7% this quarter and 5% for the year"
5,"While we are disappointed with this year's overall bookings performance, it's important to look at the underlying dynamics"
6,The clients were concentrated in our mid- and upmarkets and the challenges were due in large part to growing over the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act
7,"Despite these challenges, the sales opportunities within the mid and upmarkets continue to demonstrates a solid environment with positive growth prospects"
8,"We continue to be very pleased with the momentum and performance of our downmarket and the PEO, both of which continue to demonstrate the value of a broad-based portfolio of solutions"
9,"During fiscal 2017, we increased our head count investments in our sales organization to better position us for growth during fiscal 2018 and beyond"
10,"As the tightening labor market creates additional demand for human capital management solutions, we expect these investments to help us further grow due to the effects of the regulatory uncertainty that prevail within the mid and upmarket since the November U.S"
11,Election
12,"Accordingly, as we return to a more normalized growth trend, we expect fiscal 2018 new business bookings to grow 5% to 7%, gradually expanding back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year"
13,We remain confident in the strength of our distribution capabilities and the competitiveness of our products
14,"And in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities"
15,"Client satisfaction continues to improve, retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are pleased with our progress in upgrading our clients to our latest cloud-based solutions"
16,"This quarter, we are also pleased to see retention improvements across all our market segments with retention improving by 60 basis points and finishing ahead of our expectations"
17,"Our full-year retention was down 50 basis points to 90%, which also includes a 20 basis point impact from the loss of the Office of Personnel Management contract in the first quarter of fiscal 2017."
18,Please note that this contract was part of the CHSA business that we subsequently disposed-off during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
19,I would also like to remind you that the loss is contributing to our annual decline in retention remain concentrated on our legacy platforms in the mid- and upmarkets
20,Our excellent retention performance in the downmarket and improving performance in the midmarket reinforces our core belief that our focused and steady upgrade strategy is the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP in the long-term
21,"Core to our philosophy and value proposition is our commitment to developing innovative ways to enhance not only our clients, product, and service experience but also that of our strategic partners"
22,"Last quarter, we mentioned the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect, where we are leveraging the scale of our strong 510,000-plus client base downmarket to create a compelling value – to create compelling value for our referral partners"
23,"This unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll, including reporting and tax information for our shared clients"
24,It also enables our accountant partners to deepen their relationship with our shared clients by giving them greater insight into payroll data and helps them plan and manage labor costs more efficiently
25,Adoption of Accountant Connect has been strong
26,"We now have more than 8,000 accounting firms using the platform, which is making life easier for the accountants and the clients we share"
27,"This is helping to deepen relationships with an important source of referral business, while increasing our value proposition for RUN clients"
28,"We are incredibly pleased with the adoption of the platform by our accountant partners, and we're also especially pleased that we recently received the Accounting and Tax Technology Innovation Award (sic)"
29,[Tax & Accounting Technology Innovation Award] (6:39) by CPA Practice Advisor
30,ADP's success is rooted in part on our ability to help clients manage through regulatory change
31,"This is especially true from our PEO, ADP TotalSource, which served more than 485,000 average worksite employees this quarter"
32,The value proposition of the PEO gets stronger as the complexities of managing the workforce increase and expectations of employees evolve
33,Great PEOs are built to adapt to these dynamics and help clients navigate these changes
34,And we believe that our PEO is the clear market leader in both the breadth and depth of service
35,"In June, Internal Revenue Service named ADP TotalSource one of the first certified professional employer organizations"
36,"We're proud to be among the first PEOs to receive this important new designation, which certify that ADP adheres to the highest standards"
37,"Becoming a certified PEO, further distinguishes ADP and is a another example of the lengths to which we are willing to go to ensure our clients know they're working with a trusted partner"
38,"As our clients' needs have grown globally, so have our capabilities and our reach"
39,"And today, we are supporting clients in more than 110 countries around the world"
40,"Success in the HCM market on a global scale is not easy to achieve, given the complexities of doing business in many different countries and the local knowledge and understanding that is required to support clients"
41,"Constellation Research, a strategic advisory firm, recently recognized this by naming ADP GlobalView HCM to the Constellation ShortList for Human Capital Management Suites for the second consecutive quarter"
42,Constellation evaluated more than 25 global HCM platforms to determine the top five best-of-breed vendors
43,"In naming ADP to the ShortList, Constellation recognized us for the depth of our global compliance expertise"
44,Noting that behind the global view product were local compliance experts on the ground monitoring and interpreting legislative changes that affect the more than 14 million clients we support outside the U.S
45,This global reach remains a truly differentiating capability for ADP and continues to meaningfully contribute to our growth
46,"In closing, we're pleased with our ability to response to the challenges we faced in fiscal 2017."
47,"This year, we began to see signs that are improving service metrics and our progress on client upgrades are helping to drive improvements and retention"
48,"At the same time, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization in our mid- and upmarkets new business bookings performance as we lap the difficult fiscal 2016 compares and the fiscal 2017 effects of regulatory uncertainty following the U.S"
49,Election
50,"These dynamics, together with a continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, downmarket offerings, and the PEO, give us confidence heading into fiscal 2018."
51,ADP is built for the long haul
52,"Consistent with our long-term objectives, and consistent with conversations we've had with shareholders, we'll continue to leverage the strength of our business model and our proven ability to execute by making smart investments that enhance our service capabilities, our sales force and deliver best-in-class cloud solutions"
53,"We believe these efforts will continue to drive sustained long-term success for our clients, our associates and our shareholders"
54,"And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who'll review our fiscal 2017 results in more detail and share our fiscal 2018 outlook"
55,Good morning
56,"Well, I think as we've said in our comments, the midmarket, the PEO, multinational have all been quite strong"
57,"And really, especially, in a downmarket, as we mentioned, has been really no impact from this grow-over issue with ACA"
58,"So, we've, I think, had what I would consider to be the best results in several years in that space in the downmarket"
59,"In the midmarket, obviously, we had a very significant grow-over, given the strong sales for ACA products in 2016."
60,"But as we've kind of checked in with the sales force throughout the year, and frankly, continue to make investments to keep their heads in the game, we've maintained our turnover at almost exactly the same rate it was in the prior year, which is a very encouraging sign because, obviously, it was a very tight labor market"
61,"So, my worry was given our performance, we might lose some of our sales force"
62,"But I think it's a sign of, I think, optimism on the part of the sales force that there is really no issue with the economy or with our products or competitively or with pricing that it's really just unfortunately a mathematical issue that got aggravated by some of this uncertainty that came out of Washington, which really stop people from buying not only – or slowed the sales of ACA to a much lower level than we had planned, but I think just created some kind of short-term uncertainty after November"
63,"I think in the upmarket, we did, I think, feel after November that there was some elongation in terms of decision-making, which is a little more logical because you have relatively sophisticated buyers there"
64,"And I think some were probably waiting to see what would happen with the regulatory environment, given that there was talk of repealing ACA and repealing a number of other regulations within weeks, as we all know that hasn't happened"
65,"And so, I think gradually things feel like they've gotten a little bit better and things have loosened up a bit"
66,"But as we know from what's going on in Washington yesterday and today, I think in that space in particular, I think there's still, I think some probably wait and see on the part of buyers"
67,At least in our experience with our products
68,"And I think if I you stick to like looking at 'our adjusted results,' then you shouldn't even worry about it for next year because the dual ops incremental expenses is minimal"
69,"So, there's really nothing to worry about"
70,"By the way, those – that will be two years of – so we had a step up of – and it was a 20 basis point impact of dual ops this year"
71,"Next year, it's about the same level of expense"
72,"and then it should fall off, obviously, in the following year"
73,But the restructuring costs themselves for the Strategic Alignment Initiative are non-GAAP
74,"And so you shouldn't have to, I think, worry too much about trying to figure out the analysis there"
75,Because should not be – should not enter into the picture
76,"Other than, obviously, we're incredibly excited about what is going to be the outcome of the Strategic Alignment Initiative down the road"
77,"Well, I think that it's obviously very early"
78,We're about halfway through in terms of the hiring plans
79,"So I would say that, I think, we joke around"
80,that I think this is the easy part
81,"So putting buildings up and hiring people, we definitely accomplished it"
82,And we're right on track in terms of – and on schedule in terms of our objectives
83,We feel like we've gotten some great people
84,We've got great engagements
85,"Obviously, they're in the process of being trained"
86,"So, I think all systems, so far, we haven't seen anything to indicate that our expectations that we had of the project are going to be anything other than what we expected"
87,So we're very excited that we've been able to kind of stay on track
88,But I think it's a little early to really declare victory
89,"But we're very optimistic as this, obviously, is going to create a much enhanced experience for our clients, given that we're putting teams in large locations that are, what we call intact, and are able to deliver services across multiple modules rather than just in silos"
90,"Not to mention, obviously, the consolidation effect of having large groups of associates, which we've seen already in two locations that we've had for several years, El Paso and Augusta, creates very, very high engagement, better NPS scores, better client experience, and better associate experience as well"
91,"So, we're very excited"
92,It's obviously a big investment
93,"And fortunately, it's on track as of now"
94,Thank you
95,"And I think the last thing you mentioned, which should also, I think, address is, is it related to pricing, and the answer is not"
96,"For the last several years, we've been trying to gradually bring down our, 'price increase'"
97,And we've done that again this year
98,But it's $5 million to $10 million
99,It's not a big deal on the 'overall gross and net price increase that we passed through to our clients
100,So – but there's no change in pricing in terms of new business or the competitive environment or anything to that effect
101,I think it's really related to the factors that we're seeing that Jan was talking about in terms of some of the revenue growth issues
102,The good news for us is that the scale really starts to pick up again for us in the second half
103,"So if you look at the way this issue has worked with the grow over, part of the confusion might be related to the fact that our fiscal year is in the middle of – obviously, ends in the middle of the year, and the impacts are really calendar-year impacts"
104,"And so, if you go back and you look at quarterly numbers, you will see that we had two strong quarters"
105,"the first half of this fiscal year, and then now we just had two relatively weak quarters because of the grow over issues"
106,"So we will have another two-week quarters because of the grow over issue at the beginning of fiscal 2018, and then our plans are that our sales return to near pre-ACA levels in the second half, as well as our revenue growth begins to once again gradually accelerate"
107,"Now, of course, that means that we have to hit our plans in retention and new business bookings, but that's the way math does work"
108,"Everything we've been telling you, I think, is accurate about the impacts of the grow over of this ACA issue, which were significant"
109,"We've mentioned that the business itself is about $175 million in revenue, which means that we sold about $175 million"
110,"And so that affected our new business bookings, which is what's causing the grow over from new business bookings"
111,"And likewise, the $175 million in revenue, even though it didn't come all in one year, a lot of it did come in January of 2016, which means that from a revenue standpoint, you also have, call it, a point or so of incremental growth that you've picked up from ACA"
112,"And then, obviously, now, from a comparison standpoint, you lose a point"
113,"And that's right about how the math works because on an organic basis, we're at about 7% growth this year, and we were at about 8% last year"
114,"And so our hope is that once we get past the next couple of quarters, that we get back here to business as usual"
115,"I think our strength in particular – and we think we've talked about this for several years, is really our multinational solutions really do appear to be highly differentiated"
116,"And again, multinationals is both very, very large companies with very large populations of employees, but we also have multinational solutions for a company that may be headquartered somewhere in Europe and has 20 employees in four countries in Europe"
117,"So we really go all the way from very, very large Fortune 100 – or world Fortune 100 companies all the way to what I would call local multinationals, if you will, or regional multinationals"
118,And so it's a highly differentiated product
119,"We've had good sales growth over multiple years, double-digit revenue growth, generating great margins because now we've got scale, and the business is –"
120,I would just call it humming along
121,"Our international business, I think, has gotten better on, what I would call, a relative basis, because it's been a difficult backdrop in Europe, which is our largest international business"
122,"We also have a business in APAC and Latin America, but our largest concentration other than Canada in North America is in Europe"
123,"And so that European business on a relative basis, slight improvement in the underlying pays per control"
124,It looks like GDP is starting to pick up a little bit there
125,"Sales, a little bit better this year than we have for the last several years, but I wouldn't say that that business is at the same performance level as the multinational business"
126,"We hope it will be at some point in the near future, but the international business, good, solid performance and really good margin performance as well where that business – 10, 15 years ago, my predecessor, we struggled for years to really get that business to perform as well as the rest of ADP from a margin and ""retention standpoint,"" and I think we're kind of there now"
127,So we've got good leadership
128,and I think the business is performing very well
129,We're very happy with our international and multinational business
130,Multinational – sorry
131,"I think in total is about $500 million, Jan?"
132,Is that
133,And then what we call international
134,So the multinational is $500 million
135,"For rounding purposes, call international $1 billion"
136,"And then Canada, another $400 million"
137,So that's how you get to approximately 20%
138,We are on track on the migrations
139,"I think we did about a couple thousand this quarter, probably 2,500 to 3,000 the previous quarter to that"
140,"So we're kind of in the same general ballpark, which just as a reminder is much lower than it was at its peak when we were in the middle of ACA, because we had a lot of accelerated migrations in order to get clients on the right platforms to be able to do ACA compliance for them"
141,"And then with the benefit of hindsight, that was an issue for us that caused some of our retention challenges"
142,But fortunately that's all behind us now
143,"And now we're back to what we were doing all along for several years, which is migrating clients at the right pace, with the right attention and the right"
144,what we call now white-glove service
145,"We have I think it's 5,000 to 6,000 clients left in the midmarket?"
146,I'm checking for
147,"About 5,000 to 6,000 clients left"
148,"And so you can see that at the pace that we're on now, we have a shot at getting it done by yearend"
149,"We might have, whatever, 500 clients, 1,000 clients left at yearend, that doesn't obviously concern me because we would have done, I think, 60,000 clients"
150,"So if we have to – and again, the way our business works is everything has to stop in the middle of November because of yearend"
151,And everything starts again in February
152,"In other words, the company just becomes focused on getting through the yearend process"
153,"So it could be that we have 500 to 1,000."
154,But it's obviously helping us on a number of fronts because our retention on our strategic platform is much higher than our legacy platform
155,"So as the number of clients gets smaller and smaller, we get a mathematical lift, if you will, just because of the mix issue"
156,"So I think it's – I would say that it's probably not something that will be an enormous amount of focus for all of you going forward, but it is an incredible accomplishment"
157,"Because I was talking to the person who runs R&D for that organization about a week ago, and he named all the platforms that we had 10 years ago when he first went to that business"
158,"And we're down to one platform here, and we're close – almost across the finish line"
159,"So the power that that business is going to have now, the focus – and to focus on the competition and to focus on execution and NPS scores and retention is going to be, I think, equal to what we've done in the downmarket on RUN, and that gets me excited"
160,Sure
161,"I think your math is probably pretty close, directionally close"
162,And that's been obviously why we keep focusing so hard on our service experience and our retention rates because obviously every $10 million that we keep is $10 million less for the competition
163,So that's why you hear us being so keenly focused on retention over the last several quarters
164,"In terms of competitive information, we've said before that we really don't have any one competitor who takes more than 10% of our business, if you will"
165,"So there's really not – and that's been consistent for a long, long time"
166,So there is a lot of competition
167,"So we have a lot of competitors, who operate in multiple segment s"
168,The competitors in the downmarket are different from the midmarket
169,The midmarket is different from the upmarket
170,Some of them bleed across some of those segments
171,"But in general, we have competitors that tend to be more focused on a particular part of the market than us, which are broadly focused"
172,"I think that gives us some advantages, which we leverage in terms of products and service capabilities, et cetera"
173,"But at the end of the day, we are very large, and we obviously are the target for a lot of competition"
174,"In terms of specifics, we do look very deeply on a quarterly basis at win/losses both head-to-head and sales and also in the book"
175,"In other words, clients that we lose to a particular competitor and clients we take away from a particular competitor"
176,In addition to looking at the head-to-head competition from a sales standpoint
177,"And again, this quarter, unfortunately, it's the same story as other quarters, which is there's no discernible pattern other than there were a couple of competitors in particular that we were able to reverse the tide on, which I'm incredibly proud of because as you point out, we have"
178,– there's a few of our competitors that aren't even at the size that you mentioned of $300 million
179,And obviously we are several billion
180,"So whenever you can take the net balance of trade and improve it, it's a big accomplishment, and it shows competitive strength in the products, and it shows execution ability in the sales force as well as on the implementation and on the service side"
181,"So there's some glimmers of hope in the last couple of quarters that when we put our minds to it, we can push back, and I think that having clients all-in-one platform, having ACA behind us, there's a number of factors that I think that give me confidence that that focus will be even more heightened on a going-forward basis"
182,"And that we'll be able to hopefully make that $300 million, $250 million or $200 million and hopefully slow down some of our competitors"
183,Yeah
184,We would like to try to help there
185,And I'll be careful and
186,I'll let Jan do the closing here
187,"Because of the way our business works, it's a recurring revenue business, and events tend to take place at calendar year"
188,ends like they did with ACA
189,So the first two quarters of this fiscal year should not look that different from the first two quarters of this fiscal year from a revenue growth standpoint
190,"If our sales forecasts and our retention forecasts hold true, by the second half of this fiscal year, there will be gradual improvement on the revenue growth"
191,"Likewise, when you look at margins – now, clearly, as Jan said, we've been 'adjusting' our expense base to a lower revenue"
192,"We just didn't want to do it too quickly because we're trying to focus on retention as well, and we mentioned that we're making investments in sales"
193,But there should be some gradual relief of pressure on the margin in the first half of this fiscal year compared to the second half of last fiscal year
194,"But even more, 'relief' and improvement in the second half"
195,And I would call it significant improvement and relief in the second half
196,"And again, that's all mathematical, and it all works that way, and I think that's probably – I said probably more than I should say, and I'll let Jan"
197,"And I think in terms of the relative size of the PEO bookings, I don't know that we don't really give that guidance, but I don't think there's anything wrong with giving you a range of the sales dollars for TotalSource"
198,"are somewhere around – call it 20% to 25% – 20-ish%, if you will, of the total bookings, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit higher than that"
199,"And again, with good growth, obviously that's driving the top line revenue growth"
200,Yeah
201,I shouldn't have done that because Jan is right
202,"If you look the sales at the gross level including the pass-throughs, they would be probably, almost as much as our total bookings, because other PEOs probably may report their sales or the new business bookings that way"
203,"But obviously we, for the sake of comparability and to make sure that it looks like other ADP business as we do exclude the pass-throughs in the way we count it"
204,So I'll add that we had record retention in a couple of other places as well
205,So the PEO had record retention
206,The SBS business in down-market had record retention
207,We had a couple of other places that had record retention as well
208,"And I think that in most of those cases, the only thing I can put my finger on is execution because they are good businesses, and there's a good backdrop"
209,"But for the benefit of hindsight, that's kind of always been true"
210,And I think the one variable seems to be execution
211,"So if we really deliver great products and great service, the clients stay in all of the segments"
212,"And so the retention in SBS, for example, now in the downmarket is 3 to 4 percentage points, not basis points, higher than it was five or six years ago and higher than – and that much higher than we thought we would ever be able to achieve"
213,"And again, I think it's getting all the clients on one platform so that you make all your investments and you put all your focus and all your R&D on one platform"
214,You heard what we were doing with things like Accountant Connect
215,It's very hard to do those things when you have three or four platforms
216,"So having everyone on one platform, going after kind of the friction and the things that create bad service experience and just good execution, all those things, I think you put them together, and it's really created a really great story for us that obviously is translating not only into great retention but great retention in these businesses leads to really great margin performance and really good revenue growth"
217,"So the visibility that we have is related to the number of salespeople we have and their productivity, what we call annual sales productivity"
218,So we have a lot of data and many years of data around that
219,And we know that our productivity jumped dramatically when we had ACA sales and obviously came back down when we didn't have that tailwind
220,But we have ways of getting at the numbers
221,"Having said that, we've said multiple times where it's retention or new business bookings, the amount of visibility we have to that is less than things like revenue next quarter because it's a completely different issue in terms of the recurring revenue, nature of the business makes the revenues, and the margins are somewhat predictable"
222,So new business bookings and retention have less visibility
223,"But we have ways of getting at what we think are the right targets, which I think as you mentioned are much better obviously in the second half"
224,"So again, all things being equal, if the economy cooperates and we continue to execute well and the math holds up historically for ADP, we should be able to get to those numbers"
225,"And obviously, it doesn't happen in a vacuum"
226,You've got to have great products
227,You've got to keep sales force turnover down
228,"Those are kind of the controllables that we focus on that, I think we're doing frankly an exceptional job on right now"
229,"As you are a very correct observer, Jim"
230,"So as an exception in fiscal year 2017, we guided for incremental share buybacks, because we wanted to make – be clear that our intent was to return the proceeds of our debt offering in 2016, which has been completed"
231,"So we're now returning to our normal practice, which is we are anticipating to offset equity based dilution for our employer compensation, which is about $400 million or so"
232,And then we should expect – we're aiming to be back at our long-term model that we have shared
233,And I think the long-term model includes – not that we guide to it – but the long-term model anticipates the return of excess cash to our shareholders of approximately 1% – resulting into approximately 1% of share count reduction
234,"That will be our long-term model and pending on market conditions, obviously"
235,I think it's really too early to read anything into the fourth quarter sales results
236,"Because as Jan just said, we put in incentives to try to get people over the finish line"
237,"We frankly also implored the sales force to ""not give up,"" because we don't want to send the wrong signal to the market or to our competitors"
238,And so there's a lot of moving parts here that I think may have contributed
239,"But it was better than the alternative, so we're happy that we had the finish that we had"
240,"But I don't think that there's really anything you can scientifically read into it, other than maybe underneath the surface"
241,"there's some better environment in terms of the – because some of the uncertainty – I mean, at some point people have to get back to business as usual despite what's going on in Washington with regulation and with ACA and so forth"
242,So maybe there's a little bit of that
243,But we – can't put my finger on it
244,"I wish I could, but our optimism as to your point about why are we optimistic, it relates back to my previous comments around ADP's historical ability to execute in sales related to having the right head count, having the right products, the right sales support, the right incentives, and the right execution"
245,"I think with the right economic backdrop, I think should give me – and it does – a high level of confidence and optimism"
246,"Again, we haven't heard anything in terms of that would change, for example, the way taxes are collected in this country or that would affect our fluid –"
247,I'm not sure exactly maybe where – if there's something you think or you know that we don't know
248,And we're happy to hear about it or address it
249,But we're not aware of anything other than they're trying to reduce the corporate tax rate
250,"And obviously there are some, I guess, preferences and benefits that are going to be taken away in order to do that, but those generally apply to, like, the energy sector, manufacturing sector and other"
251,That's why we have a higher effective tax rate
252,So in theory there are going to be winners and losers
253,The people with very low effective tax rate are going to probably get an increase in their effective tax rate
254,And the people who have a high effective tax rate are going to see a decrease because the statutory corporate tax rate is going to – not going to – they're saying they're going to take it down
255,"So whether it's 25% or 20% or 30%, that can only help us"
256,And we don't have any significant tax preferences that we take advantage of that would go the other way
257,"From a client standpoint, we do have a tax credit business"
258,It's relatively small
259,We haven't heard any talk about – those are targeted job credit-type taxes that are – tax breaks that are very popular
260,"So we haven't heard any talk about that, those being repealed"
261,"I would say it's very likely that if there's any tax reform, that it would be very positive for ADP"
262,It could be significantly positive
263,"But obviously as Jan said, we have no sense of the likelihood of that"
264,"Just to clarify, and I don't want to be misquoted as saying not seeing much change in the competition because we have a lot of competition"
265,And it feels like we have more of it than we had three years or five years ago or 10 years
266,But that probably happens to every CEO
267,They always think that they have more competition than the previous person
268,So we have an enormous amount of respect for the market and for the competition because there's a lot of it
269,And we know that we have to earn our place every day in the marketplace by having competitive products and great service
270,"And whenever we slip or trip, they take advantage"
271,"And whenever they slip or trip, we take advantage"
272,And so it's very important for us to stay on top of it
273,"But if you're asking about 12 months specifically, there are definitely competitors who have gone – who have kind of come down segments or gone up segments"
274,"But I think, based on my experience at ADP, nothing different from what's been happening for decades where a competitor decides if they're in the downmarket, that they can go up into the midmarket"
275,And they try it
276,"and then maybe three years later, they go back, or sometimes they stay"
277,"Likewise, we've always had enterprise-size competitors that are in the upmarket who decide to come downmarket a little bit into the midmarket"
278,Sometimes they go away
279,"So I don't think I've seen anything worth, I guess, reporting"
280,But plenty of that type of stuff that you just mentioned
281,But I think it's normal competitive actions by competitors
282,Thank you very much
283,We appreciate your time today
284,"As you can see, I think these strategic initiatives that we've laid out over the last several years, I think are beginning to deliver on some of the objectives we have around not just shareholder value but also around delivering world-class solutions to our clients"
285,"I'm very proud – it's year-end, so I think I should say that I'm very proud of the hard work and dedication of our associates who obviously have been able to help us deliver these results, including the improvements in the service experience and improvements in retention this quarter"
286,"Obviously, we continue to be excited about the prospects ahead of us"
287,We definitely have challenges in 2018 with a softer bookings performance
288,"And as you can tell, we're incredibly bullish and confident still"
289,Otherwise we wouldn't be making the kinds of investments that we're making
290,"So we believe that these investments, along with our ability to execute, I think, really give us the right formula for sustained, continued success for many years to come"
291,"So thanks again for your interest in ADP, and thank you for joining us on the call today"
