Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone
Before reviewing the quarter and outlook in more detail, I'll make a few callouts to begin
First, guidance
We're reaffirming our fiscal year 2017 guidance this morning, and I will give you a sense on where we expect to land within those ranges
Specific to earnings, we expect adjusted EPS growth will be in the range of 13% to 15% in the middle of our 12% to 17% guidance range
Second, investment gain
In connection with the acquisition of Message Automation, we realized a $9 million investment gain related to our prior ownership stake
For purposes of our adjusted earnings, we deducted this income, dollar for dollar, since it's a non-taxable gain
And third, tax rate
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, which was driven down by the impact of the Message Automation investment gain
Our effective tax rate after adjusting for the gain was 31.3%
Our full-year GAAP tax rate is expected to be 33% or 34%, excluding the Message Automation gain
I will touch on these topics again through my review of the quarter and our outlook
I will now provide a quick recap of our results
Third quarter 2017 recurring fee revenues rose 30% to $592 million; and total revenues rose 46% to $1.01 billion
Adjusted operating income rose 22% to $134 million; and adjusted EPS rose $19% to $0.69 per share; and closed sales rose 66% to $48 million
Let's move to the drivers of our top line growth, which are laid out on page 6 of the presentation
I will start with total revenues and then focus on recurring fee revenues
As I noted, total revenues grew 46% to $1.01 billion
The acquisition of NACC, which occurred on the first day of the first fiscal quarter was the biggest driver of our total growth, contributing $277 million to our revenues
That acquisition drove much of the increase in both recurring revenues and distribution revenues
Event-driven fee revenues, up 26%, were a nice contributor for our growth in the quarter, rising $12 million to $61 million
That increase contributed 2 points to our overall revenue growth in the third quarter
The impact of changes in foreign currency was a slight drag on our reported revenues but less an impact than it has been in recent quarters
Recurring fee revenues grew 30% to $592 million
Excluding the impact of NACC and other acquisitions, organic recurring fee revenue growth was 4% in the third quarter
The biggest driver of our organic growth with the impact of strong closed sales, which accounted for 7 points of growth was partially offset by 2 points of client losses
Internal growth was negative 1%
Excluding the impact of the Accenture Post Trade Processing or APTP recontracted from a year ago, which I will discuss in my comments on the GTO segment results, internal growth would have been neutral, and organic recurring fee revenue growth was at 5%
Our year-to-date revenue figures can be found on page 7. Total revenues rose 45% to $2.8 billion with NACC, again, being the largest driver and with event-driven revenues a drag
Recurring revenues rose 32% to $1.6 billion
Organic growth contributed 5 percentage points to our recurring fee growth over the first nine months, with the balance coming from acquisitions, mostly, NACC
Turning to slide 8. Adjusted operating income rose 22% to $134 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That growth was driven by the acquisition of NACC, organic recurring fee revenue growth, and the impact of higher event-driven revenues
Adjusted operating income margins declined from 15.9% to 13.2%, largely as a result of adding the lower-margin NACC business, partially offset by the increase in event-driven revenue and higher margins in the GTO segment
Adjusted EPS rose 19% to $0.69; and GAAP EPS grew by 21%
There are three items of note that had an impact on EPS
The first was the $9 million non-cash gain, resulting from the acquisition of Message Automation
Because Broadridge owned a minority interest in that company, the acquisition triggered a revaluation of our investment stake, resulting in a one-time non-cash gain, which was not subject to tax
So, all $9 million fell directly through to our reported GAAP earnings and GAAP EPS
While the gain benefited our GAAP EPS, it has been excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS
The second item was the tax rate
Excluding the impact of the Message Automation gain, our tax rate was 31.3% in the third quarter
As we have in recent fiscal third quarters, we recognized one or more discrete items, which had the effect of lowering our third quarter rate that had only a small impact on the forecasted full-year rate
We expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 34%, excluding this gain and 33% with the gain
The third item to point out is the share count
A 1% decline in the weighted average shares outstanding also contributed modestly to our EPS growth
That decline primarily reflects the shares Broadridge repurchased over the past three fiscal quarters
Moving to slide 9. For the nine-month period, our adjusted operating income grew by 16%; and adjusted EPS rose 12%
Turning to slide 10, a review of the performance of our ICS and GTO segments
ICS revenues rose 60% to $826 million in the third quarter, driven largely by the impact of higher recurring fee and distribution revenues from NACC and an increase of event-driven revenues
ICS recurring fee revenues rose 48% to $389 million
On an organic basis, revenues rose 6%, driven entirely by Net New Business
ICS recurring fee revenues benefited from organic growth in our communications business and from growth in data and analytics, tax, and other new product lines
As Rich noted, ICS revenues also benefited from a pickup in ETF and mutual fund interim position growth to 5%, as well as 6% stock record growth
ICS earnings before taxes rose 10% to $74 million from $67 million
The growth in earnings reflects the impact of the NACC acquisition and higher event-driven revenues, which more than offset higher amortization expense related to the NACC and Inveshare technology acquisitions
Next, to GTO
GTO recurring revenues rose 6% to $203 million
Organic growth was 3%, and recent acquisitions contributed another 3%
Breaking down the organic growth, closed sales added 7 points of revenue growth, which netted to 5 points of Net New Business after client losses
The contribution from Net New Business reflects the strong GTO sales results over the last couple of years, including some sales closed in fiscal year 2015. This meaningful lag between sales and revenue recognition highlights the number of larger deals we have been closing
These larger deals are typically more complex and have longer conversion times
Similarly, as we consider the recent record sales results, many of the sales we have closed over the course of this fiscal year will not begin to have an impact on reported revenues until late fiscal 2018, 2019, and in some cases, even 2020. The growth in revenue attributed to Net New Business was offset by negative 2 points of internal growth
Our general growth comparison was impacted by the recognition of $4 million of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 related to the recontracting of a single APTP contract
Excluding the impact of that revenue, internal growth would've been modestly positive; and GTO organic growth would've been 5%
GTO earnings before taxes rose 10% to $44 million, as we continue to realize positive operating leverage, especially for Net New Business
Moving on to slide 11. Broadridge's annual free cash flow generation is typically weighted to the second half of the year, and I expect fiscal 2017 to follow the same pattern
Broadridge generated $130 million in free cash flow in the third quarter and $93 million year-to-date
We continue to expect to achieve our guidance for the full-year free cash flow of $350 million to $400 million, inclusive of unusually high capital expenditures
At this point, we expect to be in the lower half of that range
Broadridge will continue to balance smart investments in its business with returning capital to shareholders
During the third quarter, we invested $38 million in capital expenditures and software spend and spent $20 million net of cash to acquire Message Automation, adding to the compliance capabilities of our GTO business
We also want to maintain an efficient and lean capital structure
So, as our cash flow picked up, we increased our share repurchase activity
In total, Broadridge repurchased 1.6 million shares for an average price of $69. That brought our quarter-end outstanding share count to 117.1 million
That capital return was in addition to the $40 million return with the quarterly dividend
Now, let's turn to our fiscal year 2017 guidance, which can be found on slide 12. We are reaffirming our guidance for the full year
We continue to expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 40% to 42%
We now expect our event-driven revenues to be higher in the fourth quarter than they were a year ago, as some of the meaningful mutual fund proxy event-driven activity for calendar year 2017, which we highlighted in our February call, is now likely to occur on fiscal fourth quarter
The increase in event-driven revenue, along with associated distribution revenues, is likely to push our reported fiscal 2017 revenues closer to high end of the projected full-year range
For recurring fee revenues, we were reaffirming our guidance of 29% to 31% growth
With a lower than expected revenue contribution from NACC, we expect recurring fee revenue growth to be closer to the lower end of that range
Excluding the impact of NACC, we expect recurring fee revenues to grow 6% to 7%, including organic growth of approximately 5%
We expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the middle of our 12% to 17% range or 13% to 15%
There are few factors at play in the fourth quarter to note
One, we expect ICS, excluding NACC, have a nice finish to the year on recurring fee and earnings growth
Two, NACC is expected to have a seasonally lighter contribution to the fourth quarter, and therefore, will be less meaningful to the quarter's earnings growth
And finally, we expect to incur higher expenses related to efficiency initiatives
Keeping our costs in check is critical to our overall growth strategy
And these initiatives will help to position us for additional growth by enabling us to reinvest in our business, while delivering bottom line growth in fiscal 2018 and 2019. Our final key metric is closed sales
As Rich noted earlier, we have reported record closed sales, and our pipeline remained strong
As a result, we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our closed sales guidance of $140 million to $180 million
One additional housekeeping item with regards to our guidance
We are raising our forecast for segment profit margins for GTO to approximately 21% from approximately 19.5%
That change reflects the healthy increase in GTO profits for the first nine months and our expectations for broadly similar margin in the fourth quarter
So, to sum up, Broadridge reported strong third quarter results, with double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EPS, and closed sales, and remain on track to deliver our fiscal year 2017 guidance on key metrics of recurring fee revenue growth, adjusted EPS, and closed sales
We continue to maintain a balanced approach to capital utilization, investing in our business while taking advantage of the increase with seasonal cash flow to step up repurchase activity
Broadridge remains focused on disciplined expense management
We expect spending on efficiency initiatives to increase in the fourth quarter, as we position the business for more growth
We look forward to closing out fiscal year 2017 and updating you on our plan for fiscal year 2018 on our August call
With that, I will now hand the call back to Rich for his closing remarks
And Connor (44:27), this is Jim
And it sounds like you did catch the comment on the lag between sales and revenue recognition
Again, it's a great success
We've built up a good set of deals in our revenue backlog
And because it's skewing towards larger deals that Rich mentioned, we'll take a little bit more time to see the revenue flow in
So, there'll be a little bit of delayed gratification
That said, it's giving us very good visibility into the next couple of fiscal years, which is a good spot to be in
Unknown Speaker Sure
Great
And Rich, you captured exactly why, which is as I can tell you since I've been here, this is a recurring activity at Broadridge
Sometimes, it's more formal, less formal
As Rich said, maybe a bit more intensity and formality around this
But this is kind of a muscle that we exercise pretty regularly
So, just sort of giving you a heads up that we could see a little bit of elevated expense in the fourth quarter for that, as part of laying our foundation for more growth
