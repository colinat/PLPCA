5,"For geographies and products, Asia continued as our fastest growing region, with revenue up 18% year-over-year"
6,"As Lip-Bu mentioned, digital and sign-off revenue was up 14% year-over-year, as we benefit from proliferation with market shaping customers and IP continued to rebound from 2016, with revenue up 15%"
7,"Functional verification revenue was down from last year, as overall hardware revenue was less than anticipated for the first half"
8,"However, we expect hardware revenue to be a little stronger for the second half"
9,Now let's turn to our outlook
10,We are increasing our revenue and EPS outlook
11,"For fiscal 2017, we now expect revenue in the range of $1.91 billion to $1.95 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1.04; non-GAAP EPS of $1.36 to $1.42; and operating cash flow in the range of $430 million to $470 million"

17,"In January of this year, the board authorized the repurchase of $525 million of our common stock"
18,"We did not repurchase shares in the first half of the year, but we do expect to repurchase some shares in Q3."
19,I also want to provide a few additional comments before we take questions
20,"As a reminder, hardware and IP have become a larger portion of our business, which may lead to more variability in our results from quarter-to-quarter"
21,Only about 5% of our revenue is in currencies other than the U.S
22,"dollar, primarily the Japanese yen"
23,But about 30% of our costs are in currencies other than the dollar
24,"So weakening dollar would generally be a headwind to operating profits, and conversely, a strengthening dollar would be a tailwind"
25,"The dollar further weakened in Q2, but so far, we have been able to manage through this challenge"
26,"As you know, we have been reviewing the new revenue recognition standard that we will implement for 2018, and we are confident that we will substantially maintain recurring revenue or revenue over time treatment"
27,"To conclude, we are pleased with our second quarter results, including strong financial performance, software and IP growth, and growing proliferation of our digital and sign-off solutions with market shaping customers"
28,"Looking forward, we are excited about the new opportunities resulting from our system-design enablement strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to drive strong financial and operating results"
29,"And with that operator, we will now take questions"
30,Question-and-Answer Session
31,"And Farhan, this is John Wall here"
32,"I'd just like to add that and remind you that, Q2 2016 was a record year for hardware, and that we continue to see a secular trend, and increasing customer need for emulation and acceleration products"
33,But just want to point out
34,"So Jay, this is John, I will take that first question on the cash flow"
35,"I'd just point you to the DSOs, that we had a six day decrease in DSO from Q1."
36,"A number of large payments came in after the end of the first quarter, driving a more favorable comparison between the quarters"
37,"So Q2 ended up being a very strong quarter for us, for collections"
38,"But so you will see a little bit more, a shift to the first half for cash collections"
39,"But our guidance reflects our confidence in the business, and takes into account everything we know at this time"
40,So we reiterated the cash flow guidance
41,"And Krish, this is John here"
42,"I just want to add that, we have great products in the hardware space"
43,"And note, that we delivered excellent financial results for Q2, software and IP were both strong, and we increased our outlook for the year"
44,So software and hardware in the first half is only part of what is a really good story
45,"Yeah Monika, this is John"
46,"I'd just like to add that, the R&D investment that we are making now is for future years"
47,"But our strategic priority is to develop innovative products and help our customers be successful, capture market segment share, and bring our solutions to market shaping customers"
