38,"We're making the investments we need to deliver shareholder value over the long term, and we are being very disciplined in driving continuous cost efficiencies"
39,Let me now reiterate our guidance for the third quarter
40,This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier
41,"As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which resulted in higher revenue of $265 million and higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million, netting into $115 million of non-GAAP operating income"
42,The guidance for the third quarter is as follows
43,We expect revenue in the range of minus 2% to 0% year-over-year
44,We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%
45,"The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%"
46,Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.59.
47,My guidance does not reflect any impact from AppDynamics
48,I will now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments
49,"No, I think just to add to that, I think we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the U.S"
50,"certainly, and in commercial and enterprise"
51,"And I'd say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, our guide, we always call it like we see it"
52,And it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line
53,"So I think – like Chuck said, I think the U.S"
54,"is solid, and again we're still cautious on outside the U.S"
55,and Europe and Asia
56,"No, yeah, I think what I say is between 1% and 2%, right"
57,So we're in that 1.5% to 2% range
58,"Well again, as we continue to accelerate the growth, as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing it, I referred it may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters it has been in that range"
59,"Yeah, we don't share gross margins by business unit, but I can tell you, the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions and the SaaS businesses we've been adding"
60,So it's very accretive to the Cisco average
61,"Hi, Vijay"
62,"Yeah, that's a great question, Steve"
63,"So actually product as a percentage of my total product revenue, it's up to 10% now this quarter for the first time,"
64,so we're happy about that
65,And we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business
66,Cisco ONE is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross enterprise ELAs that really are a core networking business to do that
67,So we're trying to find ways to find other offers
68,I'll just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned
69,"It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we're selling that"
70,We used to sell it always as a system
71,"Now we're selling the equipment, but we're selling it with a subscription"
72,So that's an example of how we've been able to kind of to drive new offers that had been traditionally just pure system or hardware
73,"And again, the teams are driving hard to find more ways to accelerate new offers that way"
74,Thank you
75,"Yeah, on the deferred, Mark, I mean that is part of why we're trying to make this shift to software"
76,It's our customers want those offers and to have easier way to run their IT departments
77,"But it clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure"
78,"And it's not only just the gross margin coming out of deferred revenue, but we're looking at our whole end-to-end operations, and how we go to market"
79,", how we drive operations in the back end here"
80,And there's real opportunities to drive both gross margins and operating margins
81,So that's why we're so focused on it
82,"That's why we're looking at acquisitions to add to it, and it will continue to help improve our mix on the margins line"
83,"I'll take that one, and a great question"
84,"Gross margins, we've been – again continue to operate well"
85,I'll say there were two specific kind of headwinds that we faced this quarter
86,"And to your point on APJC, I'll refer back to a year ago, we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities"
87,"Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smartcards to go with that, which they're basically for secure access and it was very, very high margin"
88,"So we had, if you go back a year ago, SP video in Asia was extremely strong because of that"
89,That program has dramatically slowed down
90,"And again, that pure margin just isn't there anymore, and you're seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP video and APJC"
91,The other item that's a headwind for us
92,"this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs, our DRAM memory costs that we're paying"
93,It's a very tight supply right now and we're seeing dramatic increases there
94,So that's hurting us quite a bit as well
95,"But other than that, I'd say the color's in the same line"
96,Our pricing is in – it's in the ranges that we've been the last six to eight quarters
97,"I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4."
98,"A little worse in (37:06) last quarter, but we were very low last quarter"
99,So in the normal ranges
100,But really it's those two specific things
101,"And I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP video, that China program, in Q3 as well"
102,I'll start on the supplier component issue
103,"So yeah, those articles are out there"
104,"We have had an issue from a supplier come out, and we did book a reserve for $125 million, you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release, to cover that"
105,"We always, and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this"
106,This is very proactive
107,"This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we're working with our customers to work through that"
108,So we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective
109,"Sure,"
110,so
111,yeah
112,So that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion and everything's growing in that space
113,"I'd say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that, because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly"
114,And they're all growing huge double digits
115,"But I will also say my switching, my routing, as well as data center and"
116,we've done Cisco ONE bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements
117,They've also been growing huge double digits as well
118,"So at the end of the day, the year-over-year increase is across the board"
119,Everything is up massively to drive to that 51%
120,"And again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security and wireless, they are two-thirds"
121,"I'd say of the balance, but the other pieces are rapidly -"
122,"Yeah,"
123,wireless being Meraki
124,", yes"
125,Hopefully that gives you the color you're looking for
126,Not as of right now
127,"Again, we're working very proactively with our customers and in terms of how quickly and where they want to do their replacement"
128,"So we're working very, very closely, but as of right now we have not seen and don't anticipate any massive revenue impact from this"
