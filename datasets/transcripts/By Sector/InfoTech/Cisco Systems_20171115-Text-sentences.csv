0,"Thank you, Marilyn, and, good afternoon, everyone"
1,Our results this quarter demonstrate the continued progress we're make on our strategic priorities
2,In Q1 we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61.
3,"We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue"
4,The progress we've made resulted in all three of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1.
5,"Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale"
6,"Today, the network is becoming more pervasive and critical to business success as billions of new connections are added"
7,"We expect these new connections will become increasingly automated, intelligent and secure, delivering unprecedented insights and intelligence to our customers"
8,"Cisco's vision is to deliver highly secure intuitive technology across our portfolio that is designed to constantly learn, adapt and protect to drive business outcomes with greater speed and agility"
9,"This extends to the network, next generation data center architectures, advanced IoT applications end-to-end analytics and our Collaboration technologies"
10,Our vision is resonating with customers and partners around the world as we help them build more secure intelligent platforms for their digital businesses
11,"Today, most of our customers are operating in complex, multi-cloud environments and Cisco is well positioned to provide them with networking capabilities, enterprise class security and support together with cloud scale, agility and economics"
12,Our new partnership with Google is a good example of this
13,"Over the last few months our engineering teams have been working closely together to jointly develop a new hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable applications and services to be deployed, managed and secured across on-premise environments, as well as Google Cloud Platform, bringing the best of cloud to the enterprise"
14,This partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web-scale providers
15,We're also investing to develop and acquire new technologies to extend our Multicloud Portfolio
16,"This includes ACI anywhere, which we announced this quarter and acquisitions such as CliQr, OpenDNS, Cloudlock, AppDynamics and Viptela"
17,Now I'd like to cover some key business highlights in our new product reporting categories
18,"First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms"
19,Our launch of The Network
20,Intuitive
21,in June is an example of the investment and innovation we're driving in our core business
22,"These new intent-based networking capabilities are providing customers' unparalleled insights and intelligence, together with highly-differentiated security and programmability"
23,"Our new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers in just over three months"
24,"We expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we're pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer"
25,"Additionally, we saw a good performance in our next-generation data center switching platforms as customers continue to shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures and embrace multi-cloud adoption"
26,We continue to advance our intent-based networking for data center and private cloud environments with the latest software release of ACI
27,"Over 4,000 ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility with network automation, simplified management and improved security"
28,"Going forward, we see a tremendous opportunity to benefit from a shift in customer demand from stand-alone products to integrated platforms with our intent-based infrastructure portfolio providing unmatched benefits"
29,Now turning to applications
30,Applications are absolutely central to every digital business strategy
31,"To maximize their effectiveness, companies require a highly-secure network that closely monitors applications and workload performance across a complex multi-cloud environment"
32,"Our acquisition of AppDynamics is core to our capability of providing end-to-end analytics, from the network to the data center to the application"
33,"Within our Applications business, we are enabling new capabilities based on advanced AI and machine learning across our portfolio"
34,"An example of this is our acquisition of Perspica, providing deep machine learning driven analytics to further extend AppDynamics' leading capabilities in application intelligence"
35,"Additionally, we announced our latest innovation on the Cisco Spark platform, Spark Assistant, which is the world's first enterprise-ready, AI-powered voice assistant to further enhance our customers' meeting experience"
36,Our intended acquisition of BroadSoft will enhance our subscription and cloud-based business
37,"BroadSoft has 19 million subscribers in the growing cloud voice and contact center space and will enable Cisco to offer an even broader portfolio of collaboration solutions to our customers, on-premise and in the cloud"
38,We expect this acquisition to accelerate the pace of innovation in our Collaboration business
39,and we see many opportunities to extend the reach of the BroadSoft portfolio
40,Moving to Security
41,"With an expanding threat landscape, cybersecurity is the number one priority for businesses worldwide and is at the heart of every company's digital strategy"
42,"In a multi-cloud world, as our customers' environments become increasingly distributed, security requirements only increase"
43,"At Cisco, security continues to be a strategic imperative and fundamental to everything we do"
44,"As customers adopt and advance intent-based networking, our end-to-end security is the foundation to keep our customers protected from advanced threats"
45,"This architecture, combined with the best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud, enables our customers to reduce the time to detection, as well as complexity and cost"
46,"As a result, we believe Cisco is delivering the most effective and comprehensive security solutions in the market"
47,"This differentiated strategy drove the 8% revenue growth in our Security portfolio, and we also saw continued momentum in our Security deferred revenue, with 42% growth"
48,"To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities"
49,I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead
50,"We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative portfolio of offerings in the industry, powered by intent-based capabilities and delivered through a range of consumption models providing more flexibility than ever before"
51,Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials
52,"Yes, Mark"
53,Thanks for the question
54,"So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio"
55,We're pleased with the early feedback
56,"I'll tell you that our sales teams, our partners and our customers are very excited about the architecture that we've announced"
57,It's still one quarter
58,So we have to get a little more time under our belt but
59,"what I will tell you is that when we look back at a transition like the 3850 years and years ago, it's very much in line"
60,"And I think that as more customers have the opportunity to test the automation and programmability and all of the software features that they're testing right now, we would hope that the platform continues to accelerate"
61,So one quarter down
62,but we feel good about where we are
63,"Well, thanks, Steve"
64,So what I said in the script is that a vast majority of our customers that are buying these platforms are opting for the advanced and I would say that it's a vast majority
65,We knew when we introduced a subscription on a switch that we needed to ensure that there was unique innovation that was available to our customers in order for them to see value in that
66,We couldn't just simply shift the capabilities that they had gotten before in a perpetual model
67,We needed to drive new innovation
68,"So the anchors that are in that advanced subscription are the overall automation capability, which really gets at the OpEx of running these networks"
69,And the second part is the encrypted traffic analytics where we can determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it
70,And we think that those two are phenomenal incremental capabilities that our customers didn't have before
71,and I think that's why we're seeing such a high attach rate
72,So we're very pleased with where we are on that as well
73,"So, Vijay, thanks for the question"
74,"We've been talking about this for several calls now, about how we reengaged with the large web scale providers back right after I became CEO"
75,And these are long processes as they made major architectural decisions
76,and they have franchises that you're trying to reenter
77,But if you look at â€“ whether it's the announcements we made with Microsoft
78,"a couple of quarters ago, the announcement we made with Google, you alluded to Alibaba, which there's a summary of that win on our website if you want to go"
79,see that
80,"It's our first insertion there, and actually it was before the large sales day that they experienced I think last week"
81,"And so we continue to make progress and we're continuing to execute on what I told you that we're executing on over the last year and a half, which is trying to go deeper"
82,I think the other thing that has become eminently clear is that these large web scale providers realize that it is going be a multi-cloud world and they definitely have come to the conclusion that the edge is going be mission critical for our customers going forward
83,"And as they think about that, we are very natural â€“ we're the very natural partner for them to partner with as the network is the only common denominator across all these cloud environments all the way out to the edge of our enterprise customer's network"
84,So we're just continuing to execute against what we set out two years ago and we hope to continue to see success
85,"And I think, Paul, from a perspective of the web scale, it's really just what I described"
86,We're in discussions with all of them
87,We have made announcements with several of them
88,And we continue to execute against our strategy
89,and it's â€“ â€“ these are large franchises
90,There's two facets
91,"And if you remember on a call back two or three calls back, I said that we're now expanding our discussions into 360-degree relationship discussions"
92,"The Google announcement was reflective of that comment, because not only are we working on their infrastructure"
93,"but we're also working significantly on this multi-cloud enablement, hybrid cloud enablement and helping bridge our customers, their premises-based solutions, their edge-based solutions, their cloud applications, their SaaS applications"
94,And so we're continuing to execute on that right now
95,"Kelly, do you want to"
96,"Yes, Ittai, so thanks for your comments by the way"
97,"On the hyperconverged offer, our HyperFlex offer, I would tell you that it has continued to probably be at the high end of my expectations"
98,I'd say couple of quarters
99,ago it began to exceed what I was expecting
100,so I changed my expectations
101,and it's â€“
102,but they're doing a great job
103,The teams are doing well
104,I think we know the use cases where it's very competitive
105,and I think that it continues to â€“ they continue to operate at the high end of what I expected from them
106,So we're very pleased with that
107,"On the question relative to SD-WAN, I think you nailed it right"
108,Our customers â€“ and we've talked about this for a couple of calls â€“ our customers have been trying to assess what this SD-WAN architectural transition looks like
109,"And I think that after we acquired Viptela, we have now â€“ at our sales meeting we provided tremendous clarity to our sales organization and our partner community at the Partner Summit about what our strategy is"
110,We've now taken customers through the road maps of what they can expect and how to position the different alternatives that we have and how those portfolios are going to come together over the next 12 to 18 months
111,So I think that it is a by-product of the SD-WAN discussion
112,And I would expect that we'll start to see customers move somewhat this quarter and
113,"then in the second half of the year, I think our customers will continue to begin to deploy some of these solutions"
114,"So, again, happy with where we are relative to the positioning of the different platforms"
115,Yes
116,"So, Tal, thanks for the question"
117,Let me break it down
118,"So the advanced subscription today is primarily being sold on the new Catalyst 9000, even though it's backwards compatible with a couple of years' worth of our â€“ I don't know, two, three years' worth of products that we've shipped in wireless and in routing, et cetera"
119,But what the customers are doing right now is they're basically becoming accustomed to the platform
120,"They're testing the platform before they make an investment on any sort of backwards compatibility, is what I would tell you"
121,I don't think we need to make any changes right now because the attach rate of the most advanced subscription offer is at the very high end of what I would have expected
122,So I think we're very pleased with where it is right now
123,"And assuming we execute on the value and the innovation that our customers continue to gain from that, then I think that we'll begin to see them then buy the subscriptions on some of their install base as well"
124,"Thanks, Mitch"
125,"So I think that the thing that is resonating with the customer is if you're looking at the environments that they're all beginning to operate in, they're operating in an environment where they have multiple SaaS providers, multiple cloud providers"
126,They've got their private data centers with applications running
127,They've got their branch networks
128,They've got now edge connectivity with IoT coming in
129,"And so, the robustness of an architecture that they have to have that protects across the network, across the endpoint, across the cloud is really what I think is differentiating it"
130,"And we've also â€“ we've been on a multiyear journey of selling software and subscriptions against the threat intelligence and the malware intelligence that we have, and I think that's what's continuing to pay off"
131,"So I think it's resonating with our customers and it's an architecture that we continue to innovate on, we continue to expand on"
132,"And, Kelly, any comments on the"
133,"Kelly, do you want to take"
134,"James, just to clarify one point or just add to actually, when Kelly says 12% of our product revenue is coming from recurring offers, just to put that in perspective, when I became CEO"
135,"it was 6%,"
136,so we've effectively doubled that
137,"And I think that's certainly helpful, and just we're seeing positive feedback on the launch"
138,"So, I'm sorry that was Simon"
139,In the enterprise switching?
140,"So, thanks for the question, Jeff"
141,"I think that if you look at some of the performance we saw around the world, to your point, in Europe and Asia we've talked about Huawei's activity over the last couple of quarters, I would say that our teams have been very focused on it"
142,I think that the intuitive network [The Network
143,] launch that we did in June really changes the discussion
144,"And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is up front cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a five-year period, it's probably 10X"
145,the cost of the upfront hardware
146,So going and helping our customers really reduce that is a value proposition that helps us change the discussion relative to the competition
147,So they continue to be very tough
148,but we think that competing on the price of the box upfront is something that we can shift over the next couple of years
149,"Yes, Erik, thanks for that"
150,"So at our Financial Analyst Conference this summer, we articulated a long range guide in line with what you just described"
151,We're going to have quarters that are going to vary from that
152,but that's definitely our long-term objective
153,And I think our teams are focused now on what is it
154,we need to do for the next wave of this architecture?
155,"Once we have this architecture built where we can actually defend and apply real-time defense against known threats, we can learn about a threat through malware and e-mail, and we can protect against it in the network, in the cloud, in the devices at the endpoint all at the same time"
156,So the teams are working hard to continue to drive innovation there but also looking at what other elements can we fit into this architecture over time
157,And I think that's how we think about the long-term guide
158,"And, Jim, just the market segment perspective that is probably pretty clear"
159,We saw service provider pretty much the same as it has been for some period of time
160,"Our largest enterprise customers, which the way we define it"
161,is really just is an organizational segment that we have
162,"We did see â€“ we saw negative mid single digits there, which you saw in the slides"
163,"In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis"
164,"and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see"
165,Our enterprise customers what I would tell you is that they're some of the biggest customers who take the longest amount of time to evaluate new platforms and new capabilities like The Network
166,as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion
167,So we're actively in those discussions with the enterprise customers
168,And our commercial customers tend to just move more quickly than others
169,"And then finally, on the public sector side, which we didn't talk about a lot, I think the big call out there"
170,I would say is that two quarters ago we talked about the pressure in the federal business
171,Last quarter we said we saw it improving and
172,what I would tell you is that in this quarter we saw the year-end
173,it seemed fairly normal
174,While they still have a lot of leadership roles that haven't been filled and we still have the impending December debt ceiling issue overall for this quarter
175,we saw the federal business pretty much back to what we expected as we closed the quarter
176,So that's probably the commentary I could provide on the market segments
177,"Well, that's it, isn't it?"
178,I'll wrap it
179,"Thanks, everyone again for joining us today"
180,I just want to wrap with a few points
181,"First off, we are committed to executing on this vision to deliver a highly secure intelligent platform for our customers' digital business"
182,And we are laser focused on five key elements of that strategy to enable our customers' success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well
183,"First, we are fundamentally reinventing networking with our intent-based networking platform"
184,"We intend to further accelerate our leadership here extending intuitive technologies across the broad portfolio that we have while increasing application, visibility and automation"
185,"Secondly, security is fundamental to everything we do"
186,"You can't build a next generation digital business without a comprehensive security strategy across endpoints, network and the cloud"
187,"Third, it is very clear that it's a multi-cloud world, and Cisco is in a unique position to help our customers navigate this by expanding our multi-cloud portfolio and extending our web scale partnerships with strategic cloud providers"
188,Our Google partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers
189,"Fourth, we're unlocking the power of the data with advanced analytics such as our solutions AppDynamics, encrypted traffic analytics and Talos threat intelligence"
190,We're also embedding AI and machine learning technologies across the breadth of our portfolio
191,"And lastly, we will continue to deliver a more enhanced customer and employee experience through our broad Collaboration portfolio including our intent to acquire BroadSoft"
192,"Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you"
