82,"We would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter"
83,"And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A"
84,Question-and-Answer Session
85,So two things I'd highlight there related to guide
86,"I'd be reluctant to quantify, but EMEA combined with the shortfall that we saw on services, which – we had talked last quarter about services continuing to decline, but then through the year we'd see it shallow out and then start to grow again"
87,"It ended up dropping a little more than we anticipated, and that was us just misreading the tea leaves on some end-of-life products, so to get that out there"
88,"Coming back to EMEA, the combination of those two, yeah, they would've had impact on the number we think"
89,"So that's why we're highlighting it, and it has our focus"
90,"And then, in terms of what we're seeing there, John, did you want to?"
91,Yeah
92,"I'm not sure conservatism is the word I'd use on this, because I think we've been talking with the sales organization, evaluating the pipeline, looking at the business"
93,We've highlighted this for a number of quarters now
94,This really isn't a new dynamic for us
95,"And I think taking it all in collectively, we looked at the picture that we thought we could expect from the business at this time and factored that into the guidance"
96,And that's resulted in the guidance we gave you today
97,"And you might have to help me if I miss one of your questions, but I think you started with linearity"
98,"And actually, early in the quarter, we felt pretty good about our start in January"
99,"As we got through the first month, we felt pretty good about it and then started to see it taper off"
100,"It was similar to the prior quarter, in that middle month kind of pull back and then landed"
101,"okay, I would put it"
102,"And then, to your question on our product refresh"
103,"One thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh, and I think at times we don't draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments, because we talk about – in the first full quarter, we want to see roughly 25%"
104,and we see that increasing over four quarters to 80%
105,"And so, when does that really kick in for us is a driver?"
106,"And if we look back historically, really it's when we start to get into the higher percentages of the sales being represented by those new appliances that we really see the full driver"
107,So we did feel we saw some good wins this quarter
108,and it did impact the product revenue growth that we saw
109,But we think we're going to see that get through Q3 and start to build after that
110,"So on the average deal size; I think last quarter we were at right around $110,000."
111,"This quarter it moved up a little bit, $125,000."
112,So one of the things that is giving us confidence is seeing the average deal size move up a little bit
113,But our $1 million plus size deals were actually pretty strong across the rest of the world
114,"And when we evaluate our business, that's an important metric for that"
115,"And then, for cloud"
116,"Specifically, my in-line was the uptick of the appliances in sales"
117,So not necessarily the – I don't know that I can verify your 20%
118,"I mean it definitely did, when it got to full steam, drive very solid revenue growth"
119,"And so, when we look at it internally, we look at the uptick and start to watch when it gets – we're in the second quarter, it's in line in terms of percent with what we've seen previously"
120,"Your comment's very fair, it was more elongated before"
121,So we're trying to factor that in and then looking at how it's going to drive product
122,"And as I said, we have our guidance and we think we'll see that really start to kick in as we exit Q3."
123,"Well, you have our guidance for June, right?"
124,So I'm going to let that stand as it is
125,"Then, I think as we go into Q4, which is our calendar Q4, has its own dynamics"
126,And I think we'll see it play in there
127,"And then really as we expand out 18 months to 24 months and if you look historically, that's when we've seen it be a real strong driver"
128,Yeah
129,"We always talk about that as software becomes more prominent in our business, that naturally is going to carry up to gross margin"
130,"Historically, we've looked look at that as an opportunity to derive top line growth"
131,Probably the most prominent example recently is investments in Silverline
132,And I think we'll continue to do that and balance that trade-off of investment against higher gross margin
133,I think we're right on track
134,Yeah
135,"I think specifically what we say, and this on the October call, is we gave general guidelines of guidance"
136,"And we have said pretty consistently over the last three or four years that we expect op margin with seasonality to pull back in Q1 and Q2, because it's important for us to not slow the machine down on our investing and head count to try to overly – I'll use the term overly manage op margin"
137,"And then, on strength of revenue see that increase in the back half"
138,So I believe that plays out on revenue strength again
139,"And you have our guidance, as I said, for Q3."
140,"And then, we'll give guidance for Q4 and see where that takes us"
141,And this is Andy
142,Just one thing to add that we're not seeing –
143,and I think it's important to highlight and was within John's comments
144,"was,"
145,the competitive landscape there for us hasn't changed
146,"And obviously with the comments we're putting out here just around the theater, I mean we spend a lot of time talking with sales management making sure we understand what's going on"
147,"And the one area that we came away feeling good about is, competitively we feel as strong as ever"
148,"And that's why John was highlighting that we saw deals pushing, not deals losing"
149,And we think that's important to highlight
150,"So we are readdressing everything from the structure, and how we're aligning resources and the view of the market coming through in our guidance, but I think that's worth highlighting on a positive note"
151,Yeah
152,"So I'll take the first part of that question, which is our view on growth and product"
153,"And, yes, if you back into our guidance with what we give you, that might look like it's pulling back a little bit"
154,"But, broadly, we think we're going to be pushing hard on the top line"
155,and we think we have every opportunity with the drivers we have in place
156,We're talking about the Shuttle series and a lot of the other products
157,Our viewpoint is not that
158,"I wouldn't comment on next year, up or down, but we believe we're a growth company"
159,"At our scale, what does that mean?"
160,We'll see
161,"We provide guidance quarterly, but that's our number one priority to push the top line, and we're going to focus on execution and work to make that happen"
162,Yeah
163,"I think, generally, we look at the broader trends that we're seeing across software security"
164,"François highlighted that our security had strong growth year-over-year, continue to expect that from software"
165,"We're not going to guide it specifically, but the trends are there"
166,and we like what we're seeing
167,"And as it relates to gross margin, we talked about it a little bit earlier"
168,"Yeah, it could push up gross margin"
169,We're not guiding that
170,"We talk a lot about reinvesting that back in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate that on a quarterly basis as we see the opportunity present itself to us"
171,"But, broadly, the trends are there going in the right direction, and we like where we sit"
172,Yeah
173,"And actually the way to look at this is, we're modeling it is, sequentially it was basically flat, up $0.5 million"
174,We think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again
175,"And really the driver to that is, we did end of life a number of older boxes"
176,I think they averaged over 7 years old
177,"and they did have strong attach rates to them,"
178,still renewal rates
179,"The impact of it, frankly, I just – I missed the modeling on it and the impact was bigger than I anticipated"
180,So that's where we ended up
181,Yeah
182,"I don't think we're going to see anything in the short-term, and we'd advise you of that"
183,I would highlight surrounding this discussion that our deferred revenue was pretty strong in the quarter
184,"So we saw that go up 10%, and the majority of that is annual maintenance"
185,So I would look at that too to balance the expectations
186,"But as I said, when we started, we now think, off of this new base, it's a bit of reset, but we're going to start sequentially growing again at least in rough dollar basis consistent with what you've seen in the past"
187,No
188,We didn't break that out
