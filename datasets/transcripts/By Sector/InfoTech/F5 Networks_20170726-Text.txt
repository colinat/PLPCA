Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone
While we delivered year-over-year growth of 4% and strong profitability in the third quarter, our product revenue performance fell short of our expectations
The reacceleration of product revenue growth remains our number one priority, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on this over the coming periods
Customer adoption of our recently introduced products remains strong and our revenue is increasingly coming from more diverse sources, including Virtual Editions, public cloud solutions, and application security
On the overall demand environment for our core ADC solutions, the cloud continues to cause some degree of pause while certain customers evaluate their application architectures and deployment options
Our conversations indicate many organizations are still trying to assess the true benefits of the cloud balanced against the true cost
Additionally, some customers remain undecided about how to work with large cloud service providers and avoid lock-in with one vendor, which we believe is increasing the exploration of hybrid and multi-cloud deployment
Over the long term, we believe the complexities and security risk of multiple deployment environments play to our strength
They require the types of advanced application services we excel at providing
As customer needs evolve, we are accelerating our efforts to meet their requirement for our solutions across various deployment environments and consumption models
While we have already made significant progress on these fronts, we recognize the need to move even faster to ensure we provide our secure application services in the way customers demand now and in the future
Taking a closer look at third quarter results, the EMEA theater again underperformed relative to our expectations
Conditions in the UK did not improve during Q3, and we saw headwinds in this market from a further slowdown in government activity
In addition, we are seeing several European-wide regulatory initiatives around data protection and usage creates short-term disruption in spending
We have taken a number of steps to ensure our resources are properly aligned to growth opportunities across territories and customer verticals
Our security solutions delivered solid growth in the third quarter
We saw strength in our firewall offerings into the service provider vertical where we believe we continued to gain market share
We saw additional purchases from a large U.S
service provider who is deploying VIPRION Gi firewalls across their mobile switching centers, as they provide significant scalability and performance over the customer's legacy vendor
In North Africa, a major telecom provider building out its LTE network is utilizing a VIPRION deployment to support multiple features, including Gi firewall, DDoS and application security
Within the enterprise vertical, attach rates for security modules remain high, and we had a number of wins around our web application firewall offering
This includes a large North American IT services management company that is implementing our WAF solution across iSeries appliances to protect against layer 7 attacks and provide compliance with security audits and PCI
As mitigating application level threats and ensuring policy consistency takes on increasing priority for our customers, security has become a key driver for F5. As it relates to supporting customers that have begun to make architectural decisions around moving workloads to the cloud, we are encouraged by the early signs
It is clear from our conversations with customers that they value the programmability and flexibility that TMOS and iRules provide
During Q3, we completed a deal with a large U.S
federal agency as a part of their process to lift and shift some of their applications to the public cloud
This involved the purchase of a significant number of VE licenses as the customer transitions some of their applications from our hardware ADC platform to our virtual offerings, both on-prem and in the public cloud
During the third quarter, we introduced several exciting new solutions aimed at helping our customers manage their applications in a multi-cloud world
These solutions give customers the freedom to deploy any application anywhere with consistent application services and enterprise-grade security
Key new releases included BIG-IP Virtual Edition for the Google Cloud Platform
This release means that organizations can now deploy F5 services in all major public clouds with Bring-Your-Own-License offers for instances ranging from 25 megabits per second to 5 gigabits per second
Container Connector supports the easy deployment of application services in containerized environments and simple integration of capabilities into management and orchestration systems
Application Connector inserts application services from the edge of the public cloud and securely connects any public cloud provider to the customer's interconnection or data center
In the case of AWS, Application Connector can automatically discover workloads for application services insertion
I want to take a moment to share some of my impressions from my first four months at the company and my thoughts on the significant long-term opportunity I see for F5. Since joining in early April, I have spent considerable time meeting with customers across verticals and theaters
Throughout these conversations, customers told me F5 is a key partner as they evolve their application architecture to support emerging hybrid and public cloud environments
They value F5's ability to enable consistent application services across environments, ensure applications are fully secured and compliant and protect them against cloud lock-in
One of the changes we are seeing is the demand to consumer technology in multiple deployment models, including private cloud, public cloud, software-only and various subscription and pay-as-you-go models
I believe these new environments and consumption models for application services will create a meaningful opportunity for growth in our market
As a company, we have already begun to refocus our energies around supporting the varied application deployment environments and consumption models our customers are demanding
This focus is evident in our recent product introductions that help customers better navigate a multi-cloud world
It is also evident in the new subscription pricing for Virtual Editions we introduced at the beginning of July
By putting more structure around our subscription offering, we can better engage customers across a spectrum of potential consumption models
Improving the ease of consuming our solutions is expected to open new customer opportunities and we are encouraged by the initial response
We are at the early stages of an evolution from a largely appliance-based ADC company selling perpetual licenses to a diverse secure application services company with a breadth of hardware, software and subscription-based services
While this evolution will not happen overnight, ensuring we are taking the necessary steps to remain the clear leader in delivering application services is where I am devoting my time and where we as a company will be devoting our development and go-to-market resources
Before concluding, I want to recognize the contributions of Julian Eames, F5's Chief Operations Officer and Executive Vice President, who will be retiring after the end of our fiscal year
Julian joined F5 in 2000 when the company boasted just over 500 employees and became part of the executive team in 2001. Julian has been a driving force behind developing a world-class services organization that now stands at over 1,200 people and generated over $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016. Julian will remain actively involved in his day-to-day operations until his retirement, and we have begun the process of finding his successor
I know I can speak for the entire F5 team in expressing my gratitude for Julian's contributions and wishing him the very best in his retirement
Finally, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter
With that, we'll now hand the call over for the Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
Thank you, Jess
Look, I'll take the first one on product growth
So where we are in the iSeries refresh cycle, we're about three quarters into the cycle
And typically, in the past, we've seen an acceleration in product growth once we are further into the cycle and iSeries represent a higher percentage of our sales
We are tracking â€“ as you look at the percentage of our appliance sales that are represented by iSeries, we're actually tracking to prior growth cycles or prior product cycles
And that's part of what gives us the confidence that we can have product revenue growth in coming quarters
I think the shift to virtual isn't necessarily what we think is holding us back
As it relates to this quarter in particular, we didn't have the performance that we expected out of a couple of geographies; EMEA and Japan, but EMEA more specifically
And that's fairly specific to some macro environment challenges in the EMEA, some to do with the regulatory environment, specifically in the UK and more pronounced in the finance vertical
So that's what really, for us this quarter, led us to not be in the range that we expected in revenues
But, generally, our appliance sales are tracking as we expected it to be
We continue to see growth in our Virtual Edition offerings, both because of private cloud and now increasingly because of public cloud
And as we get further into the cycle, our expectation is to continue to see product revenue growth
Thank you, Brian
So, a couple of areas
So, first of all, let me comment on the pause and then I'll come back to your comment on marginalization
No, we are definitely seeing that some deals are getting pushed out as some of our customers think through their architectures
And we have customers across the spectrum, so we have a number of customers who 9 or 12 months ago would have said, hey, we're moving everything to the cloud, and it created a significant pause in the their spend
And they've now made that decision, they've moved to the cloud and come back and their spend is actually healthier with us than it was prior to them going through the cycle
We have a number of customers and we're seeing more of them that are now going through the cycle and, as a result of that, are pushing decisions because they're revisiting their architecture decisions
In a number of cases, these are not deals that we're losing
We have visibility into these deals, we're not losing them, but they're being pushed out
And that's why we're using this term that we're seeing a pause
As it relates to marginalization, to your point around do we feel F5 is being marginalized, I don't think so
And I think you have to parse the market a little bit
For the customers that we have typically served and, typically, those customers have large and complex workloads, when they're moving to either private cloud environment or a combination of private cloud and public cloud, we are involved in the conversation, and we feel we have a very strong win rate and we have relevant offerings to support them
So I don't feel that there's any marginalization going on with our existing customer base
There are, however, a number of applications that are being basically bought in the cloud, but created directly in the cloud that are perhaps typically less complex workloads than we have served
These are, for us, significantly new opportunities, as the world goes more digital, more and more applications
And I would say, yes, in that environment, we are not yet participating to the degree that, eventually, I would like us to participate, but that's essentially an opportunity for us to extend our addressable market that we are going to look at how we can execute against that
Brian, we're not guiding for next year
But I would say we're pretty confident we will see product revenue growth in 2018.
Thank you, Jim
So, I think there are two effects in Europe from what we're seeing
One is a bit of the uncertainty that the regulatory environment is creating
There are things like regulation around data protection and all the regulatory, specifically, in the finance vertical, that is causing folks to think about location of data centers, what their hybrid cloud environments are going to look like, et cetera
That's the macro environment and we don't control that or how a real prediction into that other than we know that a lot of this regulation should be settled in the early parts of 2018. There are also some things that we believe have more to do with the execution of F5, so the more internal
And on those aspects, yes, we are taking actions
We believe that, in some cases, we have probably too many people in some geographies where there's not enough opportunity and not enough people and geographies where we see growth opportunity
So we are realigning our resources against the best geographies and verticals
I think as I said on the last call, because it's Europe, this typically takes a significant amount of time
It's not â€“ it doesn't happen overnight
And we're also making sure that we're enabling our teams in Europe, both enabling and training our teams in Europe for the new opportunities that we're seeing around hybrid cloud environments, for an example
So, there are some things we're doing internally that we believe will help and contribute
And then the macro environment, we think, for the next six to nine months, we don't expect a significant improvement in the macro
We have a pretty strong process that goes bottoms-up against pretty much every geography and vertical, and we continue to be thorough about it
We're being a bit more cautious about EMEA this quarter
We're not expecting, as I said, any improvement in the region, and so we've factored that into our guidance
But the process has been quite thorough as it had been from prior quarters
The other area that I would flag is in the federal space, there's a bit of timing uncertainty linked to the delay in the budget approval here in the U.S
And we have factored that uncertainty in the federal space as well in our guidance
Thank you, Jim
I'll start on the â€“ Paul, on your first question
Andy will take the second one
On the non-U.S
federal, I think in the UK, we also saw this quarter some delays
Well, I mentioned the delays in certain deals earlier
In the UK, we had some government deals that were delayed a little bit
Our non-U.S
federal number isn't very large, so there'll be an element of ebbs and flows quarter-on-quarter
But, specifically, this quarter, I think that was a factor
Rod, yeah, just a correction, what I said was that we were three quarters into the cycle not three quarters of the way through
And it's typically eight quarters â€“ six to eight quarter cycle
So we haven't reached the midpoint of the cycle yet
We've just actually crossed the point where iSeries this quarter represented more than 50% of our appliance sales
In the past, we've typically seen that acceleration when we're closer to the 80% mark of our total appliance sales
So, to be clear, we think it's an eight-quarter cycle and we're about three quarters into it
I think if you look at how this cycle is tracking and we track that fairly closely in terms of what percentage of our total sales are with the new platform
It's tracking very, very closely to what we saw in the prior cycle
So it looks to be taking the same shape
There are some differences in the â€“ obviously, in the environment
Last time we did a refresh, ACE replacement actually happened â€“ the Cisco ACE replacement happened in the similar timeframe and so that gave us an additional boost
That's much less the case here
And also, as we've said before, we're saying that some of the deals getting pushed out as a result of the evaluation of cloud architecture
So, there are some things in the environment that are different to what we had a few years back
But in terms of how the cycle is tracking relative to what we've done in the past is very similar
And the other thing, Troy, is you're looking at an aggregate number
You heard me talk about Europe, and I said we're realigning resources against opportunities
When we talk about the evolution of our offering towards subscription, virtual environment, et cetera, again, that requires some alignment of resources towards these opportunities
So don't mistake the total number in quarter for a lack of activity around hiring folks on what we believe are some very exciting growth opportunities for the company
Thank you, Troy
Thank you, Meta
On the first question, yes, actually, we are seeing a higher demand for best bundle than we would have in prior cycles, and that's largely because securities is important and increasingly important
One of the things that the cloud does is it dissolve the perimeter, and our solutions for security are application centric; they're not perimeter-based solution
And that's actually one of the reasons we're doing well with security and seeing more and more opportunities
So, the best bundle is actually the â€“ we're seeing higher demand for that, which you can translate into we're seeing a higher security attach rates to our solution, which we actually think is a very good growth driver
As it relates to partnership and acquisitions, look, our philosophy about this has been and frankly is going to be, we want to have very strong organic plans for addressing the high-growth opportunities in our market, which essentially revolve around the cloud and security
And part of the resource shift that we talk about really relates to how we accelerate our execution organically against these opportunities
That being said, if we believe there's opportunities to accelerate that inorganically that makes sense for us, whether it's partnership or acquisitions, we will do that
We have a number of partnerships in place already in the ecosystem both with cloud providers and a number of IT â€“ other IT players that help us, but we won't roll out doing some things in the marketplace if and when we see an opportunity
No, it makes sense
I understand the question
So, the reason we're saying it's tracking after prior cycle is really a key metric for iSeries is the adoption of the product in the customer base as in do our customers see good reasons to adopt this new platform and refresh their environment? And the best way for us to measure that is to look at the percentage of our total appliance sales that come from this new platform
And when you look at that percentage quarter-on-quarter, we're tracking pretty much exactly with prior quarters
Now, to your second question, which was
Thank you, Andy
That's largely because, in the past, that has been the point at which customers have made the initial deployments of this new platform, they've done the necessary software upgrades and test and proof-of-concept, they're a bit unfamiliar with the platform and they get into the mode of more repeat purchases and that's where we typically see an acceleration
That's what we have seen in the past and that's why we've looked at that 80% marker as a good indicator of the point in the cycle where we see this
As I said, again, the environment is different now than it was in the past, but if you look at these metrics we're tracking
The only thing, Jeff, that I would add is, whilst we look at the refresh cycle as a growth opportunity for F5, I think we also want to be clear that that is not solely what we see as the medium to long term growth driver for the company
And I want to be very, very clear with that, that we see the number of applications being deployed in private and public cloud and specifically in virtual ADC market, we see that as a growth market
And a big priority for us is to make our solutions easy to consume, remove any friction there is in consuming our solutions in different environments because we believe that is going to open additional opportunities for us, specifically, in the virtual ADC space
And that I see as a growth driver for the company
The other important growth driver is application-centric security
It is a bigger issue
We're seeing more and more attach rates to our solutions
We're seeing more security stand-alone opportunities
We have best-in-class web application firewall capabilities
We're seeing strong demand for that
And we think, with the cloud, there's going to be even more of a need for application-centric security
So, beyond the refresh, I see these two as important drivers for the medium to long term for us
So GDPR is one of the elements that we've seen as uncertainty â€“ yes, creating some uncertainty in Europe
No
Attrition are in line with historical levels
In fact, attrition is much better than it was even a couple of years ago
So, no, we're not seeing that
Yes
So, I'll take the security question and Ryan Kearny will talk about what we're doing about containers
So, yeah, the position that we have that's actually quite unique in the security space is, as I said, number one, that we â€“ unlike a number of other players, we're not a perimeter security company
We're more of an application security player
And one of the benefits that that gives us is we have the ability to see data in the line of the application of between the user and the application
And because of the capabilities in BIG-IP in terms of scale and throughput, we also have an ability to analyze the in-line data in real-time
So that gives us the opportunity to do some interesting things with the data, which we think is important and probably will play into our future
Ryan, on the containers?
Thank you, Alex
Good reflections
Listen, one of the â€“ I think where you are correct is, one of the key, I'd say, intangible assets of F5 is our understanding of applications and the concentration of application networking talent that exists at F5 is â€“ I think is unparalleled in the industry
And you've heard me say before that I believe we have an opportunity to expand the breadth of application services that we offer
And security is actually one of these domains
Our philosophy around this is that we have to have strong organic plans to do that and there's a number of things we're doing organically that we've started executing on that we'll be able to discuss at a later stage, not today
But we're doing a number of things organically to expand our addressable market beyond perhaps the traditional solutions that we offer today
If and when we see some good opportunities to extend that inorganically, as I said, we will not rule that out
But it's got to start with some organic execution
And we have a priority, as I said, to grow the top line
We said that's our number one priority
We do see product revenue growth next year and we've got a number of exciting organic propositions that we're executing on that we believe will contribute to that
Thank you, Alex
