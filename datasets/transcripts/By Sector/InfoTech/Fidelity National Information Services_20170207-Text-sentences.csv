10,"For full-year 2016, IFS revenue increased 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA increased 4.2% compared to the prior-year period"
11,"Adjusting for the absence of incentive accruals discussed in the prior quarter, EBITDA would've increased 5.7% for the year, reflecting margin expansion of 20 basis points on an apples-to-apples basis"
12,Turning to slide 11.
13,Banking and Wealth was relatively flat for the quarter

30,"EBITDA grew 17.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting 380 basis points of margin expansion to 30.4%"
31,This was driven by higher margin product sales and cost synergies
32,2016 margin results exceeded our expectations and marked an important milestone for the SunGard transaction
33,"As we outlined in previous calls, we expected to exceed 30% margins over time in this segment"
34,"We're very pleased to complete 2016 at just over 30%, which was faster than anticipated"
35,"As discussed earlier this year, the GFS segment has shown significant structural improvement as a result of the SunGard acquisition, which improved the revenue quality, increasing the amount of revenue tied to recurring IP-led solutions"
36,This improved revenue mix and the execution of our integration plan contributed to significant margin expansion in the segment

47,Moving to slide 14.
48,"Corporate and Other revenue for the fourth quarter was $159 million, with an EBITDA loss of $44 million"

52,Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow
53,Free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the year
54,"In the fourth quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings was 115%"
55,"We reduced our debt by approximately $1 billion in 2016, and had approximately $10.5 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31."

60,"As we recently announced, the transaction closed on February 1, 2017."
61,"Based on the timing of the close, this transaction created a $0.13 adjusted EPS headwind for 2017, net of interest expense savings"
62,"For the purposes of modeling, full-year 2016 EBITDA for PS&E, was approximately $80 million"
63,"The transaction produced approximately $500 million of net cash proceeds, which was used to pay down debt"
64,"We also announced we will redeem our $700 million, 5% interest senior notes due 2022."
65,The redemption of these notes accelerates our deleveraging efforts and reduces our interest expense
66,"We anticipate using free cash flow in 2017 to eliminate all our remaining prepayable debt, reducing our outstanding debt below $9 billion by the end of the year"
67,"Finally, due to our 2016 performance, we recently announced a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share"
68,"Looking forward to 2017, due to the strategic nature and scale of the IFS and GFS segments, I would like to provide some additional color on segment drivers, which guided our planning process for the year"
69,We are also providing guidance on IFS and GFS revenue growth in 2017.
70,IFS will continue to serve our U.S
71,"market, consolidating at the higher end of its historical trends"
72,We also continue to see aggressive competition across all our solutions
73,These factors are driving us to the lower end of IFS long-term organic revenue guidance
74,"GFS will continue to see strong growth in institutional and wholesale, and an improvement in our Banking and Payment Solutions"
75,We expect single-digit growth for our consulting services for the full year
76,"Specific to the first quarter of 2017, both IFS and GFS faced difficult comparisons, primarily driven by a previously discussed people-based project, and the anniversary of accelerated EMV card production in IFS, and a large license renewal in GFS"
77,"For the full year, Corporate and Other segment, which houses our non-strategic assets, we created approximately 1% top line headwind to consolidated organic revenue growth"
78,"This decline is primarily driven by a loss of the client, who was acquired in late 2016, continuing decline in check volumes at the point of sale, and loss attributed to the planned divestiture of the public and sector (sic)"
79,[sector and]
80,(19:31) education revenue growth
81,"To be clear, organic growth is adjusted for the divestiture of PS&E, but the loss of higher growth from this business will be a headwind during the year"
82,"Finally, in addition to our debt payments and dividends, we expect to generate excess cash in 2017."
83,"This will create flexibility for other cash uses beginning in late 2017 and into 2018, including, but not limited to, share buybacks"
84,Turning to slide 17.
85,"For 2017, we expect consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, IFS organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%"
86,"Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.04 billion to $3.12 billion, implying reported growth of 3% to 6%, or 6% to 9% adjusting for the impact of the PS&E divestiture"
87,"Adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.30 per share representing growth of 9% to 13%, or 12% to 16% adjusted for the impact of the PS&E divestiture and does not include any share buybacks"
88,"Finally, exiting the year with a cost synergy run rate in excess of $275 million, an increase from our previous target of $250 million"
89,"Similar to last year, we have also provided additional assumptions to better assist your modeling efforts for the year"
90,These are found in the appendix of today's presentation
91,"Of note, I would like to call out our effective tax rate assumption for the year, which is 32%"
92,"This 300 basis point reduction from the prior year period is driven by efficient tax planning strategies, growth in lower tax geographies, and the impact from changes in accounting treatment of stock-based compensation"
93,Current consensus estimates do not fully reflect the impact of the public sector and education divestiture
94,"Further, to help with modeling, the quarterly spread of our expectations for 2017, we expect first quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83."
95,"For fourth quarter of 2017, our expectations are up to $0.05 per share above current consensus estimates"
96,"This reflects the full-year impact of the divestiture of PS&E, the previously discussed grower risk (21:54) in IFS and GFS in the first quarter, as well as higher seasonality in the fourth quarter and timing of synergies"
97,"Similar to last year, we have a conservative view on the overall macro conditions and have not assumed any improvements in conditions in the markets we serve"
98,We are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continue to drive value to our shareholders through compelling business model and strong cash flow generation
99,That concludes our prepared remarks
100,"Operator, you now may open the line for questions"
101,Question-and-Answer Session
102,"Good morning, Dave"
103,"Yes, that sits in the Corporate and Other segment"
104,"It was a commercial services customer, David"
105,The impact to consolidated organic growth is about a point with a combination of that loss and declining check volumes in that segment
106,The IFS and GFS segments were not affected by this
107,"Again, their growth being in line with what we talked about back in May"
108,And there was a relatively small term fee associated with the transaction
109,"Thanks, David"
110,"That's correct, Dave"
111,It overall is a drag on total company organic growth in that zone
112,"Yeah, a couple of things"
113,"One, I tried to highlight the components of what's driving it"
114,"Of the 300 basis point reduction, about 1 point or 100 basis points is really driven by the accounting change in stock comp, where everybody should get some level of benefit there"
115,200 points is really driven off of tax planning strategies and lower rate geographies
116,"It can continue to go down in the current environment, as we continue to work through tax planning strategies, and as our international revenue base continues to grow"
117,You've got three moving parts around reported to organic
118,You've got the $9.2 billion base you're talking about
119,"If you remember, we had a deferred revenue acquisition adjustment around SunGard of about $200 million"
120,"We've got expectations of around $75 million of currency impact being a negative, and then the PS&E sale being about 3 points and that would drive you from reported of 1% to 2% to organic of 2% to 3%"
121,"As we talked about in May, we really gave 3% to 7% organic revenue guide over the horizon, with 13% to 18% earnings per share growth"
122,I would not anticipate changing that guide
123,We do have an adjustment associated with PS&E
124,But the individual earnings per share growth per year we think is very close to that
125,"If you adjust out PS&E this year, you're in 12% to 16% underlying growth in the business"
126,"Yeah, if you remember specifically, we tried to give you an implied number associate, but we're trying to give percentage growth over that horizon"
127,"It will be difficult to get to that full $4.70 number, Ashwin, with the sale of PS&E, but we do anticipate in that 13% to 18% EPS growth"
128,It will be difficult to get to a $4.70 number with the sale of PS&E
129,"The growth, we believe, will be in the 13% to 18% range for 2018."
130,"Yeah, the $850 million was a gross number on the proceeds"
131,We ended up with a net number of around $500 million
132,What that read-through is that you had very little tax basis
133,in the PS&E assets through SunGard and our tax-free acquisition of SunGard
134,"So, you ended up having a tax bill associate with that"
135,"Beyond that, we're prepaying all our prepayable debt in 2017, combination of PS&E proceeds, as well as free cash flow, and then anticipate continuing to have additional cash to be able to use for other purposes later in 2017."
136,"If you go into the tax rate, Brett, if you go back to May, we looked at the bridge of earnings growth over the next couple of years"
137,The tax rate was a component of that
138,We're just getting it a little faster than we anticipate
139,"And to your comment with regard to revenue growth, we wanted to make sure we put together another conservative guide that we felt very comfortable being able to meet or exceed"
140,We don't have a specific one
141,"We talked about in May, if you look back to the guide, we talked about in May, what would drive to the lower end of the 3% to 6% and what would drive you to the higher end of the 3% to 6%"
142,Continued higher levels of consolidation would drive you towards the lower end and that's where we're at
143,We're still at a high level of consolidation and there's very little to no de novo activity in the marketplace
144,I think the broader commentary is really going to be around continued consolidation
145,You've seen IFS running in the lower end of that for a few years
146,We've got some tailwinds specifically this year in EMV and the people-based project
147,"But we think that that lower end, that 3% to 4% zone, is where you're at really given consolidation being the broader driver there"
148,You had a people-based services project in IFS that was completed in the third quarter that won't recur in the first quarter
149,"You've got accelerated EMV growth in first quarter of 2016 that will be a difficult grow over in 2017, and we had a large license renewal in the I&W, the Institutional and Wholesale Group, and global trading that will not recur in the first quarter"
150,Those are the three biggies that are headwinds for Q1.
151,I'm glad you asked the question because I think I actually misspoke to on Ashwin's question
152,I want to make sure we've got it clear
153,This year we've got a $4.15 to $4.30 range I just outlined
154,"We believe we can grow that 13% to 18% in 2018, which I still think that collective will imply $4.65, $4.68 to almost $5.00."
155,That guidance has stayed intact
156,What I was trying to isolate was PS&E around the original guide would be difficult
157,"But our range of $4.15 to $4.30 should grow 13% to 18% in 2018, to be clear"
158,I'm glad you asked the question to clarify
159,"Yeah, the reported number, $9.2 billion, $9.241 billion is the base to grow off of"
160,"Again, you have got three moving parts"
161,You've got the sale of PS&E of about 3 points negative
162,"You've got our deferred revenue acquisition adjustment from the SunGard acquisition, and then we've got about a $75 million expected headwind from FX"
163,"So, you definitely got that right in terms of your base there"
164,We still expect that to be a decliner over time
165,"Yeah, we tried to add some color around the commentary"
166,"We believe we'll be able to prepay all our prepayable debt in 2017 and still generate excess cash flow that in late 2017 and into 2018, we could be buying back shares"
