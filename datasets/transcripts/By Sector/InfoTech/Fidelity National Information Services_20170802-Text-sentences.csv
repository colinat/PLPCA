62,"Turning to slide 19, based on the results of these transactions, operating performance and our lower tax rate, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance"
63,"Our increased range includes $0.10 of dilution from divestitures, which is more than offset by a combination of a $0.05 benefit from the impact of the debt refinance and a $0.07 to $0.12 benefit from year-to-date performance, outlook for the remainder of the year and a lower tax rate"
64,The net impact to full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance is an increase to $4.22 to $4.32 per share or 10% to 13% growth compared to prior-year period
65,I also wanted to give some insight into our expectations of the quarterly earnings spread for the second half of the year to help with modeling

70,Our revised 2017 EPS guidance does not anticipate any share repurchase impact
71,"We are pleased with the execution in the first half of the year, which allows us to increase our full-year EPS guidance, even with the divestitures"
72,"We continue to focus on consistently improving cash flow generation, deleveraging our balance sheet, investing for growth, and returning cash to shareholders"
73,That concludes our prepared remarks
74,"Operator, you may now open the line for questions"
75,Question-and-Answer Session
76,"Morning, David"
77,I'll start and let Gary add some color
78,"With regard to the leverage itself, we had talked about being in the 2.6, 2.7 range by the end of 2017, targeting getting back to around 2.5 times"
79,"That said, based on the refinancing activity we've done, we'll repay all our pre-payable or maturing debt by the fourth quarter, so we'll have some excess cash then"
80,"We certainly anticipate having some excess cash flow, significant excess cash flow, in 2018 that we could apply across a number of different ways, but we wanted to make sure we had some flexibility"
81,to do share repurchase
82,"I think we're always looking to add strategic capabilities and expand our market capabilities, but we always do that in a disciplined way, looking at financial strategic value and relative valuation"
83,"Right now, we think on a relative basis, we're a very good buy"
84,So we wanted to make sure we had access to buy some of our shares back
85,"Thanks, Dave"
86,"Yeah, I'll hit your FX first"
87,"As you know, our organic calculation excludes FX"
88,and it excludes the impact of acquisitions or divestitures
89,"With regard to FX, you're right"
90,We had a very minor impact in the second quarter
91,"And right now, based on FX rates, we are modeling a very insignificant impact for the full year"
92,Neither one of those would impact organic growth in the way we calculate it
93,"With regard to Capco, we are removing Capco from the organic base and the consulting businesses from the organic base, so they would be out of the number"
94,"But the 4% to 5%, again, removes any divestitures and removes any FX"
95,"Darrin, with regard to your first one, we've done some calcs, and we tried to give some color in the prepared remarks around what organic growth would look without the consulting business"
96,"We haven't pulled out what the impact of, specifically, of the risk-based project and some of the compares are, particularly on the EMV, because that's just ordinary business, difficult compares, and we've got to grow through it"
97,But it'll certainly help both IFS
98,"and, we believe, GFS for full year in terms of organic growth"
99,"Probably, more importantly, it helps both their margin profiles"
100,"IFS would be up to about a 40% margin with it and GFS would be in the 34%-type, which is a significant improvement from a few years ago from a structural improvement"
101,So it'll definitely help organic revenue growth
102,"It'll help margins, but we haven't specifically carved out all the moving pieces there that you just mentioned"
103,"Well, we certainly think once you move compares out, the original guides that we had, which was around 3% to 6% on IFS and 3% to 8% on GFS, still hold together"
104,"You certainly should see some improvement in acceleration in the back half of the year, particularly in the strategic segments"
105,"As you know, we were looking at about a 1 point consolidated headwind from Corporate and Other, but feel very good about the strategic segments, about the growth rates we outline, and about where they can go long-term in those sustained rates we mentioned back in May of 2016."
106,"Yeah, I think you've seen us do exactly that in the past"
107,We feel very comfortable at an aggregate 2.5 times leverage
108,"That says we grow, right?"
109,You could even take on some debt to continue to keep that leverage at that level
110,But you've seen us default to share buyback versus trying to just reduce debt lower than that
111,"So you've seen us do that a number of years, then we did the SunGard acquisition"
112,"We're getting our debt and our balance sheet back to where it needs to be, and you could certainly see us moving back into that from a default position while continuing to look at continued (32:29) opportunities"
113,"Thanks, Darrin"
114,"Thanks, Brett"
115,"Yeah, I think it is just working capital movements"
116,You've seen some timing around cash tax payments and some of the divestiture activity that we've had
117,Q2 is always our lowest cash flow generation item over the last four or five years
118,"So what we try to do is not look as much on the quarter-by-quarter cash flow generation, but look at what the total year's going to do"
119,"Through the first six months, we're at 102% and I think again we're going to be at 105% to 115%"
120,"Some of that comes through heavier cash flow at the end of the year, with renewals and license maintenance that we've always seen in the past"
121,"So feel good about it, have good visibility into it, Brett, so"
122,"I would tell you we feel very good about what we've laid out to the market, continue to take a conservative stance on the guide to make sure we are delivering our expectations, if not exceeding those expectations"
123,"So it seems like every time I put a guide together, some of the broader groups tend to get a little higher than I do in terms of picking a midpoint"
124,"But that said, I feel very good about where we're at, what we've guided to and have continued to keep a conservative stance on it"
125,Those are the two biggest chunks
126,We had a convergency in Q3 of last year that we called out last year
127,"I want to say it was around $15 million, but that's outlined in our view this year, but those are the big chunks, Brett"
128,"Thanks, George"
129,"I'll answer your second question first with regard to it not being $0.04, only being $0.01 to $0.02."
130,"The new owners put a little bit more leverage on there in terms of what we would do, and they'll continue to invest heavier as they try to grow that top line within the consulting business"
131,So you're not going to see the same amount of net income that will ultimately pick up our 40% share
132,That's the biggest delta between just picking up 40% of what we operated it at from a margin profile
133,The second would be around the discussion point around the revenue growth profile and what it looks like
134,"So, ultimately, we think it'll flow"
135,It'll flow like that
136,"Yeah, I think the tax rate itself, I think this is probably about where it needs to be, George"
137,"We had a bit of a catch-up in Q2, which is around a higher stock-based comp, higher international profits"
138,I'll caveat that with as we continue to see margin expansion outside the U.S
139,"in those lowers rate jurisdictions, we'll continue to see a lower relative tax rate than maybe some others in the business"
140,But 30% to 31% is a pretty low effective tax rate
141,That's really the only thing in the third quarter of last year
142,What you've got to think about is between the consulting sale and the PS&E sale earlier this year
143,", that's about $0.07 that was in last years' that won't be in this years'"
144,"That's partially offset by about $0.02 of debt refi, so you've got about a $0.05 delta just through divestitures this year and the timing associated with those divestitures"
145,That's the biggest issue
146,"As you did mention, last year, we had about $0.03 in the quarter related to a conversion fee in the GFS group"
147,Thank you
148,"Yeah, on that, if you go back prior to the SunGard acquisition, we were in the low 20s in terms of margin profile there"
149,"We had outlined that we anticipated our international business continue to grow and gain scale and we would expand margins through that, over time, anyway"
150,You couple that with SunGard and the consulting exit clearly is driving incremental heavier margins
151,But I would tell you we probably got 300 to 400 basis points of underlying margin improvement before you added synergies and before you got the impact from the SunGard sale
152,"As Gary mentioned, that group is up about 1,100 basis points from that timeframe, and that is a blend between synergies, the absence of consulting longer-term, and then just ongoing scale in the existing businesses that we had, even pre-SunGard"
153,"Well, I think part of it would be around the structural improvement we've talked about"
154,We're going to see some margin improvement because the consulting business has lower incremental margins
155,"With the removal of that, I would anticipate seeing better margin"
156,"And ultimately, that drives better cash flows"
157,So we're not updating our guide around that
158,", feel good about the 105% to 115%, but certainly anticipate EBITDA margins to continue to improve"
159,"And if we do what we need to, that should improve cash flows as well Unknown Speaker"
160,"And, Chris, it's Bill"
161,(50:58)
162,"The operating teams have done a very nice job of getting very focused to help lower the DSO as well, right?"
163,So we continue to want to make sure that we're collecting our cash and as timely as possible
164,So I don't know that that's a different aggressive stance
165,"I just think, to Woody's point, as you see the transformation that's occurred and the continued execution on our IP-led businesses, you're naturally seeing our DSO come down"
166,"You're seeing our free cash flow conversion trend up, and so we feel good about it"
167,It's probably in the $0.05 range
168,"As you saw, the second quarter true-up was about a $0.03 benefit, so we're actually seeing that slightly lower in the back half, so about $0.05 is a good estimate there"
