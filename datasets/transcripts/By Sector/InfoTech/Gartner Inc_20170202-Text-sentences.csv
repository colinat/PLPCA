0,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone"
1,2016 was yet another strong year for Gartner
2,"The combination of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution, and our exceptional business model saw us continue our trend of delivering double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion"
3,"On an FX neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2016 included total company revenue growth of 14%, Research revenue growth of 17%, normalized EBITDA growth of 10%, and diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition adjustments of $2.96 per share or 24% growth"
4,Our exceptional business model continues to create a consistently high level of free cash flow conversion
5,"On a rolling four-quarter basis, our free cash flow conversion was 140% of normalized net income"
6,We also continued to utilize our balance sheet to drive long-term value for our shareholders via a mixture of acquisitions and share repurchases
7,"As you know, in early January we announced our agreement to acquire CEB, an acquisition that we expect to deliver significant value to our shareholders over both the short and long term"
8,We continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe
9,"During the fourth quarter, we saw an acceleration in our contract value growth along with sequential improvements in our retention metrics and sales productivity"
10,"And as our 2017 outlook demonstrates, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth with strong cash flow generation"
11,"On an FX neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2016 included, contract value growth of 14% and Research revenue growth of 15%, Events revenue growth of 2% on a same-event basis, Consulting revenue growth of 1%, normalized EBITDA growth of 3% and diluted EPS excluding acquisition adjustments of $0.97 per share"
12,I'll now discuss our fourth quarter business segment performance and P&L in depth before turning to our balance sheet and cash flow dynamics
13,I will close with remarks on our 2017 guidance
14,Gene will then spend a few moments discussing our planned acquisition of CEB
15,And we will then be happy to take your questions
16,Beginning with Research
17,Research revenue grew 14% on an as-reported and 15% on an FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter
18,Our newest acquisitions had a less than 1 point impact on Research revenue growth for the quarter
19,"For the full year 2016, Research revenues increased by 17% on an FX neutral basis or 13% excluding the impact of acquisitions"
20,"The gross contribution margin for Research in Q4 was 68%, a 40 basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015."
21,"On a full year basis, the gross contribution margin for Research was 69% in 2016, flat when compared to the full year 2015."
22,"Building on the positive momentum that we highlighted last quarter, all of our Research business metrics remained very strong and improved on a sequential basis"
23,Total contract value was $1.930 billion as of the end of Q4 or FX neutral growth of 14% versus the prior year
24,"For reference and comparison, our Q4 2015 total contract value at current year FX rates was $1.697 billion"
25,We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business
26,"Our growth in total contract value continues to be broad-based with every region, every client size and virtually every industry segment growing at double-digit rates"
27,"Because of the breadth of our value proposition and our ability to focus on our clients' most mission critical priorities, we continue to deliver tremendous value to decision makers and businesses across the globe"
28,"Consistent with this, our retention metrics remain very strong and are near all-time highs"
29,"As Gene mentioned, client retention was 84% in Q4, stable on a year-on-year basis, and up 1 point sequentially"
30,"Wallet retention ended at 104% for the quarter, roughly flat year-on-year and up 70 basis points sequentially"
31,"New business growth remained strong, up 13% from last year's fourth quarter"
32,The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients
33,Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises
34,"We ended the fourth quarter with 11,122 enterprise clients, up 3% compared to Q4 2015."
35,"And as always, we continue to benefit from our consistent price increases and discipline around pricing"
36,"As mentioned last quarter, we implemented a price increase on November 1 that averaged just north of 3%"
37,The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow
38,"It now stands at $174,000 per enterprise, up 10% versus prior year on an FX neutral basis"
39,This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises
40,Turning to sales productivity
41,"As we discussed on our Q3 call, we projected that we would see an acceleration in our sales productivity measures in Q4."
42,"Our Q4 delivered on that, with rolling four-quarter productivity for account executive increasing by 7% sequentially from Q3 to $107,000 of net contract value increase or NCVI per AE"
43,"Over the rolling four-quarters, we delivered $233 million of NCVI"
44,That's the numerator to use in the productivity calculation
45,"The denominator is our beginning of period head count, which was our Q4 2015 ending head count of 2,171."
46,"Equally as important, our standalone Q4 2016 sales productivity increased by 12% on an FX neutral basis over Q4 of 2015."
47,"As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long-term"
48,"To sum up, we delivered another strong quarter in Research with an acceleration in CV growth and sequential improvements in both our retention metrics, as well as sales productivity"
49,Moving to Events
50,Total revenues were flat year-on-year on an FX neutral basis in Q4.
51,"On a same- events and FX neutral basis, Events revenues increased by 2% year-on-year in the fourth quarter"
52,Our Q4 Events performance was impacted by three primary factors
53,"First, several of our highest performing attendee and exhibitor sales people moved into management roles or to other parts of Gartner during 2016."
54,"While we typically experienced turnover, this was pronounced and that many of our key sales people transitioned in the same year"
55,"Second, and as we referenced on our Q3 call, we consolidated three larger applications focused events into one"
56,"The consolidation did not go as planned, and the Event performed below our expectations for both attendee and exhibitor revenues"
57,"And lastly, the year-on-year comparison in Q4 was especially tough, following the exceptionally strong 15% same-events year-on-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015."
58,"We held 14 events in Q4, one less than in the prior year quarter, and on a same-events basis, attendees were up 3% versus last year"
59,"Events' Q4 gross contribution margin was 54%, down by approximately 350 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower than expected revenues"
60,"On a full year basis, Events revenues increased by 6% in 2016 or 8% on a same-events basis and its gross margin contribution of 51% was down slightly compared to 2015."
61,As we look forward to Q1 and the full year
62,"2017 outlook, we have a fuller, more tenured sales force driving our Events business and our forward-looking indicators"
63,are strong
64,This is reflected in our 2017 guidance that calls for Events returning to double-digit growth
65,Turning to Consulting
66,"On an as-reported basis, fourth quarter Consulting revenues were approximately flat year-on-year and increased by 1% on an FX neutral basis"
67,Our labor-based business was approximately flat versus Q4 of last year with modest growth for contract optimization practice
68,"On the labor-based side, billable head count of 628 was up 4% from the year ago quarter and fourth quarter annualized revenue per billable head count ended at $372,000, which was down by 4% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis"
69,Our ongoing investment in managing partners continues to drive demand for our services
70,"We had 123 managing partners at the end of Q4, a 13% increase over the year-ago quarter"
71,"Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business ended the quarter at $104 million, down 9% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis"
72,"As we noted last quarter, our Consulting backlog benefited in 2015 from a very large contract booking in a non-target geography, which was a significant driver of backlog improvement in the year-ago quarter"
73,"Excluding this one large contract, Consulting backlog decreased by 4% year-on-year"
74,"This represents approximately four months of forward backlog, which is in line with our operational target for this measure"
75,Consulting gross contribution margin declined by 310 basis points year-on-year
76,"This was driven by two primary factors, higher than usual severance and modestly lower utilization"
77,"On a full-year basis, Consulting revenues increased by 6% on an FX neutral basis, in line with our long-term growth target range of 3% to 8%"
78,and we expect to continue this growth trend in 2017.
79,Moving down the income statement
80,"SG&A increased by 12% year-over-year in fourth quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force"
81,"As of the end of 2016, we had 2,423 direct quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 252 or 12% from a year ago, consistent with our previous guidance"
82,Moving on to EBITDA and earnings
83,"Normalized EBITDA was $145 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 3% on an FX neutral basis"
84,"For the full year, normalized EBITDA was $457 million, representing 12% growth for 2016 or a 10% increase on an FX neutral basis"
85,Moving down the income statement
86,"Depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter reflecting higher capital spending to support our growth, while acquisition and integration charges declined by 12% reflecting the impact and timing of acquisitions made in recent years"
87,"Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.4%, which is lower than the guidance of approximately 40% we gave three months ago"
88,The tax rate was lower than guidance predominantly due to a favorable impact of earnings mix and the timing of certain tax costs
89,"Adjusting for acquisition charges, our normalized tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% and is also lower than our previously issued guidance of approximately 38% for similar reasons to the GAAP rate"
90,GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.79 in the fourth quarter 2016.
91,"Our GAAP EPS figures also include $0.18 worth of acquisition and integration charges, approximately $0.05 higher than we had guided"
92,The higher charges relate to our recent acquisition activity
93,"EPS excluding acquisition and integration charges was $0.97 per share in Q4, up 5% versus Q4 of 2015."
94,"For the full year 2016, our fully diluted GAAP EPS was $2.31."
95,GAAP EPS included $0.65 of acquisition and integration charges
96,"EPS excluding acquisition and integration charges was $2.96 per share for the full year, an increase of 24% on a reported basis"
97,Turning now to cash
98,"In Q4, operating cash flow was $83 million, up 5% on a year-on-year basis"
99,"For the full year 2016, operating cash flow was $366 million, up 6% compared to full year 2015."
100,"We define free cash flow as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures with cash acquisition and integration payments added back"
101,"In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $76 million, compared to $73 million in Q4 2015, an increase of 4% year-over-year"
102,"For the full year 2016, free cash flow was $347 million, up 10% compared to full year 2015."
103,Free cash flow was modestly below our expectations due to a combination of Q4 Events performance and the timing of our CV growth
104,"Managing our business to generate strong cash flow is one of our top priorities, consistent with the negative working capital dynamics that are a key characteristic of our subscription-based business model, we continue to generate free cash flow well in excess of net income"
105,"We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, cash position and liquidity profile"
106,"As of December 31, we had gross debt of $703 million"
107,"When combined with our cash balance of $474 million, it represents a net debt position of $229 million or about 0.5 times normalized EBITDA"
108,Our current $1.8 billion credit facility runs through 2021.
109,"As of December 31, we had approximately $1.1 billion of revolver capacity"
110,Strategic acquisitions and share repurchases continue to be our primary uses of our free cash flow and available capital
111,Our number one priority remains executing on value creating acquisition opportunities
112,"During the fourth quarter, we acquired Machina Research, a market leader in research focused on the Internet of Things or IoT"
113,"The bigger news related to acquisitions clearly came at the beginning of January, with the announcement of our agreement to acquire CEB"
114,Our teams are working diligently through the necessary processes and preparing the filings and arranging the financing required to complete the transaction and start capturing value from day one
115,"Turning now to guidance, as always, we will be providing you with guidance for revenue at a total company and segment level, normalized EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow"
116,Our EPS guidance is both on a GAAP and adjusted basis with the latter excluding acquisition and integration charges
117,We'll also provide you insight into the larger line items below EBITDA that get us to our EPS guidance range
118,"Please note that all of our 2017 guidance ranges relate to Gartner on a standalone basis, and do not include any estimates related to the pending acquisition of CEB"
119,"Our guidance is consistent with our performance over the last several years, as we are again projecting at the midpoint of our guidance range, double-digit growth in revenues, EBITDA and EPS, on an FX neutral basis"
120,And we continue to invest to support our key strategic objectives and drive long-term value for our shareholders
121,"The details of our 2017 outlook are also included in today's press release, but to summarize, our base level assumptions for our guidance are as follows"
122,"Our sales force grows approximately 13% in 2017, sales productivity remains flat from 2016 levels on an FX neutral basis"
123,We have used recent foreign exchange rates in setting our guidance and outlook for year
124,"And as is our practice, we will provide updates on our quarterly earnings calls"
125,should there be any changes to any of these assumptions
126,I will begin with the details in context of our 2017 revenue guidance
127,We are expecting total revenues for 2017 of $2.680 billion to $2.745 billion or 12% to 14% growth on an FX neutral basis
128,Turning to our three business segment
129,"First, revenues for the Research segment are expected to be $2.050 billion to $2.085 billion in 2017, FX neutral growth of 14% to 16%"
130,"Again continuing our trend of mid teens growth for our largest, most profitable and most cash generative segment"
131,"Second, we expect Consulting revenues of $345 million to $360 million or 2% to 7% FX neutral growth compared to 2016 and consistent with our longer term outlook of 3% to 8% annual growth"
132,"And third, we expect to deliver Events revenues of $285 million to $300 million, 8% to 14% growth on an FX neutral basis"
133,This continues our trend of meeting or exceeding our long-term growth outlook for this segment
134,We currently expect to hold approximately 69 events in 2017 compared to 66 in 2016.
135,We expect normalized EBITDA for the full year 2017 to be between $495 million and $530 million or 9% to 17% growth over 2016 on an FX neutral basis
136,We expect the costs associated with stock-based compensation expense in 2017 to be approximately $52 million to $53 million
137,"Total depreciation and amortization should be approximately $67 million to $68 million, inclusive of the amortization of acquired intangible assets"
138,We expect acquisition and integration charges of $17 million and net interest expense of approximately $24 million
139,"For our tax rate, we are projecting an annual effective rate for GAAP of 32% to 33%, and for normalized earnings of approximately 31.5% to 32.5%"
140,"Please note that our tax rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards, as well as the timing of certain items"
141,Our GAAP EPS earnings guidance for 2017 is for EPS to be between $2.80 and $3 per share
142,This includes $0.35 per share of acquisition-related charges
143,"Excluding acquisition and integration charges, our guidance for EPS is to be between $3.15 and $3.35 per share in 2017."
144,This represents 6% to 13% growth to full year 2016 or 10% at the midpoint of the guidance range and includes approximately a 1% headwind related to FX
145,"Please note, our guidance is based on average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 82 million to 83 million shares for the full year 2017."
146,"As we discussed on earlier calls, we had a number of favorable items occur below EBITDA in 2016 that benefited earnings"
147,"These items include benefits related to equity compensation expense, tax credits and tax incentives, and the tax rate"
148,We are not forecasting those items to occur again in 2017.
149,"Normalizing for those items, the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance yields 14% EPS growth versus 2016, which is in line with the midpoint of our EBITDA growth guidance for 2017."
150,"For 2017 we are guiding operating cash flow of $385 million to $415 million, or 5% to 14% growth on a year-over-year basis"
151,We anticipate cash outflows for acquisition and integration charges to be $38 million in 2017.
152,"As a growth company, with a growing associate population, one of our larger capital expense items are real estate projects"
153,"Large real estate projects happen with varying frequency, but in 2017, we have two major projects in two important locations occurring simultaneously"
154,"Inclusive of these two large products, our capital expense guidance is for $75 million to $80 million in 2017."
155,Putting this together equates to free cash flow of $348 million to $373 million in 2017 or flat to 7% growth over 2016.
156,"Normalizing for the two major projects I just mentioned, free cash flow would be increasing by between 7% and 14%"
157,"As in prior years, our free cash flow is expected to again be well in excess of our normalized net income levels in 2017."
158,"Specifically, our guidance implies a normalized net income to free cash flow conversion range of approximately 135%"
159,"Excluding the large building related capital expenditures, our conversion rate would be approximately 145%"
160,Now I'd like to provide some additional information to allow for an understanding of the seasonality and other factors that will impact our revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis
161,Starting with our guidance for Q1 2017.
162,"If you recall, we had an unusually strong first quarter in 2016 with 81% year-on-year growth in adjusted EPS, driven by a combination of very strong growth in Events and Consulting as well as a few non-recurring below the line benefits, such as lower stock-based compensation expense that we do not expect to repeat in Q1 2017."
163,We expect that Q1 will be our lightest quarter of the year from both a total company and Events revenue perspective
164,Just to double click on Events
165,", we expect Q1 2017 revenues to be proportionally similar to Q1 2016."
166,"For Consulting, we expect to see a modest year-on-year decline in revenues, when compared to the unusually strong 11% year-on-year growth from Q1 2016."
167,"Completing the primary drivers of our Q1 EPS, we expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, and 27% on a normalized basis"
168,Both lower than our projected full year tax guidance ranges due to the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to the expected timing of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards that I highlighted on last quarter's call
169,"As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.45 and $0.48 per share in the first quarter of 2017, including approximately $0.13 per share of acquisition and integration charges in Q1."
170,"And as in past years, the fourth quarter is expected to be our largest, with more than 50% of the full year"
171,Events revenue occurring in Q4.
172,"Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange, as it relates to our reported total contract value"
173,"As we have communicated to you in the past, contract value is reported on an FX neutral basis throughout each year"
174,We do this so you can understand the true organic growth in our Research segment
175,"In early July of each year, we restate the opening contract value at current foreign exchange rates"
176,"As a result of changes in FX rates since January of 2016, contract value at January 1, 2017 is approximately $27 million lower than the $1.930 billion reported on December 31st"
177,"As a result, $1.903 billion is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when judging contract value growth in 2017 on an FX neutral basis"
178,"So before I turn call back to Gene, let me summarize"
179,"We delivered another very strong quarter in Research in Q4, capping off another strong year of mid-teens revenue growth for our largest and most valuable segment"
180,We continue to provide tremendous value to our clients and we have continued to invest and strengthen our operational capabilities
181,"In 2016, we saw improved momentum in total contract value, delivering 14% CV growth and our client and wallet retention metrics are near all-time highs"
182,"And as our 2017 outlook demonstrates, we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth with strong cash flow generation"
183,"We are in a very strong position to capture the vast market opportunity ahead of us and continue to live, to deliver long-term value for our shareholders"
184,The addition of CEB will enhance and expand our capabilities to address the most important priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide
185,We believe this will further enhance our ability to generate long-term double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion
186,"With that, I will turn the call back to Gene, who is going to share some closing thoughts on our planned CEB acquisition before we take your questions"
187,Yes
188,Good morning Anj
189,"As we've discussed all the time as we've talked about our market opportunity, we have strong conviction in the fact that we have an enormous market opportunity in all of the enterprises that currently don't do business with us and we have an enormous market opportunity even in our existing enterprises"
190,"And the continued expansion, the average spend for enterprise illustrates that the fact that there is that huge opportunity in growing our penetration within existing enterprises"
191,"In terms of the enterprise count, I would just refer you, we had a slight dip in client retention over the course of the year, which you saw come back in the fourth quarter"
192,That's going to impact that net enterprise number a little bit
193,I wouldn't read too much into it
194,"We drove really nice new business growth over the course of the year, and we did accelerate our CV growth rate over the course of the year up to 14% as well"
195,"And so as we go forward, we again, expect to see about what we have seen historically which is about two-thirds of our growth come from further penetration of existing enterprises and about one-third of our growth come from net new logos"
196,Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
197,LLC
198,Okay
199,"And one last one from me, just wanted to get your thoughts on the sales environment post-elections in the U.S"
200,"I realize there's still a lot of noise and uncertainty, but you guys have been speaking about it being a difficult environment in 2016."
201,So just wondering if you have any updated thoughts as it relates to your domestic business and internationally post-election?
202,Thanks
203,"And Gary, on the second part of your question, in terms of the tenure"
204,Two things working in our favor that actually give us positive view on the outlook for Events
205,"So number one is, we have more sales people in territory entering 2017 as compared to where we were at the same point in 2016, and we'll also get the benefit of – we hired them over the course of 2016, and so their tenure mix or seasoning will have improved as well"
206,"And as we've talked about in the past, obviously, people in their first year are not as productive as people in their second year, or not as productive as people in their third year"
207,"So the outlook for Events is really based on the fact that fuller territories, essentially a bigger army selling events and the improvement in tenure mix"
208,"Good morning, Tim"
209,The improvement we saw was broad based
210,"As we mentioned on prior calls, we have seen a rebound in Brazil"
211,"We have seen a rebound in the energy and utility sectors, which were probably the two areas – and also in the Middle East as well, which were probably the three areas that were the biggest hit"
212,That alone does not account for the acceleration in CV growth
213,"We actually saw a nice improvement in the Americas, nice improvement in Europe, nice improvement in Asia and Australia as well"
214,So it really was a combination of improvement in some of the areas that were most impacted
215,"But also a broad-based improvement as well, which ties into the inflection point comment that Gene gave, both on last quarter's call and on this quarter's call"
216,"Yes, it was small impact, less than 1 point on the overall growth rate"
217,"Important note, SCM World was in last quarter"
218,So the sequential improvement is actually full-on organic sequential improvement
219,"Yeah, Machina is very, very small, yes, very small"
220,You're right in that investment in managing partners is a core pillar of our Consulting strategy
221,"Ultimately over the long term what it will do when we get to full coverage is drive deeper, longer lasting recurring relationships that make the business more predictable, that make our utilization more predictable and at higher levels"
222,That's ultimately the strategy
223,"And as you mentioned, we've been growing the capacity to get there"
224,"As we look ahead, we're going to continue to invest in managing partners"
225,"We do believe that over the long term that will result in the things I just mentioned, which are more stable revenue growth, more stable utilization"
226,And so we would expect to see margin improvements or more attractive margins for this business over the long term
227,"Good morning, Manav"
228,"The range we give, again, we are talking about a roughly $500 million base"
229,So the range from our perspective isn't that enormous
230,It's the typical range of outcomes
231,"If we see Events performance or Consulting performance being towards the top end of their range, obviously that drives profits to the top end of range"
232,"If we have accelerated CV growth earlier in the year, that obviously can flow through and impact the earnings as well"
233,"So, it's really no change in philosophy in terms of the size of the range and no terms in philosophy in terms of the puts and takes to our overall guidance"
234,"Good morning, Jeff"
235,"In terms of the head count growth, as we have talked, we do a bottoms up planning exercise around all the territory growth we want to do at any given year"
236,"And when we did the bottoms up this year, again, we want to go faster in places that have really nice productivity that is accelerating, and we go a little bit slower in places that are having challenges"
237,"And when we did that math or did all of that analysis, from a territory expansion perspective, it netted out to 13%"
238,"As always, as we go through the year, if we are seeing productivity continue to accelerate and improve, we will go a little bit faster"
239,"If we see places where we are challenged, we will go a little bit slower in those places"
240,But our overarching planning assumption as we rolled it up from the bottom netted out to about 13% territory growth and that's what we baked into the plan
241,"In terms of the productivity assumption, Jeff you know from a planning perspective we typically – we don't plan with a hockey stick"
242,We don't plan based on hope
243,We plan based on what we've actually achieved
244,"And so from our perspective, the way to actually build the plan is, we build it based on flat productivity"
245,"As you know, if we deliver flat productivity, that's not what we're aiming for"
246,"We're aiming for consistent improvements in productivity, but from a planning perspective we always find it most prudent to go with our most recent performance"
247,Sure
248,"Good morning, Jeff"
249,"So a couple of things so, number one, as you see in the press release, and as Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, clearing HSR is obviously a big milestone and we cleared that had yesterday, which is great"
250,We're looking to file the S-4 and Proxy in the next couple of days
251,"That will be for 9/30/2016 and for full year 2015, both companies will be filing their 10-Ks towards the end of this month"
252,We will then very quickly follow up with a updated S-4 and Proxy that is pro forma combined 2016 results
253,We're in the process of working through our financing and we will be lining all that up with the milestones you should be looking at or
254,obviously HSR clearance which we just got through the required regulatory filings
255,and then we will be out marketing our financing instruments in March
256,"Again, we're targeting, we said first half of 2017 close"
257,"Ideally, that happens sometime in April, but you never know what bumps could be there from a filing or regulatory perspective, but we're on track to close as quickly as we can, and the hurdles are really around the regulatory filings and then getting out and marketing the financing"
258,There will be pro forma combined financials for nine months ended 9/30/2016 and full year 2015.
