Thank you, Diana
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today
Let me start by saying I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter
As a more nimble company, we've been able to accelerate our strategy, and we're now firing on all cylinders
With a strong start to our 2017 fiscal year, we continued to build on our track record of delivering on all of our financial commitments with discipline, focus, and execution
We've also made solid progress in positioning the business for long-term growth, and we accomplished this amidst a market backdrop that remained highly competitive
Let me take a moment to share the notable highlights for the quarter
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38, at the high end of our outlook range
We exceeded free cash flow expectations, delivering more than $700 million and returning more than $600 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends
And we grew net revenue by 4% year over year to $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in Personal Systems
We are delivering strong results because we are executing on our reinvention and driving our strategy to protect our core, prioritize growth, and invest in the future
We are doing this with a relentless focus on innovation and engineering technologies that consistently amaze our partners and customers
A perfect demonstration of this is in Personal Systems, where yet again for the third consecutive quarter the team delivered exceptional results
This is a story of innovation and execution in delivering revenue, margin expansion, and market share growth year-over-year
Personal Systems revenue grew 10% year-over-year with operating profit improvement
The last time we saw this level of revenue growth was in 2014, triggered by the XP refresh cycle
In contrast, this growth was triggered by HP's innovation engine and ability to outperform the market
I'm particularly pleased with the balanced results in Personal Systems across geographies and product segments
We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all three regions as well as in notebooks and workstations
Our focus on segmenting the market opportunities and addressing strategic pockets of growth with differentiated products has resulted in profitable share gains in both consumer and commercial
In calendar quarter four, we beat the PC market unit growth by 8.5 points, outperforming all key competitors and achieving our highest ever worldwide market share position of 21.8%
Our focus is to bring customer value and innovation to market
And because of this, we have been rewarded with share gains
This is the way we like to win
Without a doubt, our momentum can be attributed to the strongest portfolio in our history
At the Consumer Electronics Show last month, once again we took home nearly two dozen awards for products like the EliteBook x360, the world's thinnest business convertible notebook, and the ENVY Curved All-in-One desktop, the world's most immersive at 34 inches
And one key point of differentiation is security
We worked very hard to ensure that HP's PCs and printers are the world's most secure and manageable
Last week at RSA, we announced HP Sure Click, the world's only integrated browsing solution that protects HP devices from the number one attack vector, which is malware
The supplements our best-in-class security stack and is part of our HP Secure promise to customers
If you ask Ron Coughlin, HP's President of Personal Systems, about the magic within the business, he would tell you that we are continuously changing the way we create and deliver computing experiences that amaze
It is based on a unique understanding of the market and direct collaboration with our customers and partners
Several large wins this quarter resulted from these deep partnerships
Corning, a leading innovator in material sciences, and Roche, one of the largest biotech companies in the world, both depend on HP to deliver a comprehensive package for everything from desktops to workstations to notebooks
Now turning to Printing, we made great progress in stabilizing the business
Hardware revenue grew year over year in constant currency with units up 6%, bolstered by our new Sprocket product that is helping create a new category in mobile printing
The overall market was a bit better than expected, with slight unit growth year-over-year in calendar quarter four
Due to our hard work taking cost out, we were well positioned to take advantage of this market upside and placed more positive NPV units
Our installed base mix quality continued to improve, supported by share gains in value multi-function printers for the 19th consecutive quarter
We continued to deliver highly secure and innovative printing solutions for our customers and partners and had several significant wins, including one of our biggest ever with one of the world's largest providers of technology solutions to the automotive industry
And they are leveraging HP products, including the world's most secure LaserJet hardware, Care Packs, and supplies
We also saw momentum in strategic contractual areas, with strong results in Managed Print Services and continued good momentum in Instant Ink enrollment
You'll recall one of our key growth initiatives in Printing is Graphics, which delivered strong performance once again, with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency for the 14th consecutive quarter
We saw strong hardware growth in Indigo, large-format industrial, and PageWide XL, as well as growth in Graphics supplies and services
Among the many strong custom deployments is LSC Communications, a global leader in print services, who is deploying our PageWide web press to support its growing client demand, having more than 3 billion pages of capacity in its printing platform
With our continued progress this quarter, we remain confident that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of fiscal 2017. Consistent with that, total supplies revenue was down just 2% year-over-year in constant currency
As we always say, it's all about supplies, and we continued to drive a number of initiatives within the Four Box Model to return this revenue stream to growth
Also in Printing, we're on track with the acquisition of Samsung's printing business that will help to accelerate our A3 portfolio
We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions
Turning to 3D Printing, this was a milestone quarter, with our first unit shipments and revenue recognition
Customers such as Jabil, Materialise, and Shapeways have received installations, and we are tracking to our strategy to disrupt the $12 trillion traditional manufacturing market
According to Jabil, Multi Jet Fusion is one of the few technologies capable of delivering production-grade parts with cost-effective efficiency
And according to them, some of their own end customers have said they couldn't believe 3D Printing could produce that kind of quality
Overall, quarter one was a quarter of innovation and solid execution
I'm proud of the results we were able to deliver, but we're never satisfied
We see plenty of momentum, innovation, and opportunity for us to capture in both the near and long-term and are aggressively pursuing profitable share and targeting strategic growth segments
We're continuing to accelerate and deliver for our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders
And I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments going forward
Again, fantastic quarter across all of our business segments
And now, I'll turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our financial outlook
Thanks, Katy
Let me tackle it
Listen, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we remain confident that supplies revenue growth in constant currency will stabilize by the end of 2017, consistent with our Four Box Model analytics that we see
Actual performance continues to meet and it sometimes beat the Four Box Model forecast, which means that we firmly believe that the strategy that we're executing to is the right strategy and that you've seen those metrics play out inside the business results
So it gives us increased confidence as we head towards the end of 2017 that we'll stabilize in constant currency
And that's what we said we would do
The market was a little higher than the analysts had predicted, and we took advantage of that with that lower cost structure that Cathie is talking about
And then you're seeing that show up in the units at positive 6% versus last year negative 16%
It's like a 22-point spread there
Okay, I'll start, and then I'm sure Cathie will no doubt chime in here
I think Cathie answered the question on Print pretty substantially, so I'm not sure that there's much additional information to add there
We obviously invested in marketing
We invested in units, and there was some currency
We also had currency in Personal Systems, but we were also facing fairly competitive or increased prices for components
And that was a headwind to the quarter, which we overcame by effectively growing out of the problem because our cost structure was much more in line with where we needed it to be from a competitive situation
The innovation portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, more than 23 awards that we won at CES
We were leaning into that innovation, from a customer's perspective, a lot of demand for our products
So even against that cost headwind from a component level perspective, we were able to substantially improve our performance from a top line perspective
And you saw obviously Personal Systems up 10% year over year as reported or 11% in constant-currency
And that makes all sorts of sense from our perspective because we're trying to look always through the lens of a customer
And a customer-centric approach means that we try to develop technologies that make sense for a customer, whether they happen to be laser or ink-based or whatever else we have in our kit bag as opposed to being driven by technology lines, and that's why we made that alignment change
Okay, great
I think it's always helpful to answer this question in two parts
There's the short-term view of the market, and I'll get Cathie to tackle that, and then I'll give you a long-term view of how we see the PC market, and then we'll close out with the rest of your question
And more broadly speaking, if I helicopter up a little bit, I don't think our views have fundamentally changed on this business
I always like to remind everyone; it's a $333 billion market
It's very competitive and it continues to consolidate
So when we take share faster than our competitors three quarters in a row and we're executing the way we're executing but not taking share for share's sake, which we're committed to not doing, what we end up with is a business that's firing on all cylinders
More broadly, we think it's all about innovation
And as I mentioned in my initial remarks, the growth that we saw in the PC business wasn't as a result of one event
It wasn't like an XP refresh cycle
It was off the back of really strong innovation right across the portfolio, the values that the customer sees and the little sprinkles of magic that Ron and the team are adding to the product portfolio
We have to be excellent in the core
We have to continue to search for those pockets of growth as we segment the market, like commercial mobility, create categories like Sprout and x3. All of it has to be anchored in megatrends that we see changing in the market
Services and solutions make a big part of that $333 billion market
About half the market is not the core of what you think about as desktops and notebooks
It's a lot of services and solutions and attach and other devices and workstations and thin clients
There are megatrends around consumer and commercial, this OneLife, millennials, mobility and security
So doing that segmentation, operating, continuing to take costs out of the system means that we're playing our own game and we're being rewarded for it
The reception has been broadly positive on a number of dimensions, firstly off the back of our own home-grown innovation with the PageWide array and the ability to take that into the A3 line of products
But in addition to that, obviously the line that we're initially OEM-ing from Samsung but then once we complete the Samsung acquisition by the end of this year, we'll round out the portfolio
So I think across the globe, a lot of very detailed plans at a partner level, down at a customer level
I spend personal time all around the world working with the teams on the go-to-market strategy, which is every bit as important as having a fantastic product portfolio
And then we marry that together with the marketing work that Antonio [Lucio] and his team are driving, some terrific new marketing campaigns anchored around security, which is really resonating with our Customer Advisory Council and other customers and partners
You put all that together, we're really looking forward to the launch of these products, which as you mentioned, is coming up pretty quickly here
Look, when we think about Personal Systems commodities, there's really three commodities that are under pressure
It's memory, which includes random access memory as well as SDD (sic) [SSD]
In addition to that, there's batteries and LCDs
And we take a very long-term approach with our supplier base
We have long-term agreements with many of them
We do seek to leverage the balance sheet wherever it makes sense economically for us to do that
How long will this last? It's a little bit difficult to completely forecast that
But I would say from previous experience, it takes a long time to change factory output levels
And, for example, what's affecting memory at the moment is the doubling in density across most of the mobile phone market because the mobile phones are selling many more in absolute units, but the fact that they all doubled their density puts pressure on that memory market
So if you want to really adjust that, what you have to do is add capacity, and we're talking about billions of dollars of investments from the memory manufacturers
That doesn't happen overnight
So these cycles can often last quite some time and it varies by commodity, but that should be the way you should be thinking about it
Again, looking through the eyes of a customer, it increases customer satisfaction when there's not enormous price volatility in the market that encourages gray imports and all of the issues associated with that and the frustrations associated with that
So we've seen the gray marketing activity significantly reduced
We're seeing much more stable prices in the market, which is a benefit for our customers, channel partners, and our business performance
We're confident in stabilizing supplies by the end of 2017.
Thanks
And in addition to that, it would be the full execution of our strategy, not only in the core, but as well as the growth
There's A3. Think about that $55 billion market where we have less than a 4% market share today, continuing our ramp of Graphics and commercial mobility, and we've only just begun on 3D Printing where we placed those first units and revenue recced them, which is even more exciting
And the fact that our customers are telling us that the printers are performing as per our promise on speed, quality, and cost is really important
And that strategy is anchored in time horizons
The core is the here and now
Growth is the next two to three years, and future is the 3 to 10-year timeframe, and that's how we think about this business
I thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules to tune in today
I think this quarter can best be characterized as relentless execution and innovation that delivered really strong results
It's a consecutive quarter of growth, so this is the second quarter in a row of growth and solid performance
Innovation is at the heart of driving the meaningful share gains that we had
We're the pillar of stability right now in the industry, whether it's on the security dimension or innovation dimension, regardless of the market conditions
We have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on the commitments that we laid out at the security analyst meeting, and I remain convinced, as does the rest of our entire organization, that our most innovative days lie ahead of us
