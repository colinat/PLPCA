68,I’m optimistic about our future and excited that we’re just getting started
69,I will now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and our financial outlook
70,Second question was around margins over time
71,"And Katy just to reiterate the point that Cathie made to Jim’s question, the rate was slightly down this quarter but we did place sequentially many more units than we ordinarily would"
72,"And of course that bring the razorblade business model, generates returns over time, positive NPV units and a good deal for our investors"
73,"I think it’s always important to remember, Steve, we’re executing across our entire strategy, which is to cross three pillars of our core business"
74,It generates the vast majority of our revenue and operating profit today
75,"The growth initiatives around A3, our graphics business, everything is a service which will obviously provide growth opportunities for us over the next two to three years and then further out into the future over the next five to ten years, the work we’re doing around the most of computing and 3D printing, really crates an opportunity for long-term growth for our shareholders"
76,"Well, let me start sort of long-term, and Cathie might want to weigh in a little more than that"
77,"I’d still remind everybody this is still a $333 billion market that one in five machines got an HP logo on it, means four out of five don’t; that represents opportunity for us"
78,I’ve said consistently that the market is consolidating; the top four grew 3.5%
79,We grew at 2.5-point premium to that
80,"So, certainly, the big is getting bigger and we are growing much faster than the big four"
81,"And that’s really off the back of strong innovation to this lineup, I think we have ever had, we are getting incredibly positive reviews consistently"
82,"It’s a continuous transformation of the business to more profitable subcategories, finding where the heat is into the market and where we can get value for the innovation that we are creating"
83,"And in quarter four, that paid off yet again"
84,"We saw topline -- strong topline growth, sequential growth in operating profit"
85,We saw year-over-year share gains
86,"But those share gains, I’ll remind everyone and not an objective but rather an outcome of all of this work"
87,"There is no single magic pill that was all categories, all regions"
88,The channel inventory was well under control
89,We aged inventory was well-managed
90,"I think really kudos to the team both regionally within the business units, the supply chains and the functions"
91,I think we are in a very good position to compete as we go forward in this market
92,"Why don’t I sort of stop, because I know, we’ve got some new investors that have come into the stock"
93,"and I think it’s important to reiterate and recall why this transaction was important to us, given that we’ve just closed the transaction, and then Cathie can talk specifically to those numbers"
94,"First of all, we welcome the Samsung print team to our family"
95,"And for our new investors, we bought this business for three primary reasons"
96,"Firstly, the A3 market is a $55 billion market and we are underpenetrated in that market relative to the A4 market where we have very strong market leadership"
97,"The traditional A3 players operate very complex machines, if you were to break those machines down, they would -- you would see thousands of parts on the ground"
98,"The Samsung technology really disrupts those traditional copiers with copier level performance but significantly less complex machine, the thousands of parts, when you were to break a Samsung down would be hundreds of parts"
99,And this lowers the cost to operate and that translates to increased margins for our partners and/or lower cost per page for our customers
100,"So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability,"
101,"there’re certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals"
102,"Now having a very full portfolio, actually opens up A4, new A4 opportunities for us"
103,"And the third is, we now have incredible thing, we inherited more than a 1,000 top class engineers, industry-leading R&D team in laser space, includes go-to-market capability more than 6,500 patents being added to our core"
104,And I think this newly combined team is increasingly diverse and industry-leading
105,And so with that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to attract at least 12 points -- or 12% of A3 market share in the next three years
106,The other thing to remember Toni on Samsung is that still the largest portion of the composition of the revenue today is A4.
107,"You’ll recall that we acquired these assets, so the A3 capability which was still largely in an investment mode"
108,"And so, as we move more and more into the A3 market and we shift the business from transactional to contractual, that generally comes with the higher supplies attraction"
109,And so the composition of supplies over time is indeed going to change
110,"Thanks, Shannon"
111,"Of course, we were competitors up until that sort of 20 days ago"
112,"And so, you can imagine, this is somewhat of a tricky acquisition in terms of exactly how much information that we had leading into the closure"
113,"I would say, still very early days"
114,"The integration is going incredibly well; the team is incredibly focused on our customers, doing all the right things"
115,"But, we’re learning every day as we get under the covers of this business"
116,We would expect that as our team looks at best industry practice that’s got us to the position where we are today that there will indeed be opportunities to capture those synergies
117,"But, I would just say, it’s a little too early, not more than 20 days into the acquisition, to give you a lot of specifics around that"
118,"Well, I think you’ve actually summarized it really well"
119,"We focus incredibly on cost, it’s table stakes"
120,You have to be in the right cost position
121,"If you’re not on the right cost position, you don’t have the opportunity to make investments"
122,"As it relates to investments, we feel good about the investment choices ahead of us"
123,We believe we can create significant shareholder value
124,"As we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting, we have confidence in our ability to execute and hope that we’ve dropped $1 or $2 in the trust bank over the course of the last couple of years to demonstrate that we can execute"
125,"I would say that our investment thesis and process that we follow is that we identify investment opportunities across the business, we weigh them all against one another"
126,"We’re very targeted to ensure that the investments that we do make advance our strategy, so that we don’t surprise anyone with the investments that we’re making"
127,We’re very disciplined about establishing and hitting the milestones that we lay out
128,"And ultimately, generating profitable growth is what it’s all about"
129,Growth for just growth sake is not particularly fascinating
130,"I think segment by segment, we’re demonstrating that those investments are good choices, investment systems, broadly in premium and specifically in gaming are great examples of investments that we made that are paying dividends right now"
131,"Same is true for graphics and the very targeted unit placements that Cathie talked about, NPV positive units and print"
132,"3D printing has gone from a business that was nonexistent a year ago to a real business today, 65 channel partners around the globe in every single region and ecosystem that we’ve developed, partners in Deloitte and Siemens, more than 50 materials partners that are starting to look at making materials for the platform, plus the technology announcements that we made at the Security and Analyst Meeting around a lower cost color platform and the technology announcements"
133,we’ll make around metals in 2018.
134,"So, we’re feeling good about our ability to execute in the core, in the growth areas that we outlined, as well as the future"
135,We don’t break it down at a segment level
136,And I think there are better sources of data to look at how much share we’ve taken in that particular space
137,And I wouldn’t want to make our analysts redundant
138,"I would just say that this has been a material business for us that’s grown up over the last 18 months from nothing to a sizable portion, not only in terms of revenue but the gross margin that it drives, as well as the halo effect that it has on the overall brand, which I think is lifting our premium segment as well as every other segment that we had within the PC business"
139,This is an incredible franchise; it’s a growing franchise; the airier is growing
140,And there is more people that are tuning in to these battlegrounds than game 7 of the NBA
141,"So, we like being in this business"
142,and we see the growth continuing
143,I think it’s really worth reiterating why we acquired this asset
144,It was not to buy revenue
145,And I’m being pretty clear about that as is Cathie
146,We don’t chase share for share
147,’s sake
148,"And whilst the revenue is interesting, it’s not fascinating"
149,What’s fascinating for us is the incredible disruptive technology that this team invented to take on a pretty unconsolidated A3 $55 billion copier market with a better mousetrap that enables our partners to earn more money and enables a lower cost per page for our customers with a very different value proposition from a servicing perspective
150,"More than a 1,000 engineers of very rich portfolio of patents"
151,It’s all of those reasons that we’ll pay dividends over time that we’re incredibly interested in and why we acquired this asset
152,and we’re just kind of getting started in this space
153,"So, with that, I want to take the opportunity to thank you all"
154,"I have been Americanized and I understand, it is a season of Thanksgiving, and we’re between you and a turkey"
155,"So, I want to thank you for following us through the course of our reinvention journey"
156,Our results give us real confidence in the trajectory of our business going forward
157,"We’re leading in our core markets, we’re entering new growth markets and natural adjacencies and at the same time investing in the future"
158,We’ve never been more competitive
159,We remain humble and focused
160,We’re proud of the results that we’re delivering and proud that we’ve been very open and transparent and dependable
161,We think it’s been a great year of reinvention and we’re just getting started
162,Have a great Thanksgiving
