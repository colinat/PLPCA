1,"As discussed, while our overall performance in Q2 was impacted by tough markets and the external factors I discussed last quarter, we continue to drive growth in our higher margin businesses and align our cost structure with the future HPE operating structure"
2,Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 billion
3,"This includes $2.5 billion for two months of enterprise services, which is not reported in discontinued operations"
4,Revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% adjusted for divestitures and currency driven by declines in software and tier 1 server sales
5,"If you exclude software and tier 1 and consider just the future HPE, revenue was actually up 1%"
6,I'll dive into the business segment performance in a minute
7,"From a macro perspective, we continue to see competitive pricing and a challenging commodities environment"
8,Currency remained unfavorable and was an 80-basis point year-over-year headwind to revenue
9,HPE's performance in the U.S
10,was stable excluding tier 1 servers as core servers improved and strong growth and networking was offset by a challenging storage market
11,Revenue in Europe continue to be weak driven by the U.K
12,although strong results in Germany helped the region
13,"APJ was mixed with good performance in Japan and India, more than offset by broad softness in the rest of Asia"
14,"Turning to margins, gross margin of 33.8% was down 200 basis points year-over-year and down 240 basis points sequentially"
15,Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.8% was down 130 basis points year-over-year and down 270 basis points sequentially
16,"As Meg discussed EG margins were negatively impacted by increased DRAM pricing, currency, stranded costs and short-term dilution from the recent acquisitions, as well as a very competitive pricing environment"
17,I'll discuss these in further detail in context of the enterprise group
18,Combined non-GAAP diluted
19,net earnings per share of $0.35 was at the midpoint of our outlook of $0.33 to $0.37.
20,Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.25 and $0.10 was from discontinued operations
21,"Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations primarily excludes pretax amounts for separation charges of $141 million, restructuring charges of $118 million and amortization of intangible assets of $107 million"
22,"GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was negative $0.37 below our previously provided outlook range of negative $0.03 to negative $0.07, primarily due to a one-time non-cash GAAP-only valuation allowance of our U.S"
23,state domestic deferred tax assets resulting from the changes were legal structure related to the spinoff of enterprise services
24,"As a reminder, this was similar in nature to the HPE-HPI separation and discussed as part of our first quarter earnings announcements, but not integrated in our GAAP EPS outlook"
25,Now turning to the results by business
26,"In the enterprise group, revenue was down 7% in a tough market with continued commodities pricing pressure"
27,"However, EG revenue grew slightly year-over-year when adjusted for tier 1 sales, driven by several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio"
28,Aruba was up 27%
29,Three part all-flash arrays were up 33%
30,High-performance compute grew more than 40% with SGI in over 20% organically and technology services was up 3%
31,These are some of the areas of the business that we expect to drive profit expansion and topline growth for the future of HPE
32,"That said, operating margins were down 300 basis points year-over-year and 390 basis points sequentially to 8.8%"
33,The margin declines can be broken out into three categories
34,"First, we had structural changes including the year-over-year impact from our H3C divestiture"
35,We now report our remaining stake in equity interests below the operating profit statement line
36,Q2 will be the last quarter we have a significant compare issue for EG margins related to H3C
37,"Also, we now have stranded costs of our previously allocated to enterprise services, which are now hitting the enterprise group results"
38,These stranded costs are most acute immediately following the spinoff and we will quickly work them down to zero on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal year
39,"Second, we have the short-term dilution impact from our recent acquisitions of SGI, Nimble and SimpliVity"
40,We're moving quickly to reduce their costs
41,"So, all of these acquisitions are accretive in fiscal year '18 and third and most significantly, we continue to be impacted by elevated commodities cost in DRAM and a year-over-year headwind from currency"
42,The pricing environment was also increasingly difficult and hindered our ability to raise prices as an offset
43,"We anticipate the impact from commodities will remain significant in the near-term, but we believe we can begin to mitigate it as we move towards the end of the year"
44,"Given these margin pressures, we're taking significant steps to optimize the cost structure of the future HPE and believe we can drive an incremental $200 million to $300 million in cost savings in just the second half of this year"
45,"These savings will be a combination of tight control over spending and simplifying the organization through delayering and spend control actions as we become a smaller, more nimble company"
46,Server revenue declined 14% primarily due to tier 1 as we deemphasize the category to focus on more profitable areas
47,"While we'll continue to focus on strengthening our go-to-market, integrating the recent acquisitions into your portfolio and driving targeted organic R&D, we are making solid progress since our stabilization in more profitable core servers, which declined less than 1%"
48,Storage revenue declined 13% driven by continued challenging markets and tight SSD supplies
49,"However, we do expect to maintain share in the high-growth all-flash portion of the market"
50,Our all-flash array growth accelerated this quarter and was up 33% year-over-year and results were still meaningfully impacted by SSD supply constraints
51,"The supply constraints will likely linger in the near-term, which we expect to loosen towards the end of the year"
52,"Also, encouragingly, all-flash still has a relatively low penetration rate in the data center and with the recent acquisition of Nimble and the portfolio refresh announced last week, we believe we are very well-positioned to accelerate our customer's journeys to an all-flash datacenter"
53,"Networking revenue grew 14% driven by Aruba Wireless Solution, which was up over 30%"
54,Aruba was especially strong in North America with over 100 new logo wins and is expected to take more than two point of share worldwide adjusted for H3C
55,HPE's campus and branch switching business delivered mid-single digit growth demonstrating that it's combination with Aruba is working
56,"We've also stabilized the datacenter networking business, which grew slightly"
57,"Technology services, which includes our newly launched the Pointnext business as well as Aruba Services and CMS, remains a bright spot with revenue up 3%"
58,Orders also grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter giving us strong confidence that TS will grow through the current fiscal year
59,We saw a strong order performance in consulting with particular strength in network and data center as well as commercial media solutions
60,"We again improved service intensity or attach dollars per unit, which helps offset pressure from declining hardware unit sales"
61,"HPE Financial Services revenue grew 11%, its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, driven primarily by one-time lease conversions and an increase in operating lease mix"
62,We've been pleased with the performance of financial services as it has become strategically more important to our customers as they increasingly value flexible consumption models
63,"Operating profit declined 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%, reflecting the increased operating lease mix"
64,Financing volume declined 7% due to the indirect business and return on equity was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%
65,Software revenue was down 9% as declines in license and professional services more than offset growth in SaaS as the team works through a transition to Micro Focus
66,"The team continue to focus on disciplined cost controls, leading to an operating margin of 26.4%"
67,"This is a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year as reported and their improvement is over 10 points when adjusted for one-time items last year, including the TippingPoint divestiture gain"
68,And now to cash flow; free cash flow was better than expected at negative $64 million
69,"However, this was artificially high since we accrued approximately $300 million for enterprise services payroll ending March 31 that was paid by DXC and we expect to repay that in the second half"
70,The cash conversion cycle now reflects the removal of enterprise services and was negative 12 days down one day sequentially
71,"Turning to capital allocation, during the quarter we paid $107 million in dividend payments and repurchased $670 million of outstanding shares"
72,"We've now returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of fiscal year '17, aligned to our $3 billion full year commitment"
73,"Moving to our two spin merge transactions, we completed our ES CSC spin merge transactions on April 1 on schedule and on budget"
74,The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on September 1.
75,We are making progress removing stranded costs and continue to anticipate a $0.06 diluted EPS impact in fiscal year '17 with all costs eliminated on a run rate basis by the end of the year
76,"Turning to our outlook, the seasonality of EPS will be more backend loaded given the stranded costs and M&A dilution will be worked down over time"
77,"Also, the majority of the $200 million to $300 million of incremental cost savings will come in Q4."
78,"Also keep in mind that our outlook reflects the company as it stands today, with a partial year contributions from ES and a full year contributions from software, since we haven't yet closed that transaction"
79,"As is our typical practice, we will update our outlook when we close the software transaction"
80,With that we expect Q3 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.28.
81,"From a GAAP perspective, we expect Q3 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.02 to positive $0.02."
82,"For the full-year, we are holding to our prior fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook of $1.46 to $1.56."
83,"From a GAAP perspective, we expect fiscal year '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.03 to $0.07."
84,"Finally, turning to cash flow outlook, as previously mentioned, we anticipate paying DXC approximately $300 million in the second half for the ES payroll ending March 31."
85,"Also, we expect to pay DXC an incremental $300 million in the second half for agreed-upon balance sheet adjustments, primarily related to working capital"
86,This incremental payment will not reduce our overall cash balances as our ES pension funding requirements were less than expected by roughly the same amount
87,"In total, we continue to expect full year fiscal year '17 free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion"
88,"Overall while this quarter presented some challenges, like Meg, I'm confident that our plan is the right long-term strategy to position the future HPE for success"
89,Now let's open it up for questions
90,Question-and-Answer Session
91,Sure Sherri
92,"So first of all, just to remind everybody, the full-year guide includes a partial year for ES and a full year for software"
93,"So, it may be easiest to start with Q2."
94,"So Q2 we ended up with an EPS of $0.35, now $0.10 of that was related to ES, which was in discontinued operations"
95,"So, when you move from Q2 to Q3, that's relatively flat and basically what you're seeing there is the impact and the pressure from the stranded costs, from the short-term dilution of the acquisitions and some of the commodity cost pressures"
96,Those are being offset by the second-half cost actions okay
97,"And then to your point, when you go from through 3Q to 4Q, you'd see that would imply about a $0.19 improvement quarter-over-quarter and there is really three elements to that"
98,The first one is just typical seasonality
99,"So, if you were to go"
100,"look at last year's results, we saw a similar uplift in Q3 to Q4."
101,"Same thing in 2015, we would anticipate that same type of lift due to seasonality in Q4 of this year"
102,"If you just think about the software business as an example, Q4 is typically much higher than Q3."
103,The second component of it is as we eliminate the stranded costs and as we get right size
104,"the cost envelopes around the acquisitions, that will be favorable in Q4 and then thirdly, is a $200 million to $300 million of cost out"
105,"So, the way I would think about that is roughly a third of that will come in Q3 and then two thirds of that will come in Q4"
106,and that's what's going to drive the remainder of the lift
107,So that's why you see that ramp up in Q4.
108,"We don't really give BU specific guidance on the margins, but yeah,"
109,I would say servers is driving a component of that and
110,again the way I think about it as we talked about in the prepared remarks
111,is there's a component of that that's structural
112,There's a component of that that's one-time cost
113,"and then you have the operational headwinds, which is primarily the commodities cost increases"
114,"Again, most of that is memory"
115,So that has a heavy impact on the server margin
116,Okay
117,I think there are a few questions in there
118,"So, let me see what I can do"
119,"So, I think to your point, we did on the Q1 call, we did think that revenues would stabilize"
120,"We did not say that margins would stabilize and again if you're going through a quarter-over-quarter walk, to your point, stranded cost is a big element of that"
121,We did not see that in Q1 obviously because we just separated the ES business in March
122,"So, all the overhead that we were allocating to ES in Q1, a lot of that was being allocated to EG"
123,There is some FX impact
124,"Again, we were hedged from an FX perspective in Q1 from the prior hedges that we put on in Q4."
125,"So, there was some pressure driven by that"
126,"There was also some dilution in the acquisitions which we really didn't -- we didn't talk about in Q1, nor did we have that pressure"
127,That gave us some pressure from an overall margin perspective
128,DRAM is causing a pressure point
129,We did know about that in Q1.
130,"To your point, we talked about that"
131,"Obviously, that's why we took our guide down, but if you look at memory costs in 2Q, they're actually up another 10%"
132,"So, we saw a big increase in Q1 that was when we got the 40% and 50% lift, but those have continued to go up in Q2."
133,So that drives some incremental pressure
134,"And then from a pricing point, we did go out with global price increases, but to be honest with you, the results were mixed"
135,We saw some traction in APJ and those came in in line with what we thought they would
136,"When you look at the Americas, we did not gain as much traction as we had anticipated, particularly in the U.S"
137,and that's driven by some very difficult competitive behaviors and challenges
138,We saw those same types of competitive dynamics in EMEA as well
139,"So, the overall pricing mitigation that we had talked about I'd say came in lighter than we had expected"
140,And then lastly you have typical seasonality from Q2 to Q1 or from Q1 to Q2.
141,So that's driving a lot of the variation from quarter to quarter
142,"Now to get to your question on product margins, yes if you look at TS, the good news with TS is it's been very stable over the years not only from a revenue perspective but also for a margin perspective"
143,"So, we expect that stabilization to continue as we go forward"
144,"Given the pressures that I just walked through between stranded costs, short-term dilution, DRAM pricing, yes, margins were pressured in Q2 and product margins would be negative"
145,"Now as I think about how do we progress going forward and to Meg's point earlier, we think 2Q is going to be a low point"
146,"and basically that's driven by the fact that one, we're going to work out the stranded costs"
147,"Again, those will be that zero on a run rate basis"
148,"By the time we exit Q4, we will have time to right size the cost envelopes to the appropriate levels on the Nimble and SimpliVity acquisitions and then lastly, we've got the $200 million to $300 million of cost that we've targeted to come out in the second half"
149,"Again, I think a third of that will come out in Q3 and two thirds of that will come out in Q4."
150,"So, as we take those cost out and the other thing that we should get is we should get a mix lift"
151,"As we continue to grow the higher margin businesses, HPC up 20% organically, all-flash array up 33%, Aruba up 27%"
152,"Obviously, those parts of the portfolio carry a higher margin"
153,"So, we should get a margin lift going forward"
154,So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color
155,"So, I'll answer the first piece and then Meg you can jump in here"
156,"From a cost perspective, the $200 million to $300 million is incremental and it is all in the second half"
157,"So, as you know, we're always looking at cost"
158,Now we're trying to be
159,"and we continue to be very sensitive to protecting our R&D, protecting our sales costs"
160,"But net-net, particularly given the spinoff and now the fact that we have 110,000 fewer people and we've had a little bit of time under our belt to operate in the new model if you will, we do think there are opportunities and there are going to be opportunities in the usual suspects"
161,"So, if you think about just tighter spending around travel, around optimizing programs spend, around tighter policy enforcement, we think there's more work to do there"
162,"and we can continue to do that, but there's also an opportunity to simplify"
163,"So, if you think about now as a standalone or as a remain co"
164,"if you will, you have the global structural versus the regional, versus the country"
165,"You have spanning control, you have all those types of things"
166,Those are the things that we're having better line of sight on and that's some of the cost that we will address in the second half the year and Meg
167,do you have anything else to put on it?
168,"As synergy comes online, as we continue to grow particularly if you think about high-performance compute and some of the areas of the portfolio, again excluding tier 1, from a year-over-year component, we would expect to return back to growth in the latter part of the year"
169,"So, I'll give it a shot and Meg"
170,you can jump in here
171,"So again, I think our strategy is still the same"
172,"We are going to continue to focus on organic investments because where we do that well and we do it right, it's good for customers"
173,", it's good for shareholders, it's good for partners"
174,", it's good for employees"
175,We always continue to look at share buybacks
176,"Obviously, we're bias toward share buybacks right now"
177,And then we're going to continue to look at M&A as long as it fulfills gaps in our strategy
178,"So, the way we think about M&A again as being very consistent"
179,"and it's all around complementary IP, where we can leverage our distribution and drive profitable growth"
180,"So, it's all returns based"
181,That a framework that's worked well for us in the last 12 to 18 months and
182,I would expect us to continue to operate within that framework going forward
183,"So, if you look at Remain Co"
184,and again I'll take you back to Sam
185,", we guided a $1.25 to $1.35 from an EPS perspective and we had normalized free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion"
186,"Now obviously we took that number down or we took our number down in total by $0.12 that was in Q1 that was driven by some of the FX pressures we saw, some of the commodity cost pressures we saw as well"
187,some execution issues that we were working through
188,"So, as I look at those three categories, those were all primarily EG related"
189,"So, I would adjust the $1.25 to $1.35 by that $0.12"
190,and then I would also adjust your $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion of normalized free cash flow
191,I would take that down to roughly $2 billion of normalized free cash flow to reflect the earnings pressure
192,So that will give you sort of a baseline as we exit '17 of about $1.13 to $1.23
193,and I think there are two or three areas that are going to impact that you need to think about as we move forward
194,The first one is commodity cost movements and the corresponding pricing mitigation
195,"Again, as we talked about earlier we are making traction in that we anticipate an APJ, but we're finding it very difficult in the Americas and EMEA"
196,"So, depending on how that equation plays out, that would have an impact on your baseline"
197,"From the second-half cost actions, the $200 million to $300 million that we talked about, to the extent that a piece of that is recurring, which we would expect, that would also impact your baseline going forward"
198,"and then when you look at the rightsizing, the cost envelopes particularly around the acquisitions"
199,", that should provide a little bit of accretion going forward"
200,So that's how I would think about the baseline for Remain Co
201,from both a cash and EPS perspective and we will give much more guidance and clarity and visibility at SAM in October
202,"Yes, sure"
203,"So, from a converged perspective, I think the converged part of the portfolio was down roughly 8% and traditional was down roughly 20% and then from a material perspective, really the supply constraints are much more around SSD and again as that market is very tight right now, we're getting our fair share of supplies, but given the complexity of our broad product portfolio, we're finding it challenging to what we call demand shift"
204,But we would expect that to loosen up in the second half of the year particularly as 3D yields improve as well as more factories come online
205,So that should loosen up in the second half of the year
206,"And then from a cost structure perspective ballpark, I think roughly half of that $200 million to $300 million is more of the discretionary type stuff like policies, like travel and then the other half is labor related and within that labor piece, I'd break it out into two components"
207,"I think half of that is really around lowering our rehire rates, taking a look at contractor"
208,"So, when you think about the cost to do those things, there really is no cost to do that"
209,and then there's the remaining 25% that would be more structural
210,and that's why we're evaluating the restructuring that we have in 2018 employing forward
