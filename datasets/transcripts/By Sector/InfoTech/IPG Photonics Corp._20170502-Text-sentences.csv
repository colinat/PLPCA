0,"Thank you, Valentin"
1,"And good morning, everyone"
2,"Before I begin my comments on the quarter, I would like to make a few opening remarks"
3,"First, I would like to welcome Jim Hillier, our new Vice President of Investor Relations"
4,"Quite a few of you have met Jim already, and we believe he will be a valuable addition to the IPG team"
5,"While Angelo Lopresti, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, no longer needs to make the introductory comments on these earnings calls, he remains actively engaged in our Investor Relations process, and a valued member of the IPG senior leadership team"
6,I would also like to thank Sharon Merrill Associates for 10 great years of IR advisory service to IPG
7,"Finally, I want to draw your attention to the financial data workbook posted to our Investor Relations website in conjunction with our earnings release"
8,The Excel-based model contains IPG historic financial results and key metrics over the last 10 years
9,We hope you find this to be a valuable resource as you update or build your financial models on IPG
10,"Because much of the data we typically review in our prepared comments can be found in this model, I will focus our prepared comments on the key highlights and significant changes during the period"
11,We believe this change in format will enable us to spend more time addressing your questions on our earnings calls
12,"Turning to the results, first quarter revenue grew 38% to a record $286 million"
13,Materials processing sales increased 33% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 92% of total sales during the quarter
14,"Year-over-year growth rates accelerated in applications for cutting and welding, our two largest end markets, while marking and engraving grew by a single-digit percentage, year-over-year"
15,"Notably, fiber laser sales for welding applications were at a record level, growing nearly 60% versus the year ago period"
16,Sales to other markets were up 140% year-over-year driven by strength in telecom and advanced applications
17,Menara generated $5 million revenue during the quarter
18,"China, our largest geographic region from a revenue standpoint, was also among our fastest growth areas, up 89% year-over-year"
19,"We believe this is being driven by secular growth across several different industries, multiple applications, and a healthy consumer electronics investment cycle"
20,"In addition, China-based machine tool customers are rapidly adopting our high power fiber lasers as the product of choice for their cutting systems due to the faster performance, lower power consumption, greater versatility and higher reliability of our solutions over conventional lasers and other competing products"
21,"As Valentin noted earlier, we have invested considerable resources in China to enhance our sales coverage, our service capabilities and our applications development work"
22,"We believe these investments are enabling us to better identify opportunities, build and expand customer relationships and enhance our overall execution"
23,"In the first quarter, we saw some results from our investments through new OEM customer wins and displacing other fiber laser makers at other customers"
24,"Beyond China, other areas of strength included career in Russia, where we are gaining sales in the cutting market"
25,", welding sales were particularly strong this quarter, the result of considerable work done by our application engineers to demonstrate the power performance and flexibility of our solutions within advanced automotive welding applications"
26,"In Europe, despite a subdued auto market, we saw strong growth driven by high power laser sales into cutting applications"
27,Sales in Japan were down double digits due to seasonal softness and expected lower volume at one of our largest cutting OEMs due to the timing of orders
28,We expect sales in Japan to rebound during the remainder of the year
29,"High power laser sales increased 42% year-over-year to a record $168 million, driven by cutting and welding applications"
30,"A key element of our strategy is to drive an increase in demand for high power lasers in new and existing applications, which we believe will expand the total market for our fiber lasers over time"
31,"QCW was another standout in the quarter with record sales of $21 million, growing 148% year-over-year from strength in fine welding for consumer electronics applications and percussion hole drilling for aerospace applications"
32,We are encouraged by the rapid growth of QCW in the quarter and expect another strong quarter in Q2.
33,"However, a moderation in the consumer electronics cycle with the completion of key capacity additions later this year, for example, would cause our rate of growth in QCW to slow"
34,Medium power laser sales declined 13% due to decreased demand for fine-cutting applications and the transition to higher power lasers at one kilowatt and above
35,"Working our way down the income statement, gross margin of 55% was down 20 basis points from Q1 2016 and at the top of our guidance range of 50% to 55%"
36,"We were able to largely offset declines in average selling prices with, one, improved manufacturing efficiency; two, component and material cost reductions; and three, a larger proportion of our sales coming from high power CW, high power pulsed and QCW lasers which carry a higher gross margin"
37,"First quarter operating income was $101 million, or 35.5% of sales, compared with $70 million, or 33.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year"
38,"Excluding foreign exchange, operating margins increased to 37.1% from 36.2% in Q1 of 2016 as we leveraged our costs over higher sales volume"
39,"As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 3.8% from 3.9% in the same quarter last year"
40,"R&D expenses decreased to 8% from 8.4%, and G&A expenses decreased to 6.2% from 6.7%"
41,"We were able to achieve leverage in all three areas, despite higher spending related to product development, new applications and manufacturing processes, as well as the expansion of our sales force"
42,Our tax rate in the first quarter was 26%
43,The tax rate in Q1 2017 was lower due to the adoption of the revised accounting guidance whereby the excess tax benefit arising from equity grants is now recognized in net income
44,"This benefit was $4 million in Q1, and benefited the tax rate by 4 percentage points"
45,"In Q2 we expect the tax rate to be approximately 30%, excluding any effects relating to equity grants"
46,Net income for the first quarter increased by 51.9% to $75 million
47,"On a diluted per share basis, we reported $1.38 for the first quarter compared with $0.92 a year ago"
48,"In Q1 2017, the foreign exchange loss decreased EPS by $0.06 as compared with the same quarter last year decrease of $0.06."
49,"While the change in accounting standard related to stock option exercise tax benefit increased EPS by a net amount of $0.07, including the impact of the increase in diluted shares related to the same accounting standard"
50,"If exchange rates, relative to the U.S"
51,"dollar, had been the same as one year ago, we would have expected revenue to be $10 million higher, gross profit to be $7 million higher and operating expenses to be $1 million lower"
52,"We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $863 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and $40 million of debt"
53,"Our current level of inventory on hand amounts to approximately 183 days, which is just slightly above our target range of two turns, or approximately 180 days and above the 2016 year-end level of 176 days"
54,"Days sales outstanding was 57 at quarter-end, compared with 51 at the end of Q4 2016 and 64 days a year ago"
55,Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $51 million
56,"The $14 million decrease in operating cash flow versus Q1 2016 primarily stems from a $31 million increase in cash used for receivables, and a $19 million increase in cash taxes paid"
57,"Receivables, which are impacted by the timing of when revenue is recognized during the quarter, can fluctuate from period to period"
58,Cash taxes can also fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of estimated tax payments
59,It's also worth noting that Q1 operating cash flow tends to be below the annual run rate due to the payment of cash bonuses during the quarter
60,We expect to see a significant increase in operating cash flow during the remainder of the year
61,"Capital expenditures totaled $22 million for the quarter and we continue to expect $90 million to $100 million of CapEx for the full year including up to $15 million to upgrade our corporate aircraft, net of proceeds from selling the existing one"
62,"During the quarter, we purchased 108,000 shares for $13 million as part of our share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee and director equity compensation and employee stock purchase plans"
63,"We have now repurchased 210,000 total shares for $21 million since the program began last July"
64,Moving on to guidance
65,"For the second quarter of 2017, we expect revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million"
66,We anticipate Q2 earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.50 to $1.70.
67,The midpoint of this guidance represents quarterly revenue and EPS growth of approximately 31% and 28% respectively year-over-year
68,The magnitude of our Q1 outperformance and current Q2 revenue guidance has exceeded our expectations when compared to those assumed in our annual guidance of 10% to 14% revenue growth in 2017.
69,"As such, we believe the stronger than expected performance and guidance for the first half of the year should be treated as additive to our full year revenue growth outlook"
70,"However, it should not be used at this time as an assumption for outperformance in the second half of the year"
71,"While order flow remains strong, our visibility into the back half of the year particularly Q4 remains somewhat limited"
72,"As discussed, in more detail in the Safe Harbor passage of our news release today, actual results may differ from both our full year and quarterly guidance due to various factors including but not limited to product demand, order cancelation and delays, competition and general economic conditions"
73,"This guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations and is subject to the risks outlined in the company's reports with the SEC and assumes exchange rates relative to the US$1 of €0.94, RUB 56, ¥112 and CNY 6.9, respectively"
74,"As a reminder, we do not attempt to forecast changes in foreign exchange rates"
75,"With that, Valentin and I will be happy to take your questions"
76,Question-and-Answer Session
77,When we look at that we're looking at the midpoint of the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year and adding the outperformance in
78,We get to a slightly lower number than that
79,"If you went to 25%, Patrick, you'd be factoring-in continued outperformance in the second half of the year which at this point in time we're not providing guidance around"
80,I think one of the challenges as well is you had an exceptionally strong Q4 a year ago when the momentum that we're seeing now really started to pick-up
81,"That started in Q3, accelerated into Q4."
82,So we're bearing in mind that we actually have a pretty difficult comparison in Q4.
83,"Nonetheless, the thing that we do want to call out is that order flow right now remains very strong through April and that's reflected in the Q2 guidance and the strength of order flow through Q1 is reflected in that as well"
84,So I'm not going to get drawn on the 25%
85,"I think I've given enough color around that, but if you add the amount that we estimate should be added to the midpoint of the original guidance, it's quite a bit below that 25% number"
86,"So first of all, I think the kilowatts of units sold was up by about –"
87,kilowatts of power sold was up by 60% and then valves in reference unit sales up by approximately 70%
88,So you've got a couple of trends that we're seeing there
89,"First of all, yes, some degradation in ASPs particularly compared to Q1 a year ago"
90,"The ASP situation has been much more stable recently, but within that trend you've also got a couple of interesting things"
91,"First of all, ASPs can be impacted because the actual increase in 6 kilowatt and 10 kilowatt lasers, the ASP per kilowatt on those is slightly lower"
92,We've also seen unit volume increases in the 1 kilowatt and 2 kilowatts driven by some of the fine processing cutting customers in China and particularly moving up from 500 watts and 700 watts to our compact YLR 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt lasers and we've also seen in the 3D printing and additive business a transition from some of the medium power to the 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt lasers for that
93,So those would also contribute to the increase in unit volumes at the lower power levels
94,So there's a number of different dynamics that are happening there
95,I'd say the really pleasing aspect of that is the general move up in power across several different applications
96,and then the real acceleration that we're seeing in the 6 kilowatts to 10 kilowatts and now with customers demonstrating 12 kilowatts cutting systems
97,30% is the number
98,Thank you
99,So the color we've given around this is that order flow remains very strong
100,"We're choosing at this point in time to not give guidance on Q3, but state that the outperformance in the first half of the year should be added to the initial guidance that we gave"
101,"If order flow remains where it is, we're going to have – just talking about this in a qualitative manner, a good strong Q3 performance as well"
102,I mentioned that order flow through April was in no way diminished from what we saw in the first three months of the year
103,"And, so the overall trends behind the business are very strong"
104,We're choosing to give the guidance on Q2 rather than get drawn into the second half of the year at the moment
105,"When we get to having that visibility in the second half of the year, if necessary, we'll provide an updated range to annual guidance"
106,"I'd say, overall the tone of the business is as good as I've seen it, even though we've performed very well over the last couple of years"
107,It's been an extraordinary period for us
108,"and I think that just is a testament to the execution, the quality of the product, as we've mentioned, and the acceleration of the adoption of fiber as compared to other technologies"
109,"Do you want to talk to that, Valentin, a bit more?"
110,"The core business is still fundamentally driving the revenues at the moment, so the newer products are still really just starting out"
111,We mentioned some sales of the RGB for the cinema
112,"That was a few units, but it was good to see that happen"
113,so it was a very small contribution
114,"There's some acceleration in the telecom business which is helping a little bit, but that's more"
115,I'd say a thin layer of icing on a large cake at the moment
116,"So if we can continue to execute around getting these newer products into the market, into addressing a broader part of the micromaterials processing business, we are seeing some penetration in micromaterials processing even with our core 1 micron product, but we hope to see significant improvement in that with some of the ultra-fast product and the UV applications"
117,So there's still – you know the great thing is
118,", there's still not much contribution from those"
119,And when they start to come to bear on revenue it should be a good backup that we have
120,"I think competition is finding it extremely difficult to compete across the leading edge of the technology of the product, which drives the different performance parameters in terms of electrical efficiency being one, beam quality,"
121,"the tremendous scale that we have on manufacturing, the service and support we have around the world, the application laboratories that support that service and sales, the investment that's gone into that"
122,All of those things put us in a pretty enviable position
123,"I think in terms of applications, a couple of the highlights are the welding, whilst it can be a bit uneven, quarter-to-quarter depends a bit more on projects"
124,They're starting to get some more momentum into it
125,And it's not just the consumer electronic cycle spend this year
126,"We talked about some of the automotive and other areas, for example pipe welding"
127,"On the cutting side, I think this is a difficult thing to state without – there's very little data behind it, but one of the things we've said is that you shouldn't just focus on the annual sales of high-powered lasers for cutting applications"
128,You should look at how deeply penetrated fiber is into the installed base
129,"And there are different numbers in terms of total in store base of cutting systems, 60,000-plus of them around the world"
130,Fiber a year ago was probably less than 30% of that installed base
131,"Now we're being not as aggressive maybe, only 25%"
132,"We think there's an acceleration of the replacement of some of the older CO2 lasers, because job shops just cannot be competitive with that technology as more and more fiber lasers are deployed in the field"
133,Right?
134,So they're increasing against job shops that have a fiber laser
135,"The CO2, even if it's older and fully depreciated with its high maintenance and running costs, is just no longer a viable alternative"
136,And we've seen that commentary coming out of a couple of surveys that we've seen
137,So it's a number of different things across different applications
138,"Then you've got some of the other applications in ablation, the cleaning, the hole-drilling was a good contributor on the QCW"
139,So the QCW wasn't just welding
140,"And these are all area that we're looking for growth, so it's across a variety of different things that we're succeeding at"
141,So the great thing is that it's across a variety of applications and
142,a lot of those applications are generally sort of organic with what we think are sustainable trends in the market
143,"And the one thing that's just – is always a two-year cycle is the consumer electronics stuff, but certainly the outperformance that we're showing in the first half of the year isn't just driven by that"
144,That's really no – a relatively even small part of it
145,"Of course, that's probably a bit of a thicker layer of icing on the cake than the newer applications, but it's not just that"
146,"It is the cutting and the welding, those ablative processes, the drilling, which is a shift that you're seeing across a variety of different industries"
147,"So it's difficult to call it out for next year yet, but we think we're in an exceptionally strong position relative to the other technologies and even non-laser technologies at this point in time"
148,"We continue to remain in that range of 50% to 55% and are very, very pleased with executing at the top end of that range"
149,We've mentioned that you're always trying to balance the declines in ASPs across different product lines with new product introductions and getting a benefit from the higher power lasers in different product categories that we get to
150,We also are adding manufacturing capacity
151,Valentin mentioned that we've got a tremendous uptick in unit and kilowatts of power that we have to keep up with
152,"So you also try to balance your manufacturing efficiency with the semi-fixed labor costs that are brought on, the fixed costs that are brought on with increasing depreciation as you're placing buildings and equipment into service"
153,So I'm delighted with where gross margins are at this point in time
154,I think Valentin would probably second that
155,"On the cost side, I think one of the interesting things here is that we think the market price of diodes is still around $10 per watt"
156,"Of course, some company's manufacturing is below that"
157,Our bill of material fully loaded on a large part of our kilowatt lasers is now at less than the market price
158,But the entire bill of material on a cost per watt basis is less than the market price of diodes at the moment
159,"So if nothing else, that should be taken as a point to tremendous advantage to the company"
160,We didn't disclose any backlog information
161,"As usual, the sort of strength on order flow is really reflected in the guidance number"
162,It's pretty similar to what we're seeing in Q1.
163,We'll get another good quarter out of China showing strong year-over-year growth
164,The momentum in Europe continues to be good
165,You'll see a pick-up in Japan in Q2.
166,"Less meaningful, but good backlog in Korea and Russia"
167,as well has a good opening backlog
168,So there's no fundamental change
169,", it's just a continuation of the overall trends"
170,Nothing in particular
171,"I think it's just waiting for the overall trends on order flow through end of Q2 and into the beginning of Q3, seeing how those are going to materialize"
172,You can see – in about 50% of the time you see Q4 being lower than Q3.
173,"And that's generally driven by in those years where you have a strong consumer electronics cycle you can see China revenue a bit lower in Q4, so we'll watch that"
174,"But, we watch everything, Bobby, in terms of the different geographies and applications"
175,"So automotive, I think, is strong, and it's certainly strong and weaker, stronger in some areas and weaker in others"
176,"So, the real strength on automotive at the moment is North America and China, in particular"
177,"Europe's okay, not showing tremendous growth year-over-year on the automotive applications"
178,"And Japan might be an area, where we're starting to get some indications from some of the major customers there that maybe in the second half of the year, the automotive investment cycle may start to improve there where it's been – I'd call Japan as well sluggish like Europe over the last year or so"
179,"But, you're right"
180,", we don't have – it's not like the traditional OEM business where you can rank your predictive visibility more fundamentally"
181,Sorry
182,"I think we've disclosed in the K, and this is very approximate number because I could caution you again, the application date that we get sometimes is not the most accurate, but in all cutting applications both high-power and mid-power and even some of the QCW is about 50% of total revenue"
183,"The welding is about 20%, and then marking and engraving will be the next biggest application after that"
184,"The two main ones, cutting and welding at those levels"
185,"And that's, of course, multiple products,"
186,"Joe, not just high-power"
187,Trends on cutting continue to be very strongly
188,"We continue to see the displacement of the installed base of lasers and then move towards higher power, both with fine metal and that should continue to provide some sustained growth for the company"
189,"Clearly, the welding market is one that we have called out"
190,"We see that over a three-year horizon as being a fundamental area, where we want to execute not just on high-power but on QCW as well"
191,"In terms of like a three to five-year time horizon welding, the welding market we're targeting and growing substantially by displacing not only existing laser, but non-laser welding technology as well"
192,Yeah
193,"I think that's part of it to continue to gain traction with those relationships, continuing to compete fiercely against even the local companies like Raycus and other competitors there"
194,"You've actually seen also a rebound in the business with our largest OEM there this year, and that's benefiting from recovery in their cutting markets"
195,"So, that customer continues to be very much sourcing their fiber laser technology at high-power and QCW from IPG"
196,"So there's different end market dynamics there, so you've got the welding market for EV, electronic vehicles, for batteries and other applications continues to be a driver too"
197,It definitely has continued through April
198,"There's clearly a surprise with the strength with which China started at, because you always think that in January, China orders are going to be slow before China New Year"
199,"And that order flow is very strong, and then it carried on through February and March"
200,"So yeah, it's difficult to quantify like clearly relative to guidance and the outperformance, you can see how much of a surprise that has been to us"
201,"I think sometimes the inflection points on the upside, Jim, are some of the most difficult things to forecast, regardless of how good your relationships are with the OEMs."
202,I think the OEMs themselves find it very difficult to forecast sometimes the adoption curve that they see on some of the applications
203,"For example, the move towards higher power levels"
204,"And that's not just in China, it's even in Europe as well"
205,No
206,"Fundamentally, I think that this is pleasing"
207,"Actually, you'll see our former largest customer will report some stronger sales this year"
208,"So relatively speaking, a little bit more of a concentration there, but also as Valentin mentioned, many new OEMs across a variety of applications as well"
209,"It's only thing, that's having a benefit"
210,You're seeing overall
211,I think global PMIs are at or close to five-year highs
212,They're at that level coming into the end of the year and through Q1.
213,You continue to see some improvement in the European economic environment
214,And there's a bit more momentum there
215,The U.S
216,economy clearly at the moment is pretty strong
217,China credit remains available
218,"So yeah,"
219,"I think the global economies is as strong as it has been for a while, and that helps with the industrial investment cycle"
220,Yeah
221,We're not big on telecom in China at the moment
222,It's a very small part of our business
223,Most of our telecom is outside of China
