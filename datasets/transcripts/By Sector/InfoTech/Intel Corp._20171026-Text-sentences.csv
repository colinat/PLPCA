80,This puts us solidly on track to deliver the best year in the company's history for the second year in a row
81,"And with that great news, I'd like to hand it over to Bob"
82,"Hi, Ross"
83,So let's talk about this
84,We can kind of break this down
85,"So, first, we are already seeing the benefits of AI in that"
86,"Remember, as I said, we lead in inference, which is the actual application of artificial intelligence, and we're continuing to really grow in that space"
87,"I think AI, if you take a look at it in general, machine learning, it's the smallest segment to a workload if you look at the data center, but the fastest growing"
88,So you're going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business
89,"You're seeing the effects in our numbers already around Xeon, Xeon Scalable, the FPGAs; we talked about the Microsoft Brainwave launch that's occurring"
90,"So those products you're going to see, I'll call those more of our traditional products"
91,"And also at the lower end, outside the data center, things like Movidius and now Mobileye, you're seeing those hit our P&Ls as well real-time now as we speak"
92,"The other products like Nervana, you'll start to see really more towards the back end probably of 2018 from a P&L perspective"
93,"If you take a look at Nervana, it actually – we get our first silicon out"
94,It will be handed out as test silicon
95,"We have a yearly cadence of products, and so I expect the first substantiations to be more people figuring out how to use it"
96,It won't be a big impact
97,"But as we go through next year and move on beyond that and get the second generation and beyond, that will grow, we believe, quite considerably"
98,"And then products like Loihi, which is our neuromorphic, are same things"
99,"The part we've put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and learn how to program with neuromorphic, which is a very different type of machine learning"
100,"It lets you learn at hundreds of times faster rates than traditional, I'll say, GPUs and CPUs, especially around visual learning"
101,Those as well you'll start to see late next year and beyond as people really begin to learn how to program with these
102,So seeing it already and those newer products really think late 2018 and beyond before they really start to hit P&Ls
103,"I'll start and Bob can jump in, Stacy"
104,"First, because you've got a couple questions in there, what I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just really started"
105,It starts with the big cloud service providers
106,You saw Google talk about it a couple weeks ago
107,You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week
108,Those ramps are just beginning
109,I talked about the 200 design wins or design-ins at customers
110,"Those are just starting to come out, so we're really early"
111,"These ramps, remember because we have to – it will go through the cloud service providers and the Tier 2 cloud service providers, then on into comms and eventually into enterprise as well"
112,This is going to take a year or more
113,So I think it's early to make this judgment
114,The ramp is right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product
115,"The second part of your question, is 7% high single digits, I'll just make it simple and say look, if you look mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single digit number"
116,I'm not going to – the math doesn't lie
117,"Sure, we don't separate out inference"
118,So what we said is simply in the past publicly that AI is one of the smallest workloads and in fact one of the fastest growing
119,We haven't broken out – beyond just saying here's what cloud is growing at and
120,here's
121,what comms
122,and here's
123,"what enterprise, we don't break out by workload"
124,And there's a variety of reasons for that
125,"Part of it, it's sometimes hard"
126,"The mixture of what – when somebody goes out and builds a rack, what is it going into?"
127,How much of its workload is really being used by AI?
128,"Anybody who tells you exactly what that number is, is just wrong, to be honest with you"
129,So it's very hard for us to say with precision that X percent of our units went into AI workloads because it's rare that a rack is purely AI except for rare cases
130,"But we know that it's small, just by the type of interactions we have, but also fast-growing and one of the biggest areas of interest"
131,So you've captured it quite well
132,Let's just talk about this
133,We can talk about it from a unit standpoint
134,and then we can talk about it from how has our business done
135,"From a unit standpoint, the decline has certainly slowed down"
136,"If you go back a year or two ago, we were high single digits to low teens declines at times year over year from a unit basis, and that slowed into the low single digits that we're seeing today, but we still are seeing a decline on a unit level"
137,"And I always remind people, we've taken probably something like 25% of the annual units out of this business, yet grown in that timeframe the profitability of that business significantly"
138,"So, that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant, have really delivered to the company"
139,"So our view is, John, that if you take a long-term view, we see the pattern kind of stabilizing at about where it is"
140,"I think we'll come in here and there will be quarters when the units are up slightly, and there will be other quarters when the units are down a little more slightly"
141,"But when we look at it over the long haul, they're probably going to be down those low single digits"
142,"But we also see segments that are growing, that are very performance focused, which allow us opportunity"
143,"So you talked about them, gaming, 2-in-1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook as we like to think about it from the old, those products are continuing to see growth actually, and they are pushing that record Core i5, Core i7."
144,"They're pushing the desire for Core i9, which is a new product we introduced"
145,"Those are what's driving the segmentation, the ASP uplift, and the increased profitability"
146,We think to some level that trend will continue
147,How long?
148,I'm not going to be that good
149,"a prognosticator, but certainly for the near-term future, we don't see this trend shifting very much"
150,John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
151,LLC
152,"And then, Brian, just on the modem side, your prepared comments, I think you said it was up 37% year over year"
153,What's the sustainability of that business and your ability to continue to grow that business through penetration?
154,I'm excited about the modem business
155,"We, I think, really gotten a team together that is world-class"
156,"We believe we now are on a yearly cadence of world-class modems, which is really critical"
157,That's a big hurdle to get that technology to where you can reliably put out on a yearly cadence a world-class modem
158,We believe we're there now
159,"We continue to increase the profitability or the efficiency of that organization, which we've always talked about in the past, and that's continued"
160,So we think we can continue to both drive the technology and continue to grow that business
161,John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
162,LLC Thank you
163,Sure
164,"I think in our statements and in the release, we showed you that we actually lowered CapEx by about $500 million for this year"
165,We've talked about CapEx and thinking about it as being in this range
166,I don't think we have anything else to say about – it's pretty close right now
167,We're just focused on the execution into Q4 and prepping for our view for 2018.
168,So I don't want to have any other discussion on CapEx until we get to the January timeframe right now for 2018.
169,"Yes, think of it – so first, absolutely you're right that we are going to move much more of our focus towards data center products coming first"
170,"It's not going to be the early part of 10-nanometer, though"
171,You've got to look at the design cycles
172,"And you make a decision like that, even if you make it last year, you'll start to see the effect at the back end of 10-nanometers"
173,and you'll really see it affect
174,"7-nanometers, so"
175,"not these early products on 10-nanometer, though"
176,They were already in the hopper when we made that move
177,"Sure, that's a great question"
178,"So we mentioned that even out of those 14, many of those continue on up into Level 3, Level 4."
179,The Level 5 work that you see
180,out there is pretty far out there
181,And I'd tell you that's there's a lot of just experimental work going on there
182,"If I take a look at the bigger picture, which is what you're asking, this whole picture that we've been putting together is – I said in the statement that individually these businesses are great"
183,"But when you put all these together into one package and you're able to walk into a customer with a complete solution, they're truly world-class and something nobody else can deliver"
184,"So you're right, when we go in"
185,"and we talk to somebody about autonomous driving in general, whether it's Level 2 bots, Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5"
186,", we bring with us a suite of products, depending on what kind of architecture"
187,"And what we're seeing is different OEMs, different customers thinking about those architectures even differently across that spectrum"
188,"Some are thinking but by Level 5, I think my skills will be up"
189,I want a closed system
190,I want to have much more control of the software
191,So we have a set of solutions we bring to them there
192,Some of them want to have more FPGAs for how they bring their software down onto the silicon earlier on
193,But what we're able to do is bring our modems
194,"We shipped, and we mentioned it in the release, our first automotive modem"
195,So we're able to bring automotive modems all the way through 5G
196,"Most of these car companies are having to build data centers, and not just data centers, centralized data centers, but really a data center architecture that goes all the way out with data and compute at the edge"
197,"You're going to want to be able to manipulate and transfer mapping, high-precision mapping, to the cars and data back from the cars to change those maps' construction and things like that"
198,"So we're building that architecture, and we have the products and the talent to uniquely work with them all through that infrastructure"
199,"And then you get out to the car again and we can bring the FPGAs, the Mobileye for sensor fusion or compute"
200,We can put Xeons in there
201,"And each one of these discussions, they're all a bit different"
202,"They all have multiple phases as you go through 3, 4, and 5 on the levels"
203,And what we're able to do is say you don't have to just take this one solution
204,This is not the only solution there is
205,What would you like to do?
206,"What best solves your problem in the most cost-effective, lowest power, efficient way?"
207,How much work do you want us to do in software and development versus how much work do you want to own and have IP within your company?
208,"And that's changing, as we said, over time"
209,And that's part of also why we're building out that 100-car fleet
210,Amnon [Shashua] really has driven a vision that says it's one thing to bring foils to a meeting
211,It's another thing to bring a car and say now let's go out and drive and show you how all of these fit together
212,So all of that is – this package that we have is unique and it's resonating quite well as we walk in to the various car OEMs.
213,"And I'm out there with them in various modes almost every week, every other week"
214,Amnon is out
215,We're all talking about a complete package
