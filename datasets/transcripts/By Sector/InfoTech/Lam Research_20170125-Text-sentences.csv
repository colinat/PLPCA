75,There’ll always be puts and takes around it as you’ve seen over the last couple of years
76,"Thanks, Tim"
77,"I’m not going to give you a dollar number, C"
78,", but I’ll remind you, the way to think about it is when you’ve got an accelerating shipment profile like we’ve"
79,had you always get revenue lags as it just takes time to get things into the fab and they accepted
80,And when you’re seeing a guide in March where revenue again is lagging shipments and so I accept deferred revenue will build in March
81,"What happens when shipments level off or if they in one quarter might go down a little bit, then revenue will catch up"
82,Over time it all normalizes and it’s going to be the same numbers

93,"We haven’t had any definitive conversation, because just too early right now and too much uncertainty"
94,"But stay tuned, we’re paying very close attention to it"
95,"Farhan, you heard Martin described kind of more first half weighted overall both WFE and shipments, and also describe NAND is maybe more first half weighted than the other stuff, so that’s a data point for you"

108,It’s still roughly a quarter of the company’s overall business

113,"Thanks, Chris"
114,"That’s probably a reasonable assumption, Toshiya, yeah, it’s - that’s not unreasonable"
115,"I am not going to give you specificity is just investments we were making with an eye towards of penetration,"
116,two nodes from now that didn’t end up come into fruition

119,It’s always been quite profitable
120,"It’s a great business, right?"
121,All the investment occurs in new equipment
122,It gets leveraged in installed base
123,It doesn’t require a whole lot of investment
124,It’s just - it’s a very profitable part of the business
