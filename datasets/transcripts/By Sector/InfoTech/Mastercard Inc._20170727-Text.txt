Good morning, everybody
So we continue to execute well against our strategy
You can see that in our strong second quarter financial and operational performance
We're really pleased
We're delivering net revenue growth of 14% and if you exclude a special item related to a legal provision that we took last year in the same quarter, EPS growth is 16%, both of these numbers on a currency-neutral basis
In terms of the global economic environment, not much has changed since the last quarter
economy just continues its steady growth trajectory; low unemployment, low inflation, healthy consumer confidence, and if you look at our SpendingPulse data, retail sales ex auto were up 3.6%, that's kind of similar to last quarter
In Europe, real GDV is expected to grow by about 2% this year, in 2017. Consumer confidence is continuing to improve and that's primarily driven by Germany and Spain
But, of course, unemployment does remain relatively high in some of the EU countries
Now in the UK, interestingly, despite ongoing concerns around Brexit, SpendingPulse showed solid overall retail sales growth of 5% in the quarter and that's partly driven by higher consumer spending due to rising inflation, the lower pound basically
In Asia, we continue to see strong economic growth in India and several of the ASEAN countries
In Latin America, despite all the recent political turmoil and sustained high unemployment, Brazil is showing both consumer and business confidence improving
Economic growth in Mexico has been solid, driven by consumer spending
Venezuela, of course, continues to deteriorate, triple digit inflation, high foreign exchange volatility
With this backdrop, we're kind of pleased with the growth we're seeing across our business
We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets
We're continuing to win deals by differentiating with services and, of course, by leveraging the work we're doing in digital
In terms of key business updates, as you know, we recently closed the VocaLink acquisition
We're just pleased that we now have the ability to offer both card and bank account-based payment solutions to our customers
If you look at the payment flows in the top 50 countries around the world, a significant portion of the payments are being made via ACH
With Fast ACH, in particular, we have the ability to now enable payments to and from any bank account in real time
And that expands our reach to more end points, including businesses, governments and consumers, who may only have a bank account and not a card
And as you can imagine, for consumers, that's not that infrequent in many markets around the world
Further, VocaLink's Fast ACH is well suited for certain use cases and why is that? That's because of its enhanced data and messaging capabilities
So, for instance, it can connect to ERP systems to facilitate B2B payables and receivable management, but it can also support bill pay through its Request to Pay messaging capability
As of now, over 25 countries are actively pursuing Fast ACH networks, a number of which have already launched
VocaLink currently provides those capabilities to the UK, Sweden, Singapore, Thailand and, of course, in the United States, with the clearinghouse, and it's also engaged in many other such opportunities
Now, VocaLink and Fast ACH complement our Mastercard Send push payment service
What that does is it facilitates the delivery of funds in near real-time, not real-time, to virtually all debit card accounts in the United States
In addition, by leveraging the exclusive capabilities from what we have with our HomeSend JV, we can enable cross-border payments to over 85 markets, now by connecting into cash in and cash-out locations, by connecting into mobile wallets and bank accounts
So what we have now is a unique combination of product offerings that we believe will allow us to better facilitate consumer choice
And through that process, capture an even greater set of new payment flows
What we will have is card rails, which we've had for years
We have Mastercard Send and now, Fast ACH rails
With this, Mastercard can become a one-stop shop for our customers, banks, merchants and governments
We're looking forward to talking to you more about our strategy around Fast ACH and our other network capabilities during our upcoming Investor Day
Now in the safety and security space, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Brighterion, whose artificial intelligence based technology enables more accurate decision-making and fraud scoring at the time of the transaction, obviously to mitigate risk and also reduce false declines
Now adding that capability expands our advanced suite of security products and expertise in fraud migration, in authentication and decision intelligence, while trying to make sure that the consumer has a seamless payment experience
So, with that, I'm going to move on to some of our recent deal activity
, we continue to have success in the co-brand space
This quarter, we're pleased to announce Kroger, the largest grocery chain in the world, will be converting their credit portfolio with U.S
Bank to Mastercard
Still with U.S
Bank, that's our partner in this co-brand
In addition, we won a new co-brand program with Belk, a department store chain with about 300 locations throughout the United States and renewed our credit co-brand agreement with Toys "R" Us
We also renewed Saturn (8:20) there in the U.S
for their credit and debit business, which includes our Decision Intelligence, fraud solutions and gateway processing services
In each of these deals, our innovative solutions and value-added services were key differentiators for us
Building on the agreement we announced in the U.S
last year, we're pleased to extend our partnership with PayPal into Asia-Pacific, which brings similar features and benefits to this region
In fact, we've just announced and signed that in the last 24 hours
We've been working with PayPal around the world for a long time, as most of their co-brand cards globally are Mastercard-branded
And just for an example, in Europe, we have multiple co-brands with them, including a prepaid program in Italy, commercial debit in the UK and, by the way, they've also been a licensed issuer in the region since 2011. Now talking about Europe, we continue to drive strong performance and win new deals there
I'm going to give you a couple of examples
We have renewed and expanded our agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo in Italy, which is one of the largest banks in the country for their credit, debit and prepaid business and that includes advisor services
We're also pleased with some recent progress in the UK debit space
This quarter, we announced a deal with TSB to flip their entire debit portfolio to Mastercard, building on our existing relationship with them in credit
Now, this is a significant win for us because TSB's customers represent over 4% of all debit customers in the United Kingdom
The partnership also includes their commercial business and we'll leverage our expertise in digital, in fraud, data analytics and even our Priceless sponsorship assets to deliver an even better payment experience for TSB's customers
China, as you know, we've been deeply engaged in navigating the potential opening of their domestic payments market
Back in March of this year, we actually submitted a draft application for a domestic bank card clearing institution
That early draft was informed by active considerations and conversations with the People's Bank of China and actually a number of potential partners as well in the market over the last two years
Now, more recent set of regulations got published, as you know, on June 30, so we're now finalizing our next application based on that new set of regulations
We're working through all our options for either a 100% Mastercard application or for a joint venture
We're going to make a decision on this and then file our next application
Obviously, what's really important here is to get it right out of the gate
Because, remember, this is just another step in the process that will likely play out over the next 12 to 18 months as there are several review cycles from the Chinese regulators between now and that point of time
At the same time, we've also been working on developing our technology network solution for China, which considers both national and cyber security standards and we're progressing well in that regard
Now, in the meanwhile, what we are doing is continuing to make progress with single-branded cards and we've nearly quadrupled year-over-year single-brand card issuance, launched a total of 18 new programs in the first half of this year, including the first single-branded EMV Debit card in China with Bank of China, and a World card with ICBC, which is targeted at their affluent customer base
So, finally, we're continuing to see growth in our commercial business, and is driven by a combination of innovation and some new deals
On the product front, we just recently announced the launch of the Mastercard B2B Hub, which is an innovative solution that enables small and medium-size businesses in the United States to automate their invoice and payment processes
As you know, more than 50% of all B2B payments in the U.S
are still made via checks and if we can integrate this with more than our 130 accounting and back-office systems and also into inControl, our virtual card platform, now we believe this solution helps buyers and suppliers reduce the burden and the cost associated with manual payment processes and helps us to accelerate the conversion from check to electronic payment
The idea clearly is to capture new payment flows
And in terms of new commercial payment deals in this space, we are pleased to have renewed and expanded our agreement with Citibank in the UAE for their commercial business
I think that win was basically driven by our virtual card platform as well as our ability to help drive B2B acceptance in the market
We're also expanding our global partnership with Amadeus, which I spoke about last quarter, to the United States, with U.S
Bank as their exclusive issuer, as we continue to pursue the more than $300 billion in annual global payments that travel agencies make to airlines, hotels, and other travel providers, which by the way today are largely made via bank transfers and checks
So turning to digital, we're making good progress with the execution of our Digital by Default strategy with issuers
We now have over 90 million enabled accounts and we're actually pleased to have partnered on the launch last week of Citi Pay in the U.S
, which is powered by Masterpass
This wallet enables customers and consumers of Citibank to use their Citibank online login credentials to make seamless payments across all channels; online, in-app, in-store with their card number, which is protected through our MDES organization service
We've also added U.S
Bank and SunTrust in the U.S
We've also added Davivienda in Columbia
That's the progress we are making
We are continuing our momentum on the digital acceptance side
We now have more than 340,000 online merchants across 38 markets in addition to the 6 million contactless locations in 96 countries, where Masterpass can be used
This quarter, we're really pleased to have added Ann Taylor, LOFT, Hulu, Air Canada, Costco Canada
We've integrated Vodafone in Turkey, which is the second largest mobile network operator in that market to enable their more than 22 million subscribers to pay for mobile airtime minutes and other services using Masterpass
And, finally, a good example of our thought leadership in driving the convergence from physical to digital can be seen in our partnership with EMVCo and other industry participants to enable greater choice in retail payments by creating a new global standard to ensure consistency, industry consistency in QR codes
And this builds on our momentum with the rollout of QR technology in Africa and India
In addition to the launch of BharatQR in India, which is now live with four large banks in the country, we've partnered with the Bank of Thailand and the Government of Thailand in support of their goal of creating a cashless society
So, with that, I'm going to turn the call back to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics
So, I think that Mastercard Send is similar in a way to other offerings in the marketplace
We could have taken that, combined it with our HomeSend JV, extended its reach to mobile wallets and cash-in and cash-out points around the world
That's one way to have built it
There would be some challenges still left with that to really enable that to compete the way Fast ACH is growing around the world
Those challenges are actually quite interesting and require a real solution to solve for
I'm not saying you can't solve for it organically and try and build it
I just think that's more expensive and a longer solution with less credibility of working than if you pick up a unit like VocaLink with its enormous reputation in the UK where it operates the payments infrastructure, but also its ability in multiple countries around the world
ACH has been a country-by-country business
VocaLink is one of the only players in the world that has demonstrated the ability to take its software and apply it in markets as diverse as Sweden and the UK and the United States and Singapore and Thailand and so on
That's the first point
I think the second point is the nature of the data flows; now this is a little bit more in the commercial B2B payment space, the nature of the data flows that come back-and-forth over VocaLink's B2B payment enabled system is such that you get their ISO 20022 dealer standard
So what they get is far more information that allows them to integrate seamlessly with B2B ERP systems, with e-commerce systems and cross-border payments are also built in there, as standard
They have directories which combines the VocaLink IPS system with these directories, simplifies the flow of payments, simplifies payment requests
So, the aspects in the B2B space that I think with the richer data set and the better connectivity of VocaLink Fast ACH that I think are actually quite important to be able to play a good role in that space
So the combination of these two is kind of what prompted us sometime back doing a scan across the world of the opportunity to enter Fast ACH
We kind of took the decision that if this property were not available, we probably would have tried to build something organically with its opportunities and risks and costs and timeframe
But as it so turned out, the opportunity with VocaLink came along and we were trying our best to leap on it and take it and move forward
That's broadly what we're trying to do
Well, I'll tell you this much, that what we are looking at is the fact that all the new regulations that went in, the one part of them were the routing regulations; another part was the actual, as you know, a level of interchange
There were other parts of our co-branding and co-badging and separational switch and scheme
There were a series of these that went in
I will tell you this
The expansion of acceptance that is going on for brands like us across Europe is actually for the first time encouraging
As you can see, even in Germany, where Martina hails from, even in Germany, and I'm not holding it against her, but that's where she hails from
Even the Germans are beginning to use these payment systems in these stores which earlier they did not
They basically paid through the giro through their bank accounts
You can see a change coming from the merchant community as well as the consumers, which I think is a function not just of one aspect of the regulation, but of the totality, which I think is what the EC (30:06) wanted to do
They wanted to create fresh momentum and fresh competition in the market, both for us and against what we do, and I think that's fine
That's a competitive marketplace
Sanjay, not yet directly
Although, as I said, they are winning some deals and that's because the market is a little more open to now having these conversations as compared to prior to the acquisition when everybody was waiting for that to happen with all their obvious benefits that were tied up in that
But I would say – you remember even that Visa is still sorting through it, as they themselves said, all their agreements with their customers
So, you've got to let this play out for a little while
But, we are seeing progress, we are winning deals, and I'm just giving you a couple of examples, I'm trying not to give you a list
But, we are winning deals along the way
This will become, as I said over time, you should get past this couple of years and then think about this as settling into a regular competitive marketplace, where one of two or three things will happen
Either the yields of that market, which tend to be lower than global yields, will begin to come up a little bit, maybe, maybe not; we'll see
Or, the opportunity to win more deals and volume will present itself
One of those two will fall into place
Right now, it feels more of the latter than the former
But, it's early days
That's why to that earlier question I'm so delighted about the expansion and acceptance, even in Germany
First of all, the last part, to me Masterpass and bank wallets are one and the same thing
I'm not into building Masterpass as I've said as a B2C solution
it's really a B2B2C solution
Banks can take a wallet container from us or build their own and then ride our rails, which is what a number of them are doing
Someone like CitiPay uses Masterpass more extensively than others
I'm fine with that
That to me is our model
It's a open, engagement model with banks and others who are authorized to have financial accounts so that we can enable the path through digitization as compared to trying to build our own wallet
That's not what I'm trying to do
The standards topic is a really interesting one
To me, if you're going to make progress in expanding acceptance and QR code is a little bit of our expanding acceptance into markets where infrastructure and the cost of having terminals as well as the running costs of managing those terminals, are challenging
So you take in Africa, you take parts of India or you take Pakistan or other such markets, or even parts of China, at the end of the day, QR codes represent a real opportunity to enable electronic payments in smaller and more remote shops
What essentially you are doing, you can pull or you can push the payment, meaning you can have a QR code that is unique to the merchant, in which case a consumer who walks in using a phone with a camera can actually focus on that QR code and enable the money to be transferred to that merchant for the potatoes and onions and bicycle tires they bought
Or, it could be the other way around, where the consumer carries around a QR code, which is unique to them, and it can connect into the merchants system to enable the money to be sent from the consumers account to the merchants account
Both are possible, both are feasible, both have been tried in different markets in the world
The idea of standardizing them across EMVCo is to ensure that banks and merchants don't end up with complicated multiple standards between us and the other participants in EMVCo, which include Visa and AMEX and the others
So that's the purpose of what we're trying to get done
We've actually done that and issued standardized guidelines so that the acquirers and the merchants and the banks can find a simpler way to connect to what I think could be a transformative way of growing acceptance in a number of these markets
I'm glad you called them prepared remarks
There are days when Warren and Martina are worried about what I might say compared to the prepared remarks
But I will note that for my future
So, Kroger
Kroger was a co-brand that many years ago actually used to be with Mastercard
I think it flipped out of Mastercard either the year before I joined, or two years; I actually don't remember correctly
But, I know about 8, 9,10 years ago it moved away, and it was with our competitor, largest competitor, with Visa
Bank is their issuer and their primary banking relationship
Kroger went through a relatively detailed process of figuring out how to renew and what to renew
And we all went through and made our usual pitches for it and it ended up with U.S
Bank and us as being the partners for their co-brand platform going forward
We haven't yet finalized the dates of the migration of the portfolio
That work is happening as we scope out the different aspects of this
Over the next few months, I'm pretty certain we will be able to give you a better date and a better guideline
And Martina will be able to help you with that
First of all, you're correct
We are lapping some of those losses and there is an improvement in both our consumer and commercial credit in the U.S
You've got to remember, we've got a good presence in commercial credit as well
And we look at both as part of our credit business in the United States
In consumer, which is I think where your question was coming from compared to the commercial side, in consumer, within the market, as I said, are looking for opportunities to grow
Those opportunities have, over the last few years, largely been through merchant driven co-brand decisions and we win some and we don't win some
This quarter, we've got a couple we told you about that we won
There are a couple of others that we won that we won't announce for another year or so till the deals become visible in the marketplace
But there are others we didn't win
We didn't win Costco in the United States some quarters ago
So we won Costco in Canada, but we didn't win it in the U.S
We have a relationship with Costco in other markets around the world
And so there are deals we'll win and there are deals we'll not win
We will try and do them in a way that makes economic sense to our bottom line
That's the principle behind those deals
It's the same for winning more credit share with issuers and for looking at them as part of participating in their growth
One of our biggest partners, as you know, is Citibank
And you know that Citibank has begun to reinvest very wisely in their credit business over the last few quarters
And, honestly, their own performance, as a result, is improving
And their performance, which is improving, is driving our improvement, because they're one of our best partners
And that's kind of how this works for us and we try to work our way through this in a sensible way and support our principal customers and work with them on growth, while we try and win as many deals as we can, when and if they come up in the marketplace
Hi, Tien-Tsin
Yeah, well, the TSB conversation honestly had started before the Visa European transition
I remember talking to them some time ago
It so happened that the Visa Europe transition happened in between
But is there pipeline in the marketplace from large, medium and small sized banks that we are pursuing? Absolutely
But I'm not going to say much more about it
It's a good case study
Craig, it's very tiny yet and you're correct that it's early days
It's a couple of banks and I'm actually looking at Martina to try to figure out whether it's two or three banks
Yeah
So, right now, it's very early
But I'll tell you a different picture about it which I think you'll be more interested in
My view is that a consumer must get choice at the front end of their decision of how to pay and that choice should be connected back to where their bank relationship comes from
And if that choice is to pay by direct debit to their bank account or by the inward receipt of a remittance through a friend, a relative or a government disbursement or with a debit card or a prepaid card or a credit card, that concept of choice is what we're trying to put together when I was describing the opportunity with Fast ACH as well as what we have, which is Mastercard Send and HomeSend and our card rails
Whether you – pay by bank has only one way of choosing right now, which is from your bank account
I visualize that as being important and an interesting application not just in the UK but in other markets as well
It can lead to some good volume growth, but what I also visualize over time is the choice coming across to a consumer at the point-of-sale on their phone or from the terminal, whichever way, a choice to make payments from these alternative funding sources
That's what I think is where all this is going
I continue to believe that the opportunity in B2B for ACH and therefore VocaLink type of Fast ACH payments is enormous
It's way beyond what a Mastercard Send or card rails can address
Why is that? Card rails requires you to have card acceptance with all these merchants on both side or the businesses on both sides of a B2B transaction
And while you can attempt to build that acceptance and we have built it over the years, we're actually building in a number of markets around the world
But I would say while that addresses a portion of the opportunity, there is a much bigger opportunity that lies outside of that portion
That outside of that portion opportunity you can address a part of it through the tools of a Mastercard Send combined with a HomeSend because you've got multiple distribution points you could reach
But even now you don't have the right data and connectivity to the ERP systems of these B2B businesses that you can get with an ISO 20022 certified data standard system like VocaLink
That's the real difference
So think of this as layering a cake
There is what you can do with the card
We're going to do it
There is what you can do by adding HomeSend
We're going to do it
There's a little more I can do than most other people there by adding on the HomeSend capability
But, boy, what I really love is the capability with Fast ACH
So I'll give you a number for the United Kingdom
In the UK alone, VocaLink's domestic real-time platform carries over last year about 1.4 billion transactions per annum and the combined value of that is $1.5 trillion
Whatever you can look at addressing through card rails and through the equivalent of Mastercard Send rails would be a fraction of that number
Now, to be clear, the revenue dynamics and the challenges of building that's out, I'm not discounting any of those
Please don't assume that by next quarter I'm going to have the worlds answer to B2B payments
I'm going to build it, but what I've got now is the right set of tools between card rails, Send, HomeSend and Fast ACH and as we get together and roll these out sensibly, in sensible profitable ways across the world, you should see us bringing choice and data capability through this to the front end of a B2B business
Just keep this in mind, it's about choice, both commercial enterprises as well as for consumers and all I'm trying to do is to have the repertoire that allows us to do that in a sensible, practical way
Next question, please?
So, Martina, didn't send you an email on the side asking you to ask me an India question because of my poking her on Germany, right? I'm just guessing
But the India opportunity, so there are close to 850 million debit cards in that market
A large number of them, by the way, are still used essentially for taking cash out from an ATM
It's only a smaller number of them that are used at the point-of-sale and credit cards are way smaller than the debit cards, we're talking about a fraction of those
Those, of course, used at point-of-sale
There's little cash take out on those, although there is some
And when you put that together, you get a market that has lots of cards, more than they ever had, but still with a huge opportunity in the front of it
The second side of it is the acceptance methodology
Whether it's card payment or pay by a QR code or pay by a phone or a fingerprint and all those options are being developed by different players in India, including us
I think what you'll find is that this is only as good as how the acceptance market in India evolves
Now, the acceptance market is growing rapidly in the sense that over the course of this last eight, nine months, you've had a 70%, 80% growth in merchants
But it comes to 2.5 million, 2.6 million merchants, depending on who you're counting
If you look at the total number of merchants in India, the Confederation of All India Traders with whom we have a very deep partnership, estimates there are 60 million merchants
Now, a large number of those are going to be fruit sellers and casual merchants who I don't yet know how we will get to create electronification, although we probably could over time
But there's still a large number there that should get into acceptance expansion
Now, the acquiring community in India is actually pretty good at growing the acceptance
Their challenge has been in the past the risk underwriting capability compared to their business model because all the acquirers in India are actually issuing banks as well and their business model is not clear until the revenue dynamics of their business model is clarified by the Reserve Bank of India
For the last few months now, since the demonetization, there has been a dispute going on about the level of MDR that the banks will make out of the system
If you don't clarify that, you're going to find a lack of appetite on the part of the players there to grow acceptance
It's got nothing to do with Visa and Mastercard going into the market acquiring or not
We ourselves won't know what our revenue model will be or what our profitability model will be till we get clarity on the pricing model in the marketplace
That pricing model was supposed to have been clarified a couple of months back
I think there have been recommendations made by the Reserve Bank of India to the Indian government
We're still waiting for them to finalize that
I am hopeful they will finalize that
I raised that recently in a public meeting with the Prime Minister as well
I know they're working through a number of puts and takes to figure it out
Once they do, I think back to the earlier question Lisa asked me about QR codes, I think you will see between traditional terminals, mobile as a point-of-sale and QR codes with dongles, I mean, mobile is a point-of-sale in dongles, and QR codes, I think you will see a reasonably strong expansion of acceptance in India
And people like us and our competitors, we can focus on enabling banks and merchants to make sense out of this opportunity
Remember, there's one big impetus coming, which is the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax called GST in India
That GST has levels and slabs, but most commodities are at 28%
People will be paying that 28% when they receive goods in a merchant shop
A merchant is no longer incented to help a consumer not pay taxes because they are most likely to have paid a relatively high tax rate on receiving those goods from their supplier
And therefore subsidizing that to a consumer by helping to avoid taxes is probably something that we should see reducing over the next few years
And that, to me, is the real change in the (59:02) in this place
So if we can get our stuff together in the MDR, get the acceptance expansion going, build the right digital tools and QR tools, and roll those out, while also not losing focus on cards, I think there is a really interesting opportunity over the next five to seven years in India
So thank you for all your questions
And I'm going to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts
We've had a strong first half of the year
We're just really pleased to have delivered record revenue and earnings per share in this quarter
I believe we are executing well against our strategy
We've added a number of new capabilities, which we were talking about during the Q&A, which I think differentiate us from competition and they add real value to our merchant and bank customers
With Fast ACH, we now have the ability to offer even greater choice for our customers with both cards and bank account based payment solutions
With the Mastercard B2B Hub, we think we're continuing to deliver innovative solutions to help companies manage their businesses more efficiently
And with Brighterion, another company we acquired this quarter, we're extending our capabilities in artificial intelligence to create an even better and safer payment experience for consumers
So I'm looking forward to having a number of you join us at our upcoming Investor Day in New York
You'll have an opportunity to hear about our strategic areas of focus, and you can get a chance to touch and feel and experience the various ways that we are working to capture new payment flows and help to shape the future of where payments are going
Thank you for your support, and thank you for joining us today
