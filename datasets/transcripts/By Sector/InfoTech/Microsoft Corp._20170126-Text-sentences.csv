90,Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments
91,"In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion"
92,"This reflects the continued annuity shift to the cloud with Office 365, Dynamics double-digit billings growth, and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting"
93,"In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services"

99,"In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2."
100,"As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we've passed the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo!"
101,deal and the associated change in revenue recognition
102,"And in Gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing balanced by higher engagement, usage, and transaction volume"
103,"In Devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone"
104,Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book
105,"We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses"
106,LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets
107,"We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn"
108,The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets
109,"For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn"
110,The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets
111,Other income and expense should be $150 million
112,"We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests"
113,"Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our BUILD Developer Conference in May here in Seattle"
114,We will share more details as we get closer to the date
115,"Chris, let's move to Q&A"
116,"Yeah, I think Satya is correct"
117,"The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on – excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses"
118,"As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue"
119,"So the in-quarter revenue and the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses, which will also hit"
120,We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves
121,"And I think, Brent, in terms of there being a date, a very particular date, this is something, to Satya's point, we've been doing in a step function improvement over time for the past couple years, and we'll continue to do it"
122,And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business
123,"In fact, in some ways, it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas"
124,So I think that's how I tend to look at it
125,"Thanks, Heather"
126,"Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer"
127,"You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 365, as well as our Azure core and premium services"
128,"And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud"
129,"It benefits margin, not just in Azure but across actually the entirety of the cloud"
130,"That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected"
131,But I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety
132,"But I do respect people always wonder, so"
133,I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure specifically
134,I am sticking with it being about a point
135,That's the guidance we gave
136,"And even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it's about a point"
137,"So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it"
138,"Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business"
139,And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows
140,That tends to have a very good margin profile
141,"And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve"
142,"And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile"
143,"So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year"
144,"But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps"
145,Thanks
146,"Thanks, Mark"
147,Let me start by saying it's why we tend to focus all up at that server products and services
148,KPI being double digits generally an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the on-prem business
149,"But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter, and then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward"
150,"We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year"
151,That value prop is resonating
152,We saw some growth
153,I feel very good about that
154,And so I do think that can have an impact in H2.
155,You heard me talk a little bit about it
156,"With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us"
157,It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2.
158,"And so it will be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide"
159,But I would reiterate the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw
160,"Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn"
161,So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth
162,But the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition and IC
163,"The way I think about it, we really – Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago – it's been a little longer than that now, to over-index on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud"
164,We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition cost
165,We invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities and our sales force
166,We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers
167,That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number
168,"And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts"
169,"A lot of that account value frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue"
170,Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be
171,And so some of the confidence
172,I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have
173,And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making
174,It's starting to pivot to consumed
175,It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet
176,But I think you're right
177,We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient
178,"People often think we focus on cut here, add here"
179,"It's also about, are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful?"
180,"And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, whether it's how we build products"
181,And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land
182,"And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors"
183,But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate
184,And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core
185,"And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications"
186,"And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution"
187,The margins weren't as high either
188,And so I do think it will be a blend of those
189,"But certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from"
190,"And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3."
191,Transitions take time
192,And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5.
193,"We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice"
194,"But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3."
195,And so then that leads to your question on
196,do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads
197,"And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace"
198,Sure
199,Let me first comment on that
200,I've said it will be lower than it was previously
201,"I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer"
202,I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful
203,"I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter, and it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn"
204,Our real goal for LinkedIn is – over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets
205,"But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members"
206,And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure
207,"So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy"
