98,"Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events, our Education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3, and the upcoming keynote from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY 2018."
99,We will also host our financial analyst briefing on May 10.
100,The webcast will be available our Investor Relations website
101,"Chris, let's move to Q&A"
102,"And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment"
103,"The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not"
104,"And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer"
105,", I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth"
106,"And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction"
107,"And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out"
108,"It tends to be – in this instance, Japan was a little better"
109,It can be product-launch related
110,It can be macro-impacted
111,"But whether or not you see that in transactional, the Uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamic Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about, whether it's a quote-unquote, on-prem server launch or an Azure feature, about the integration of the two"
112,"And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018."
113,"And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance"
114,"versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us"
115,"The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter"
116,"In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature"
117,Japan happens to be one of those geos
118,"And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent"
119,"So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark"
120,"On ASC 606, we will talk about it in detail actually on May 10 in terms of the timing and what you can expect"
121,"You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example"
122,The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM
123,Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile
124,"But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change in some ways back to how we thought about OEM revenue"
125,So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.
126,I answered them in the opposite order
127,"And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value"
128,"This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU."
129,"And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs"
130,And so what you'll continue to see
131,is that would normalize
132,Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well
133,", I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself"
134,"Great, let me take both of those"
135,"Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking two that I probably don't relate as directly, and I should do that for you"
136,"We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out"
137,"And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us"
138,"Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return, as you know, I think we've been and executed a significant capital return program over the past couple years, including accelerating the buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created"
139,And so I wouldn't say that I view those two things as waiting for one to do the other
140,"We've in fact continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends, as well as repurchase shares"
141,And we've continued to do that this quarter as well
142,"I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related"
143,"The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new"
144,"And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS"
145,"At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them"
146,"So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities"
147,"We learn, frankly, I think every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate"
148,"That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint"
149,"More I view, is the return healthy?"
150,Is it growing the top line?
151,Are we executing well on it?
152,"And if we are, it will make sense to spend more and if we aren't, it won't"
153,And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number
154,I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments
155,And are they earning the right return?
156,Are we doing them in the right way?
157,Are they in the might market?
158,"Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities?"
159,"What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on"
160,And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers
161,"And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year"
162,"And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10."
163,And I think your question about is it really budgets
164,", I think you used the phrase opening up"
165,"What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do"
166,"Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen"
167,"For me, what I think is missing in that question is really – it's not about any one customer saying"
168,"wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more"
169,"These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself"
170,"And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently"
171,"And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly"
172,"This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology"
173,"Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better"
174,"That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement"
175,"Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really"
176,The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change
177,"And so while year over year you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly"
178,", you've seen over the past six quarters, even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying and underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more"
179,Thanks
180,"In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track"
181,"And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3."
182,I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect
183,"And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out"
184,"And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition"
185,"So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3."
186,"And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving"
187,We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature
188,I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow
