Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone
Our third quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, up 6% and 7% in constant currency; gross margin grew 7% and 9% in constant currency; operating income grew 2% or 5% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $0.73, an increase of 16% and 19% in constant currency
This was the first full quarter of company results of LinkedIn, which had a significant impact on revenue, gross margin, and operating income
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth, which includes $371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles
From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends
Our performance in Japan was better than expected, driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions
Our commercial annuity mix was 88%, even with another quarter of higher than expected transactional revenue results
Commercial bookings increased 12% or 11% in constant currency
Commercial unearned revenue followed historical seasonal trends, coming in at $20.4 billion and growing 9% and 10% in constant currency
And our contracted-not-billed balance increased to more than $27.5 billion
Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52%
Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased to 51%, up 6 points from last year, with improvement across Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics
And gross margin dollars grew 74%, keeping us on pace for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year
As a reminder, our commercial cloud includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, but does not include LinkedIn
Our company gross margin was 66%, better than anticipated and up 1 point, as the sales mix of higher-margin product and services coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement more than offset the impact of $218 million of LinkedIn amortization
Now to FX
This quarter, the U.S
dollar was weaker than expected
As such, we had 1 point less FX impact across our individual reporting segments, even though overall company impact was still approximately 1 point as guided
FX impacted the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments by 1 point and had minimal impact in More Personal Computing
Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense
Now, let's move to the segment results
Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 22% and 23% in constant currency to $8 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth
Office commercial revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency
Office 365 commercial revenue increased 45%, driven by installed base growth across all workloads and continued ARPU expansion
Our transactional results came in higher than expected, mostly from performance in large markets like Japan and Western Europe
Office consumer revenue increased 15% and 14% in constant currency, primarily from recurring subscription revenue as well as growth in our subscriber base
Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with Dynamics 365 customer momentum contributing to double-digit billings growth
LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was $975 million
Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles
Gross margin percentage declined due to a higher mix of cloud revenue and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization
Operating expenses increased 44% and 45% in constant currency, with 43 points from LinkedIn, including $153 million of amortization expense
Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency, with 13 points of impact from LinkedIn
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency
Server products and cloud services revenue increased 15%, up 16% in constant currency, demonstrating durable double-digit growth
Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency, and annuity revenue again grew double digits
Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using our premium services
Our Windows Server and SQL Server transactional business continued to perform well; with better than expected results mainly from Japan and continuing post-launch demand
As expected, Enterprise Services revenue declined 1% and was flat in constant currency due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements
Segment gross margin dollars grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins
We grew operating expenses by 11%, with ongoing investment in sales capacity, cloud engineering, and developer engagement
Operating income was flat and up 3% in constant currency
Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $8.8 billion, declining 7%, as Phone and Surface results offset healthy growth in Windows, search, and gaming
Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter
OEM Pro revenue grew 10%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs
Additionally, the commercial PC market was slightly below our expectations, negatively impacted by channel production timing changes and upcoming Windows SKU pricing changes
Commercial end customer demand signals remain consistent and positive
OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows Premium device category
Overall, inventory levels remain in the normal range
Windows Commercial products and services grew 6%, with healthy enterprise demand as customers continued to deploy Windows 10 for its advanced security and management capabilities
Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit
Search revenue ex-TAC grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume
Devices revenue declined 51%
We had no material Phone revenue this quarter
Our Surface business declined 26% and 25% in constant currency, as heightened price competition and product end-of-lifecycle dynamics resulted in lower than expected Surface Pro unit volumes
Our gaming business grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, as Xbox Live revenue growth offset declines in hardware
Xbox Live monthly active users grew 13% across Xbox One, Windows 10, and mobile platforms, which contributed to software and services revenue growth of 7% and 8% in constant currency
Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency
Gross margin percentage increased with the sales shift to higher-margin products and services
Operating expenses declined 11% and 10% in constant currency from lower Phone expense and Surface launch-related marketing spend in the prior year
Operating income grew 20% in 23% in constant currency
Now back to overall company results, we invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, less than we expected, as a portion of the expense will move into Q4. Other income and expense was $322 million, greater than originally planned, as we saw more opportunities in the equity market to realize gains during the quarter
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23%
We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation through share repurchase and dividends
After a period of accelerated buyback, we've resumed a buyback pace consistent with our historical trends
Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX
Given current rates, we now expect less FX headwinds in our fourth quarter
We expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue
Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing
Second, our commercial business, the fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of Commercial Cloud services
We expect unearned revenue between $26.8 billion and $27 billion, in line with historical seasonality
Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted-not-billed balance and commercial bookings growth
Third, capital expenditure, we expect CapEx to grow sequentially and year over year
Quarterly spend variability will continue, and we remain on track for our full-year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow
Let's move to the individual segments
In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and Commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior-year comparables
We expect consistent growth from Dynamics and approximately $1.05 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting
Similar to Q3, we anticipate that LinkedIn, excluding amortization, will have minimal impact on segment operating income, and we continue to expect it to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this fiscal year
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion in revenue
Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services
Enterprise Services should decline with lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion
In our OEM business, we anticipate that revenue growth will be more aligned with the overall PC market
OEM Pro growth will continue to be driven by Windows 10 Enterprise momentum and aligned to a commercial PC market that should return to typical seasonality
Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, with continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices
In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q3. In gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3 in June, where we will share more on Project Scorpio and new titles for next fiscal year
And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from Phone
With Surface, we expect a more moderate rate of decline given the prior-year comparable and current market dynamics
We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion
This includes approximately $420 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization
We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with roughly $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which $150 million is related to amortization
We now expect full-year operating expenses between $32.9 billion and $33 billion, with approximately $2.3 billion from LinkedIn
That includes about $360 million of amortization expense
Other income and expense should be about $150 million
And for tax, we expect the full fiscal year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% plus or minus 1 point
Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events, our Education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3, and the upcoming keynote from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY 2018. We will also host our financial analyst briefing on May 10. The webcast will be available our Investor Relations website
Chris, let's move to Q&A
And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment
The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not
And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth
And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction
And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out
It tends to be – in this instance, Japan was a little better
It can be product-launch related
It can be macro-impacted
But whether or not you see that in transactional, the Uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamic Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about, whether it's a quote-unquote, on-prem server launch or an Azure feature, about the integration of the two
And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018.
And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us
The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter
In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature
Japan happens to be one of those geos
And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent
So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark
On ASC 606, we will talk about it in detail actually on May 10 in terms of the timing and what you can expect
You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example
The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM
Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile
But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change in some ways back to how we thought about OEM revenue
So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.
I answered them in the opposite order
And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value
This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs
And so what you'll continue to see is that would normalize
Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself
Great, let me take both of those
Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking two that I probably don't relate as directly, and I should do that for you
We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out
And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us
Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return, as you know, I think we've been and executed a significant capital return program over the past couple years, including accelerating the buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created
And so I wouldn't say that I view those two things as waiting for one to do the other
We've in fact continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends, as well as repurchase shares
And we've continued to do that this quarter as well
I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related
The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new
And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS
At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them
So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities
We learn, frankly, I think every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate
That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint
More I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more and if we aren't, it won't
And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number
I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments
And are they earning the right return? Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the might market? Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities? What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on
And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers
And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year
And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.
And I think your question about is it really budgets, I think you used the phrase opening up
What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do
Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen
For me, what I think is missing in that question is really – it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more
These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself
And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently
And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly
This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology
Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better
That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement
Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really
The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change
And so while year over year you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past six quarters, even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying and underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more
Thanks
In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track
And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3. I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect
And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out
And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition
So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving
We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature
I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow
