Q1 results include revenue of $1.3 billion, up 7% from last year
Excluding Airwave, revenue grew 3%
GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year-ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase
Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year
Product backlog is up $285 million
Services backlog is down $156 million driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted
Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year
Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America
Sequentially, product backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth
Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%
Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services, grew 8%
Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year
Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin
Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction
Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport
Moving to operating expenses
Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year-ago quarter
Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions
Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year
Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago
The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%
Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million, driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlement
Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year
We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion
During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions
Turning to our outlook
We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3%, including approximately $25 million of FX headwind, primarily driven by the British pound
We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03, including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds
Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations
We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2%, and we are raising non GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. Looking at regional results
America's revenue grew 3% driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America
Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR systems
EMEA revenue increased 27%, including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter
Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services
Asia Pac was flat versus last year, with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions
Finally, I'll end with some notable segment highlights
In our product segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our WAVE solution that makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications
WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks
Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers, which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world
We also won several notable deals that included an $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network, a $34 million reward to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California, and two P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million
In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile
Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business
We also grew double digits in our Command Center software business, driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions
Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police
This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg
Yes, Pierre
This is Gino
Managed services did grow year-over-year, as we said, excluding Airwave, up 8%
If we exclude Spillman and Interexport, managed and support services grew 4% in the quarter
So, in Q2, we mentioned in the prepared comments that part of it is the FX impact year-over-year of Airwave
We also have a project mix within Q2 versus the prior year
The headwinds in gross margin in Q2 are temporary
The Airwave-related FX impact diminishes in Q3 and Q4. And with respect to expenses, we continue to expect OpEx to be down year-over-year
On the last call, we guided to approximately $20 million to $25 million
Now our expectation with the addition of the acquisition OpEx is for OpEx to be down about $10 million to $15 million for the full year
Yeah, Colin (21:09)
The first thing we should articulate is that our expectation of gross margin for the year has not changed
And the Q2, as we described it as specific to Q2, there is no underlying trend and no change in expectation for full year margins
Unknown Speaker Okay
Thanks
And I guess one other point on that
I mean, you've had some larger projects over the past two years, LA-RICS, NÃ¸dnett in Norway
I wonder if you could add some color on potential device opportunities into those networks and how that may impact your product segment and margins going forward
This is Gino again, Colin (23:21)
The impact of Interexport is approximately $50 million for the full year and the non-GAAP EPS impact is approximately $0.03 for 2017. Unknown Speaker Okay
That's it from me
Thanks, guys
And Tavis, with respect to operating cash flow, the guidance for the full year was approximately $1.225 billion
We continue to expect that to be our operating cash flow number for the full year
We don't give forward guidance on the quarters as that moves around a little bit, but we continue to expect $1.225 billion for the full year
On integration services specifically or managed
and support services
Really no comment on integration services
That matches infrastructure deployments, and it kind of goes along with infrastructure deployments but no specific comments on integration services
Clearly, we're very pleased with the continued performance in managed and support services, continuing to grow mid-single digits recurring revenue, but no real commentary
Nothing really to comment on in Q1 with respect to systems integration
De minimis, Andrew
Very, very little
Primarily Services
