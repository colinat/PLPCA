56,"With respect to gross margins, in the release, we don't have the gross margin by segment"
57,"But as expected and recall during our last call, the guidance, our expectation was for gross margin to be down, driven primarily by a few things"
58,"One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment, catch-up"
59,adjustment year-to-date in 2016.

79,So it's all of the above
80,"It's a best guess, by the way"
81,Most important of that is less the composition of how it comes in by product or software bucket
