72,I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and expectations for Q4.
73,Ron?
74,Our success in all-flash arrays is broad and wide
75,"We have net new customers, we have new workloads within our existing customers, and upgrades within our install base"
76,"I would tell you that the net new customers and new workloads are materially bigger as a percentage of our all-flash business, reflected, for example, in the market share gains we're seeing in the SAN business, rather than our traditional install base"
77,"As percentage of our install base, all-flash FAS is a very small percentage"
78,It's less than 10% of the deployed install base
79,So we've got lots of headroom to go
80,Let me take the first question
81,We are seeing momentum both because we have a compellingly differentiated product set
82,"As we have noted, the all-flash market is now going from early adopter to the mainstream market where customers are moving entire disk-based estates over to solid-state and therefore require the full range of features in their all-flash arrays from a business process, from a data management protection and availability perspective"
83,"Both all-flash FAS, as well as SolidFire give customers a compellingly differentiated platform; and the EF-Series is the fastest performing box in the industry"
84,"I think, in addition, we are clearly seeing disarray at our competitors"
85,"Our leading competitors, neither have the flagship flash product, as well as going through substantial challenges from an integration perspective"
86,"And customers are looking to NetApp to give them a path forward for their all-flash estates, as well as to the hybrid cloud"
87,"I think, first of all, in the competitive landscape, things have not changed substantially"
88,"As we said, the major competitor that we go up for the majority of the deals are the large system manufacturers, most notably EMC and the other high-end SAN arrays that we are displacing with all-flash FAS"
89,"HP has always been the low-price leader, and they lack the feature set in terms of data management services"
90,So they compete aggressively on price
91,"And the startups are increasingly challenged to differentiate themselves, and so you see evidence of desperation from various different smaller startup players"
92,I'll just leave it there
93,"Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth"
94,"In terms of the strategic numbers, it's only product revenue that comprises the strategic number"
95,"Our all-flash array number includes products and services, right?"
96,"I think when you think about all-flash versus hybrid flash arrays, I mean, they're essentially solutions we offer customers"
97,"Some customers, for their workloads, choose all-flash solutions and some customers choose hybrid solutions"
98,We have a unique advantage in the market that we are able to offer customers choice with the same set of data management capabilities
99,"So if the price of NAND rises unexpectedly, we can always offer them a hybrid solution which no one else in the market can offer"
100,"We have NVMe support in the flash arrays that we introduced to market, so the flat FAS9000, the 8200, 2600 series all have NVMe integrated onboard for a low latency cash"
101,We also have in the A700s a NVMe over fabric ready architecture
102,NVMe will become just like fiber channel
103,It'll take time to get adopted and become deployable widely at customers as a true storage solution
104,"We're working with the industry to make that available, and it will become part of every platform"
105,I don't think there is meaningful differentiation from NVMe
106,"I think, as I've said continuously, proven data management capabilities, integration in the application domain, and delivering business value will be the composition with customers"
107,"NVMe will become a check box that all of us will have, us included"
108,"First of all, in terms of the cost savings that we have taken on, it's a transformation across all aspects of the business"
109,"I would say in the product portfolio, it is to leverage the capabilities that the supply chain has to not only meaningfully reduce the cost of introducing new hardware platforms, but actually accelerate the pace at which we are introducing new hardware platforms"
110,The recent lineup of FAS hardware platforms were introduced at 3 times lower cost of introduction and three 3 faster
111,So we're substantially better in terms of the way we build systems and hardware
112,"The second is in terms of our shared services environments, we've consolidated the operations of many of our back end functions into a shared services platform"
113,"There's continuing work to be done to complete that transition, but that offers promise of not only savings for this year, but in years to come by being much more efficient"
114,"Things like reporting, payroll administration, various elements of human resources and so on will be delivered from a centralized shared services facility rather than close to the employees, giving us both consistency and operating leverage"
115,"And in the go-to-market area, as you can see, the work that we have done, particularly in the services business, have materially improved the profitability of that line"
116,"We've integrated, for example, self-service support, online chat as opposed to human support"
117,"And you'll see us integrating advances in machine learning so that customers can both get better satisfaction, but at a lower cost"
118,So we remain committed to doing that
119,"As we think about the savings that we generate, we'll continue to look at all of the options that are in front of us, right?"
120,"Returning some of that through improved profitability to shareholders, as well as investing in the long-term growth of the business"
121,One of the meaningful areas that we've invested in is SolidFire
122,"And you can see, we're not only leveraging that investment in the all-flash array segment, but to deliver a compellingly differentiated hyper-converged offering to the market"
123,I think the install base of units is growing at a faster rate now
124,"I think in terms of the systems, life cycle continues to expand, right?"
125,"So I think the continued extension of life cycle is what causes the install base to have legs and growth, right, in addition to the product revenue growth that we're seeing now,"
126,so
127,Okay
128,"Let me take the first one, and Ron will take the second"
129,"I think in terms of our approach to media prices, we've generally taken the position that we will pass on whatever cost structure being offered to us, benefit or disadvantage, from the media manufacturers to our customers"
130,I think the caution is really reflecting the dynamic nature of SSD availability and pricing
131,"As we noted, we've put in place the capability to meet a short supply"
132,"We're wanting to guarantee a short supply to our end customers, and that has been a priority ahead of specific pricing agreements"
133,"From a channel program perspective, we've started to see the beginnings of an integrated channel program from EMC"
134,I'll just tell you that incentives are just a small part of the total value proposition that a channel partner looks for from their supplier
135,"I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners"
136,"So we're going to continue to attack with the full breadth of our channel, and we are making progress as our results note"
137,"They are solutions that are fixed configurations of our Clustered ONTAP and all-flash FAS products that make it easy for the channel to procure, and we did include that in a couple of the past quarters"
138,So there's a slight adjustment for that
139,The second question was on amortization
140,We have a broad book of business around the world
141,"I would just tell you our book of business is affected by GDP outlook, as well as the competitiveness of our portfolio and execution against those opportunities"
142,We didn't notice any specific change in pattern through the course of the quarter across the broad base of geographies that we serve
143,Yeah
144,We expect the trend to continue the same
145,"I think through the course of the quarter, we saw a strong year-end budget flush"
146,We saw January return to fairly normal patterns of uncertainty across the geographies that we serve and saw linearity similar to normal sort of back end
147,loaded quarters
148,", right?"
149,"I think in terms of the segments of the market that we serve, I think our pivot is targeting the faster growing parts of the market"
150,"So there's a lot more interest as a share of wallet for the technologies that we're offering today, like solid-state, next-generation data centers, object storage, as well as what we're thinking about delivering to market in the hyper-converged space"
151,"I think in terms of traditional environments, you continue to see people sweat assets trying to get longer lifecycles out of that"
152,We're benefiting from the fact that we've got a differentiated portfolio
153,We're benefiting from the fact that the portfolio is targeting the places where customers are spending
154,"And, frankly, we're benefiting from the fact that Clustered ONTAP significantly and substantially transforms the cost structure for legacy frame array"
155,We can go in there at an order of magnitude greater efficiency and enable lots more software features than they've historically had
156,We'll give you more details of the long-term outlook at our Analyst Conference
157,I can just tell you that we are increasingly seeing wins where people are using NetApp Private Storage solutions connected to public cloud providers
158,And what we've always said is we anticipate returning the company to moderated revenue growth
159,"Our focus on transformation allows that moderated revenue growth to generate substantial returns to shareholders, and we're delivering on that commitment right now"
160,"I think if you look at our results today, we are gaining share in the markets that we serve"
161,"In the all-flash array market, there's no question we're growing faster than competitors, big and small"
162,"I think if you look at the storage and device management market, we took over the number one position from EMC in that market"
163,"We've made solid progress in Clustered ONTAP in terms of transitioning our install base, and are doing so with greater operating margin leverage"
164,"As we indicated on the call, we are working on a next-generation hyper-converged solution which we think will allow us to do to the hyper-converged market what we did to the all-flash array market: serve the needs of mainstream customers with a platform that's differentiated with performance, enterprise data management capabilities, and hybrid cloud integration"
165,We think that's what the market wants
166,"And we're focused and going to be delivering that, and you'll see us make some exciting announcements early next fiscal year"
167,It isn't a net new market that we serve
168,It will allow us to serve the system or virtualization administrator at customers rather than the storage administrators
169,The hyper-converged market today is sort of a first-generation solution
170,The solutions don't have enterprise data management features
171,"They have challenges with performance consistency, which requires them to become a single workload configuration and are, therefore, addressing the low-end market, the departmental market"
172,There are few solutions that can really serve anything broader than that market
173,"What we're trying to bring to customers, just like we did in the all-flash array market, is a solution that allows customers the benefits of ease of administration, but with the unique benefits of performance and scalability, enterprise data management and hybrid cloud integration, which really gives us a net new market to address"
174,"As I've said, as part of our transformation efforts we have continued to leverage the supply chain, the industry supply chain, to build technology for us"
175,"If you look at the recent A700s flash-optimized, NVMe fabric ready architecture, it was sourced by – off the – an ODM model, right?"
176,"So we are expanding the range of usage of off the line platforms across the range of our business, both in SolidFire as well as in our traditional FAS business"
177,"Could you speak up a little bit, please?"
178,Kulbinder S
179,Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
180,LLC
181,I'm sorry
182,"A question on gross margins, again"
183,Did you say that the gross margins between the mature and the strategic segment are pretty similar?
184,We've had also been running promotions to get our customer base transitioned from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP
185,"As we announced this quarter, those promotions – we've transitioned 50% of the capacity in our install base to Clustered ONTAP, and so we're seriously evaluating whether we need to continue those promotions"
186,Kulbinder S
187,Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
188,LLC
189,"And so, would you say we're near the trough on gross margins, then?"
190,"I think in both of those cases, our perspective is the long-term winner, as we have demonstrated in the all-flash array market, is the one that can take an architecture and serve the mainstream customer segment"
191,There have been lots of companies that have gone after the early-adopter segment with a subset of the features that enterprise customers really want and have failed in the long run
192,"And so, first to market doesn't necessarily mean the big winner, right?"
193,"I think what we are trying to do with the hyper-converged segment is the same track record that we've demonstrated with the all-flash array segment, which is customers want mature enterprise data management features"
194,"They want performance consistency and scalability, so that they don't have to have operationally a siloed environment"
195,"And hybrid cloud is really the architecture of the data center going forward, and they want true hybrid cloud integration"
196,"And so, we think that by offering those capabilities to customers, we will redefine the hyper-converged market just like we did to the all-flash array market"
197,The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability
198,We're expanding our opportunity by addressing an increasing range of strategic customer use cases
199,"We've completely refreshed our portfolio of hybrid and all-flash arrays, delivered an industry-leading storage efficiency guarantee to the market, expanding our cloud-based services, and soon we will introduce a next-generation Hyper converged solution"
200,All of this underpins our growing confidence in the future
201,We hope to see you in April at our investor event where we will talk more about the evolution of NetApp to lead in the next era of IT
