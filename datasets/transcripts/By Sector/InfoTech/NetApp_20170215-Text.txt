Thanks, Kris
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us
We executed well in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, again delivering solid results with revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and both operating margin and earnings per share above our guidance
Our innovation in emerging areas of the market is expanding and creating new growth opportunities for us
In the quarter, we strengthened our industry-leading portfolio with the introduction of new all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud solutions, positioning us to address a growing set of customer use cases
With focus and disciplined execution, we are successfully innovating to meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base while at the same time streamlining our business
As we deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, we remain focused on three priorities
First, our Data Fabric platform and the strategic solutions that are built for the opportunities of a data-centric world
Second, lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate
And third, a robust capital allocation program, which includes the mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business
I'll begin with an update on our first priority
Ron will update you on the other two
Our strategic solutions position us to lead in the new era of IT
These flash-enabled, cloud-integrated offerings provide customers with the future proof solutions required for success in a data-centric world
In Q3, strategic solutions constituted 65% of net product revenue, up 22% year-over-year
Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined 18% year-over-year
As we've said in the past, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Consistent with the plan we've laid out and as you saw in our Q3 results and Q4 guidance included in our press release, the momentum of our strategic solutions is already delivering top line growth
Customers are maximizing the value of their data by prioritizing investments to modernize the data centers, increase agility, and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments
Clustered ONTAP allows customers to modernize their infrastructure by replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with a scale-out, software-defined shared storage platform
Uniquely in the storage industry, Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications with the ability to consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository for improved efficiency
Clustered ONTAP continues to perform very well
We are gaining new customers, expanding our footprint with existing customers and successfully migrating our install base
In Q3, Clustered ONTAP was deployed on over 90% of FAS systems shipped
Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew 24% year-over-year, and the install base of FAS systems continues to grow
And Clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 40% of systems in that large and growing install base
Additionally, we reached an exciting milestone this quarter which underscores the momentum we've had with Clustered ONTAP
Clustered ONTAP now manages over 50% of the FAS system capacity in our install base
Flash is the mainstream choice for new on-premises deployments as customers seek to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications
NetApp leads the industry in the transition to flash with cloud-integrated solutions that provide unrivaled efficiency, speed, scale and data management
Per IDC's calendar Q4, all-flash array market data, we strengthened our number two position
And our growth in flash continues to outpace both the market and our competition, large and small
Although NAND supply is tight, we are confident in our ability to meet demand and we expect our share gains to continue
In our third quarter, our all-flash array business grew 160% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $1.4 billion, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire product and services
The majority of our all-flash array business is driven by Clustered ONTAP, deployed at both FAS engineered systems and FlexPod converged infrastructure solutions
This year, we have refreshed our entire all-flash FAS portfolio with the A-Series designed specifically for flash and are experiencing strong adoption of these new products
The A-Series all-flash systems deliver industry-leading performance, capacity, scalability, security and network connectivity in dense form factors
In Q3, we introduced a new entry-level system which extends enterprise-grade flash to midsize businesses
At the start of Q4, we announced a new high-end system which continues NetApp's track record for innovation with an NVMe fabric-ready clustered architecture
We also enhanced our storage efficiency capabilities and introduced an industry-leading workload-specific guarantee that scales to a 5-to-1 data reduction ratio
The beginning of February marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of SolidFire
SolidFire creates an avenue of growth for us to address customers' data requirements as they build out next-generation data centers
We are growing the SolidFire business through the expanded reach of NetApp, acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers
We are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure built on SolidFire innovation
We will do what has not yet been done by the immature first generation of hyper-converged solutions, bringing hyper-converged infrastructure to the enterprise by allowing customers the flexibility to run multiple workloads without compromising performance, scale or efficiency
As part of the data fabric platform, it will also be the first fully cloud-integrated ACI solution, giving customers the ability to leverage their data across on-premises, public cloud and hybrid cloud environments
With this innovation, we further broaden our industry-leading portfolio with cloud-integrated solutions available in stand-alone, converged, hyper-converged and software-defined offerings
We will have more information on the development of this exciting new solution for you in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The NetApp data fabric enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers
This allows customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources
IT organizations can be more responsive to the needs of the business by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources
We continue innovating in this space, and at the start of the third quarter announced new data fabric services
These as-a-service and consumption-based offerings allow customers to control, manage, secure and move data across on-premises and public cloud resources
By providing data portability and cloud integration, we are increasing our strategic relevance and expanding our opportunity
Customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies
A large U.S
-based insurance company chose NetApp Private Storage for cloud to leverage the elasticity of the cloud to spin up or down computer network as needed for quantitative research and analysis while keeping full control of their data
A large North American-based retailer selected NetApp all-flash FAS to replace its legacy EMC SAN infrastructure because we solved their current application integration, replication and management challenges with a compelling path to hybrid cloud
At a cloud-based talent management solution provider, we displaced over 1 petabyte of legacy EMC and HP storage for the company's production and disaster recovery environments
Our cloud integration and the ability to scale with their business were key factors in the customer's decision for NetApp
Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, and I want to re-emphasize our commitment to both priorities
We're helping customers transform their businesses for success in the data-powered digital era by enabling their efforts to modernize their infrastructure, build next-generation data centers and harness the power of the hybrid cloud
With our powerful portfolio of innovative solutions and data fabric strategy, we have enormous opportunity to lead in this next year of IT
I remain extremely confident in our ability to successfully execute against this opportunity
The transformation of NetApp is yielding results and has changed the trajectory of our business
We have a sharp focus on delivering innovation to address an expanding range of customer requirements in the fastest-growing parts of the market, while lowering our cost structure and streamlining the business
We've improved our agility and are delivering innovation at an accelerated pace
With continued execution, we're on track to increase shareholder value and return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range
We will hold an Investor Day in New York on April 5, where we will share more detail on the evolution of NetApp to lead in the data-powered digital era, as well as our multi-year business outlook
We hope that you'll be able to join us
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and expectations for Q4. Ron?
Our success in all-flash arrays is broad and wide
We have net new customers, we have new workloads within our existing customers, and upgrades within our install base
I would tell you that the net new customers and new workloads are materially bigger as a percentage of our all-flash business, reflected, for example, in the market share gains we're seeing in the SAN business, rather than our traditional install base
As percentage of our install base, all-flash FAS is a very small percentage
It's less than 10% of the deployed install base
So we've got lots of headroom to go
Let me take the first question
We are seeing momentum both because we have a compellingly differentiated product set
As we have noted, the all-flash market is now going from early adopter to the mainstream market where customers are moving entire disk-based estates over to solid-state and therefore require the full range of features in their all-flash arrays from a business process, from a data management protection and availability perspective
Both all-flash FAS, as well as SolidFire give customers a compellingly differentiated platform; and the EF-Series is the fastest performing box in the industry
I think, in addition, we are clearly seeing disarray at our competitors
Our leading competitors, neither have the flagship flash product, as well as going through substantial challenges from an integration perspective
And customers are looking to NetApp to give them a path forward for their all-flash estates, as well as to the hybrid cloud
I think, first of all, in the competitive landscape, things have not changed substantially
As we said, the major competitor that we go up for the majority of the deals are the large system manufacturers, most notably EMC and the other high-end SAN arrays that we are displacing with all-flash FAS
HP has always been the low-price leader, and they lack the feature set in terms of data management services
So they compete aggressively on price
And the startups are increasingly challenged to differentiate themselves, and so you see evidence of desperation from various different smaller startup players
I'll just leave it there
Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth
In terms of the strategic numbers, it's only product revenue that comprises the strategic number
Our all-flash array number includes products and services, right? I think when you think about all-flash versus hybrid flash arrays, I mean, they're essentially solutions we offer customers
Some customers, for their workloads, choose all-flash solutions and some customers choose hybrid solutions
We have a unique advantage in the market that we are able to offer customers choice with the same set of data management capabilities
So if the price of NAND rises unexpectedly, we can always offer them a hybrid solution which no one else in the market can offer
We have NVMe support in the flash arrays that we introduced to market, so the flat FAS9000, the 8200, 2600 series all have NVMe integrated onboard for a low latency cash
We also have in the A700s a NVMe over fabric ready architecture
NVMe will become just like fiber channel
It'll take time to get adopted and become deployable widely at customers as a true storage solution
We're working with the industry to make that available, and it will become part of every platform
I don't think there is meaningful differentiation from NVMe
I think, as I've said continuously, proven data management capabilities, integration in the application domain, and delivering business value will be the composition with customers
NVMe will become a check box that all of us will have, us included
First of all, in terms of the cost savings that we have taken on, it's a transformation across all aspects of the business
I would say in the product portfolio, it is to leverage the capabilities that the supply chain has to not only meaningfully reduce the cost of introducing new hardware platforms, but actually accelerate the pace at which we are introducing new hardware platforms
The recent lineup of FAS hardware platforms were introduced at 3 times lower cost of introduction and three 3 faster
So we're substantially better in terms of the way we build systems and hardware
The second is in terms of our shared services environments, we've consolidated the operations of many of our back end functions into a shared services platform
There's continuing work to be done to complete that transition, but that offers promise of not only savings for this year, but in years to come by being much more efficient
Things like reporting, payroll administration, various elements of human resources and so on will be delivered from a centralized shared services facility rather than close to the employees, giving us both consistency and operating leverage
And in the go-to-market area, as you can see, the work that we have done, particularly in the services business, have materially improved the profitability of that line
We've integrated, for example, self-service support, online chat as opposed to human support
And you'll see us integrating advances in machine learning so that customers can both get better satisfaction, but at a lower cost
So we remain committed to doing that
As we think about the savings that we generate, we'll continue to look at all of the options that are in front of us, right? Returning some of that through improved profitability to shareholders, as well as investing in the long-term growth of the business
One of the meaningful areas that we've invested in is SolidFire
And you can see, we're not only leveraging that investment in the all-flash array segment, but to deliver a compellingly differentiated hyper-converged offering to the market
I think the install base of units is growing at a faster rate now
I think in terms of the systems, life cycle continues to expand, right? So I think the continued extension of life cycle is what causes the install base to have legs and growth, right, in addition to the product revenue growth that we're seeing now, so
Okay
Let me take the first one, and Ron will take the second
I think in terms of our approach to media prices, we've generally taken the position that we will pass on whatever cost structure being offered to us, benefit or disadvantage, from the media manufacturers to our customers
I think the caution is really reflecting the dynamic nature of SSD availability and pricing
As we noted, we've put in place the capability to meet a short supply
We're wanting to guarantee a short supply to our end customers, and that has been a priority ahead of specific pricing agreements
From a channel program perspective, we've started to see the beginnings of an integrated channel program from EMC
I'll just tell you that incentives are just a small part of the total value proposition that a channel partner looks for from their supplier
I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners
So we're going to continue to attack with the full breadth of our channel, and we are making progress as our results note
They are solutions that are fixed configurations of our Clustered ONTAP and all-flash FAS products that make it easy for the channel to procure, and we did include that in a couple of the past quarters
So there's a slight adjustment for that
The second question was on amortization
We have a broad book of business around the world
I would just tell you our book of business is affected by GDP outlook, as well as the competitiveness of our portfolio and execution against those opportunities
We didn't notice any specific change in pattern through the course of the quarter across the broad base of geographies that we serve
Yeah
We expect the trend to continue the same
I think through the course of the quarter, we saw a strong year-end budget flush
We saw January return to fairly normal patterns of uncertainty across the geographies that we serve and saw linearity similar to normal sort of back end loaded quarters, right? I think in terms of the segments of the market that we serve, I think our pivot is targeting the faster growing parts of the market
So there's a lot more interest as a share of wallet for the technologies that we're offering today, like solid-state, next-generation data centers, object storage, as well as what we're thinking about delivering to market in the hyper-converged space
I think in terms of traditional environments, you continue to see people sweat assets trying to get longer lifecycles out of that
We're benefiting from the fact that we've got a differentiated portfolio
We're benefiting from the fact that the portfolio is targeting the places where customers are spending
And, frankly, we're benefiting from the fact that Clustered ONTAP significantly and substantially transforms the cost structure for legacy frame array
We can go in there at an order of magnitude greater efficiency and enable lots more software features than they've historically had
We'll give you more details of the long-term outlook at our Analyst Conference
I can just tell you that we are increasingly seeing wins where people are using NetApp Private Storage solutions connected to public cloud providers
And what we've always said is we anticipate returning the company to moderated revenue growth
Our focus on transformation allows that moderated revenue growth to generate substantial returns to shareholders, and we're delivering on that commitment right now
I think if you look at our results today, we are gaining share in the markets that we serve
In the all-flash array market, there's no question we're growing faster than competitors, big and small
I think if you look at the storage and device management market, we took over the number one position from EMC in that market
We've made solid progress in Clustered ONTAP in terms of transitioning our install base, and are doing so with greater operating margin leverage
As we indicated on the call, we are working on a next-generation hyper-converged solution which we think will allow us to do to the hyper-converged market what we did to the all-flash array market: serve the needs of mainstream customers with a platform that's differentiated with performance, enterprise data management capabilities, and hybrid cloud integration
We think that's what the market wants
And we're focused and going to be delivering that, and you'll see us make some exciting announcements early next fiscal year
It isn't a net new market that we serve
It will allow us to serve the system or virtualization administrator at customers rather than the storage administrators
The hyper-converged market today is sort of a first-generation solution
The solutions don't have enterprise data management features
They have challenges with performance consistency, which requires them to become a single workload configuration and are, therefore, addressing the low-end market, the departmental market
There are few solutions that can really serve anything broader than that market
What we're trying to bring to customers, just like we did in the all-flash array market, is a solution that allows customers the benefits of ease of administration, but with the unique benefits of performance and scalability, enterprise data management and hybrid cloud integration, which really gives us a net new market to address
As I've said, as part of our transformation efforts we have continued to leverage the supply chain, the industry supply chain, to build technology for us
If you look at the recent A700s flash-optimized, NVMe fabric ready architecture, it was sourced by – off the – an ODM model, right? So we are expanding the range of usage of off the line platforms across the range of our business, both in SolidFire as well as in our traditional FAS business
Could you speak up a little bit, please? Kulbinder S
Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC I'm sorry
A question on gross margins, again
Did you say that the gross margins between the mature and the strategic segment are pretty similar?
We've had also been running promotions to get our customer base transitioned from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP
As we announced this quarter, those promotions – we've transitioned 50% of the capacity in our install base to Clustered ONTAP, and so we're seriously evaluating whether we need to continue those promotions
Kulbinder S
Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC And so, would you say we're near the trough on gross margins, then?
I think in both of those cases, our perspective is the long-term winner, as we have demonstrated in the all-flash array market, is the one that can take an architecture and serve the mainstream customer segment
There have been lots of companies that have gone after the early-adopter segment with a subset of the features that enterprise customers really want and have failed in the long run
And so, first to market doesn't necessarily mean the big winner, right? I think what we are trying to do with the hyper-converged segment is the same track record that we've demonstrated with the all-flash array segment, which is customers want mature enterprise data management features
They want performance consistency and scalability, so that they don't have to have operationally a siloed environment
And hybrid cloud is really the architecture of the data center going forward, and they want true hybrid cloud integration
And so, we think that by offering those capabilities to customers, we will redefine the hyper-converged market just like we did to the all-flash array market
The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability
We're expanding our opportunity by addressing an increasing range of strategic customer use cases
We've completely refreshed our portfolio of hybrid and all-flash arrays, delivered an industry-leading storage efficiency guarantee to the market, expanding our cloud-based services, and soon we will introduce a next-generation Hyper converged solution
All of this underpins our growing confidence in the future
We hope to see you in April at our investor event where we will talk more about the evolution of NetApp to lead in the next era of IT
