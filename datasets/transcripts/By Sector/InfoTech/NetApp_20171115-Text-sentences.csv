0,"Good afternoon, everyone"
1,Thank you for joining us today
2,"I am very pleased to report another strong quarter with revenue above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share all above our guidance"
3,We saw a solid demand environment in all geographies and strong customer interest in our industry-leading solutions
4,I am proud of our continued progress in transforming NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth
5,Our strong performance reflects our customers' commitment to NetApp and their clear and growing preference for the value of our Data Fabric strategy
6,We are undoubtedly out executing our competition on all fronts
7,"In the second quarter, we launched innovative new products and grew our business in new areas"
8,It's been particularly exciting to see our cloud strategy pay off with our expanded relationship with Microsoft Azure and the industry's first Azure enterprise NFS service
9,"In the new era of IT, driven by digital transformation and defined by the ubiquitous hybrid clouds, IoT and machine learning, NetApp is uniquely positioned as the leader in helping organizations liberate and unleash their data for maximum business impact"
10,"We enable customers to meet the exponential data growth of the digital era where they must manage a complex hybrid world with data in the data center, the cloud and in edge computing, and externally linked applications and platforms"
11,"Unlike competitors' approaches, which are siloed and do not embrace the cloud, we help organizations unify their data across the widest range of cloud and on-premises environments to realize its full value for competitive advantage"
12,"Data is at the heart of company's digital transformation, and we are winning because we are enabling customers' success through data"
13,"No one matches our expertise in data management, our leadership in growing market segments and our open ecosystem approach"
14,"Our advantage is the result of decades of software-based innovation, strategic focus and the ability to partner effectively"
15,"Before giving you an update on the set of strategic solutions that are tightly aligned to customers' IT imperatives, I want to give a brief update on the dynamics in our mature solutions"
16,"Consistent with our plan, the headwinds for mature solutions continue to lessen"
17,"In the second quarter, product revenue from mature solutions declined 3% year-over-year"
18,The transition from 7-mode to Clustered ONTAP is behind us
19,"Our add-on hardware business is growing, and we have a renewed focus on hardware and software OEM opportunities"
20,"In the coming quarters, the headwinds for mature solutions could abate and could possibly provide some support for additional top line growth"
21,"As a part of our transformation, we have aligned tightly to our customers' IT imperatives as they harness the power of cloud, build next-generation data centers and modernize their existing storage infrastructure"
22,This has resulted in a differentiated strategic solutions portfolio focused on the growth areas of the market
23,And we continue to bring innovative solutions to more customers in more ways
24,"As I noted last quarter, we have already transitioned our business away from the declining segments to the data-driven high-growth segments of all-flash arrays, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud"
25,"The success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which were 69% of net product revenue in Q2, up 23% year-over-year"
26,Customers are moving to all-flash arrays as they modernize existing data centers and build next-generation data centers to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications
27,This shift creates enormous new opportunity for us as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors' equipment with our cloud-integrated all-flash solution
28,"We continue to substantially outpace the growth of the all-flash array market and competitors, both large and small"
29,"In Q2, our all-flash array business, inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew about 60% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion"
30,Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets
31,Our clustered storage solutions have substantial and structural technological advantages over competitors' SAN products
32,"This is enabling us to gain share in the SAN market, both in new customer acquisitions and in greater share of wallet within existing customers as we displace legacy competitive SAN installations"
33,The all-flash FlexPod again helped to strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 20% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC's Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker for calendar Q2 2017.
34,We continue to outpace and win against full stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution
35,"In Q2, we delivered new innovations that further strengthened our leadership position in the all-flash array market"
36,"The latest version of ONTAP offers 40% increased performance over earlier versions, helps companies increase capacity savings by 30% and offers stronger security and new compliance capabilities"
37,This expands upon the performance leadership of the world-record SPEC SFS performance benchmark that we set earlier in the quarter
38,"The new EF570 all-flash array designed specifically for performance-intensive workloads such as big data analytics, technical computing and video surveillance, leads both the SPC-1 and SPC-2 benchmarks for price performance and is the first enterprise all-flash array to support NVMe over InfiniBand for ultra-low-latency applications"
39,The newest SolidFire Element OS helps customers align business goals to IT service levels with new user-defined quality of service policies to further simplify performance management in rapidly evolving private clouds
40,NetApp's SnapMirror integration supports data movement from Element OS systems to ONTAP systems across the Data Fabric
41,"These SolidFire innovations are incorporated in NetApp HCI, the first enterprise-scale hyper-converged infrastructure solution which began shipping at the end of Q2."
42,"We enable customers to overcome the limitations of inflexible first-generation HCI products that strand resources, throttle the performance acquired by next-generation applications and are not able to consolidate workloads"
43,Customers are excited that we are delivering on all of the promises of HCI and we are seeing strong demand for this offering
44,"More and more customers, partners and service providers are choosing NetApp because of our hybrid cloud strategy"
45,Our recent industry-first announcement with Microsoft Azure is clear evidence of the strength of this strategy
46,This enterprise NFS service in the cloud will be delivered natively in Azure and powered by NetApp
47,"Users will access this service directly through the Azure console and continue to get the scale, performance and reliability offered by NetApp's leading data services"
48,NetApp is unique in its approach to collaborating with the hyperscalers and has defined the best-in-class model for helping our joint customers deploy hybrid cloud
49,"We have partnerships with all the leading hyperscalers, which enable us to deliver NetApp enterprise value through their massive cloud infrastructures"
50,These relationships allow us to monetize customers' use of the cloud and increase our opportunity to expand our market share in the on-premises market
51,I could not be more excited about the possibilities created by this part of our business
52,We are building on a solid foundation that is generating profitable growth today and positions us for continued growth in the future
53,We remain focused on three priorities
54,We are aligning to the high-growth areas of the market and reaching more customers in more ways
55,We are continuing our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity to expand our innovation
56,"And we are maintaining our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth"
57,Our second quarter results are a strong indicator that the transformation of NetApp remains on track and is accelerating our success with customers
58,It's clear that our strong execution and Data Fabric strategy are enabling us to build deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world
59,"At our recent Insight User Conference, thousands of customers and partners shared their excitement for our strategic direction and long-term vision"
60,We expect our improved momentum to continue throughout the year
61,"We are the data authority for the hybrid cloud, planning for the future, leveraging our technologies and scale to create new businesses, expanding our total available market and creating shareholder value"
62,"Before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to thank the NetApp team for your focus, commitment to transformation and the exceptional results that we are delivering together"
63,Ron?
64,"I think we're very, very pleased with the performance of our sales team"
65,We saw exceptional execution across all of the different geographies and all of the different segments of the business
66,"And we are extraordinarily â€“ see very, very good momentum"
67,We have a differentiated product portfolio
68,We have strength in all of our different channels of distribution
69,Our Data Fabric strategy is resonating with customers and the sharp focus of our field organization gives us extraordinary confidence in the business looking forward
70,We introduced the hyper-converged platform in October just this past month
71,We are excited at the demand that we've seen for the product
72,It has exceeded our expectations
73,We also booked some orders and we're focused on converting the rest of our pipeline this quarter
74,So we've got really good momentum
75,And we see a lot of customer interest
76,"We have a differentiated offering, delivering on the promise that hyper-converged gave customers with an enterprise-grade solution"
77,"We continue to see very, very good momentum displacing competition to gain wallet share"
78,One of our competitive programs has seen continued increases in the number of competitive displacements per day
79,"This quarter, we saw more than two competitive displacements per day, which is up substantially from the numbers we reported the last quarter"
80,"The majority of our flash footprint is net new wallet share in customers at the expense of legacy frame SAN arrays from our competitors like HP, IBM and EMC"
81,We still see substantial room to run
82,We are still in the early innings of flash adoption in our customer base
83,"We have an extraordinarily differentiated flash portfolio, as I mentioned in my comments"
84,"We have several world-record performance benchmarks, a deeply differentiated software portfolio, and we continue to see strong momentum going forward"
85,We're not providing guidance for fiscal 2019.
86,"As Ron mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are raising the guidance for the second half of the year"
87,"So, as we see continued acceleration in the business and, for the full year, as we said, we would guide to mid-single digits, up from low-single digits"
88,I won't break out the hyper-converged
89,I'll just say it's part of that up-leveling of the number
90,And we feel very good about the offering we have in the market and the momentum we're seeing
91,That's a 2019 phenomenon
92,"The enterprise Azure NFS service, we are very, very excited at the prospects to expand our reach to new customers in more ways and partnering with one of the world's leading hyperscale cloud service provider"
93,It's in private preview next month and will be generally available for customer adoption next fiscal year
94,"So, this year, we're not counting that in the materiality of our business"
95,We will give you more color in our next Analyst Day in spring
96,But I do think it will be an additional growth driver for the company
97,"I think the way I look at it we are riding several long-term secular trends: data growth and the criticality of data in a digital business; major technological transitions like solid-state storage, converged infrastructure and the cloud"
98,"We have a differentiated strategy for customers, the Data Fabric strategy, which is very, very difficult for people to replicate"
99,"As you know, we've been working on this for five years"
100,We also have a vastly differentiated innovation portfolio with many years of differentiated software innovation that positions us to build the Data Fabric and deliver it in compelling products
101,And our execution has been really strong
102,"So we feel we have a lot of headroom to continue to take the business, and we are going to double down on it"
103,And we see strong momentum heading into the second half of the year
104,We saw good momentum in the public sector market
105,"The book of business, as you know, we have a broad-based book of business because we are the unquestioned market leader in the public sector market"
106,It reflects the spending priorities of the administration
107,"So, defense and intelligence were strong, reflecting the budget allocations that they received"
108,But we were â€“ overall
109,", we feel confident that we gained share"
110,We saw the normal year-end budget flush across all of the different segments in public sector
111,Our enterprise book of business was also very good
112,It was very strong across all of the geographies
113,"We saw strength in â€“ particular strength in the Americas and in Asia Pacific, but good balanced book of business across the board"
114,"We have got NVMe over Fabrics deployed in our EF-Series, EF570 Series product"
115,We have NVMe over InfiniBand in that product for ultra-low-latency use cases especially in financial trading applications or in real-time analysis or fraud detection types of applications
116,"We have NVMe support in our FAS series of products, where the NVMe is used as a low-latency cash"
117,"And we see that this is exactly the trend that enables people to get the benefits of shared storage, efficiency, single point of management, consolidation of footprint while getting the benefits of low latency and host connectivity"
118,"And so we do see that over time, as NVMe becomes more mature, it will become a big enabler"
119,It will be a good enabler to network storage like you mentioned
120,Cisco continues to be a really strong partner of NetApp
121,Our strength in flash combined with the capabilities of the UCS and intent-based networking from Cisco is driving meaningful growth in the FlexPod business
122,"As you noticed, 20% in the converged infrastructure business is substantially ahead of any other full stack vendor in the market"
123,And so we are gaining share from competitors of both of our companies
124,"Fujitsu and NetApp have had a long-standing relationship of more than 20 years of joint engineering, as well as we have gone to market together in many parts of Europe together"
125,The NFLEX solution with a simple converged infrastructure solution that combines compute from Fujitsu with storage from NetApp and is targeted at the EMEA market
126,"It is for customers who are looking for a simple preconfigured factory-built solution, which is different than what we have with FlexPod, which is much more flexible and customizable"
127,And it's targeting places where Fujitsu has built customer relationships and loyalty
128,So it expands our reach and it provides us with another opportunity to compete more broadly in parts of the world that we didn't address as successfully before
129,"First of all, I think the 7% number is correct"
130,"As we mentioned before, we see, in the normal seasonality of the business, the revenue growth rate to accelerate through the second half of the year, and this is consistent despite the fact that we've had a strong first half and it reflects our continued momentum"
131,"It reflects the broad book of business that we're seeing, reflective of the mature solutions just posted a 23% year-on-year growth, growth; the strategic solutions just posted 23% year-on-year growth"
132,We continue to see that broad portfolio continuing to see accelerate
133,"Mature is almost flat now year-on-year, just down 3%, so the headwind for mature is going to decline"
134,We continue to see gains in SAN
135,and we have hyper-converged
136,So we feel very good about our portfolio and our execution in the marketplace
137,"With regard to FX, I'll have Ron comment on that"
138,"I think, first of all, the 7% number was aggregate revenue, not product revenue"
139,We're not going to break out the guide of product versus services
140,But the 7% number that you impute is aggregate revenue
141,So we see continued acceleration of our business through the second half of this year
142,"With regard to our portfolio of innovation, we are winning both on-premises deployments as well as net new customer logos because of our Data Fabric strategy"
143,"I think that is aligned with customers' spending priorities and it is the best investment protection argument that any vendor in the marketplace can offer customers, which is, you can start with us on the cloud and move your data on premises"
144,You can start with us on premises and take your data with you seamlessly to wherever you want to go
145,"So, the overall value proposition that we've spent years developing is clearly resonating as customers deploy the hybrid cloud"
146,"In addition, our individual solutions that underpin the Data Fabric are also very strong"
147,We've got a compelling offering for SAN
148,The converged infrastructure portfolio is really strong and expanding with both Fujitsu and the hyper-converged
149,And our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions continues to expand with the hyperscalers
150,So we feel very good about our position in the market and we're going to double down on it
151,"It's always competitive, Sherri"
152,I think every transaction is competitive
153,"I think we have a differentiated software portfolio and a long-term strategy, as well as I do want to congratulate our field organization on sales discipline that allows us to apply pricing discipline selectively where we need it, right?"
154,But every transaction remains competitive
155,"We have a portfolio of both all-flash and hybrid flash solutions, and one of the things we have noticed is that some customers are choosing hybrid flash since the price increases in solid-state"
156,And so our unique approach where we have a single software architecture that can span both gives us a differentiated competitive position as well
157,And so we've been using that to be disciplined in the marketplace
158,"First of all, thanks for your question"
159,The percentage of our installed base that is on solid-state is just about 10% now
160,And so we have a long base of footprint to go upgrade
161,"And as you know, with our Clustered operating system, the process to upgrade our installed base to solid-state is pretty seamless"
162,You can move from disk to flash in a seamless mechanism
163,And so we have a good opportunity ahead of us as flash continues to become more and more affordable relative to disk
164,"With regard to hyper-converged, I think that that's an opportunity for net new customer acquisition, net new workload capture and primarily at the expense of direct-attached storage or alternate storage solution from our competitors, and so we do see hyper-converged being additive to our installed base"
165,"We are seeing that today in the use cases for hyper-converged as opposed to converged system like FlexPod, they are different"
166,So we think that that's adding an upside (48:34)
167,We'll tell you more as we get more into the hyper-converged market
168,"Thank you everyone, and thank you, Kris"
169,The transformation of NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth is on track and yielding positive results
170,Our Data Fabric strategy is clearly resonating with customers
171,"We are out executing and out innovating the competition as we help companies harness the power of the cloud, build next-generation data centers and modernize their existing infrastructure"
172,"In the second quarter, we introduced a number of industry-leading innovations that position us for continued growth and expand upon our leadership position"
173,I am more confident than ever in our future and look forward to talking with you again next quarter
