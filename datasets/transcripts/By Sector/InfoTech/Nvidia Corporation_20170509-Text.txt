Thanks, Shawn
We had a strong start to the year
Highlighting our record first quarter was a near tripling of data center revenue, reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence
Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from the year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion
Growth remained broad-based, with year-on-year gains in each of our four platforms, gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive
From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million
And we recognized the remaining $43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement
Let's start with our gaming platforms
Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 49% year on year
Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks
Our Tegra gaming platform also did extremely well
Demand remained healthy for our enthusiast class GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, introduced nearly a year ago
It was complemented this past quarter with the GTX 1080 Ti, which runs 35% faster and was launched at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco
The GTX 1080 Ti is designed to handle the demands of 4K gaming and high-end VR experiences
Typical of many supportive reviews, Ars Technica stated it is undoubtedly a fantastic piece of engineering, cool, quiet, and without rival
Those that demand the absolute very best in cutting-edge graphics need look no further
We also released the next generation of our TITAN-class product, the TITAN Xp, designed for enthusiasts and researchers who demand extreme performance
Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in e-sports
The newest title, Overwatch, added 30 million gamers in its first year
GeForce was the graphics platform of choice at all the top e-sports tournaments, including the finals of the big four international competitions
With apologies to the start of the baseball season, e-sports is now as popular among U.S
male millennials as America's favorite pastime
More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix, ESPN, and Hulu combined
GeForce sales remained underpinned by the steady stream of AAA titles coming onto market, which continued to push for more chip GPU performance
In the months ahead, we'll see a series of highly anticipated blockbuster titles
Among them are Destiny 2 coming to the PC for the first time, Star Wars Battlefront II, Shadow of War, and the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise, World War II
We are excited to be working within Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system
Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform
Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstations
We are seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions, driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs
Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S
Navy's most advanced ships
The Marines utilize VR to train air crew personnel
And IKEA is rolling out VR to many of its stores, helping consumers configure their kitchens from a huge array of options, which they can visualize in sharp detail
Next, data center, record revenue of $409 million was nearly triple that of a year ago
The 38% rise from Q4 marked its seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement
Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services, plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX-1 AI super-computer
AI has quickly emerged as the single most powerful force in technology, and at the center of AI are NVIDIA GPUs
All of the world's major Internet and cloud service providers now use NVIDIA Tesla-based GPU accelerators, AWS, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft as well as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent
We also announced that Microsoft is bringing NVIDIA Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs to its Azure cloud
Organizations are increasingly building out AI-enabled applications using training clusters, evident in part by growing demand for DGX-1. We are seeing a number of significant deals
Among them are Fujitsu's installment of 24 systems integrated into an AI supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest research center, as well as new supercomputers at Oxford University, GE, and Audi
Working with Facebook, we announced the launch of the Caffe2 deep learning framework as well as Big Basin servers with Tesla P100 GPUs
To help meet huge demand for expertise in the field of AI, we announced earlier today plans to train 100 people this year through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, representing a 10x increase from last year
Through onsite training, public events, and online courses, DLI provides practical training on the tools of AI to developers, data scientists, and researchers
Our HPC business doubled year on year, driven by the adoption of Tesla GPUs into supercomputing centers worldwide
The use of AI and accelerated computing in HPC is driving additional demand in governance intelligence, higher education research, and finance
Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education, and automotive
Intuit's latest TurboTax release deploys GRID to connect tax filers seeking real-time advice with CPAs
And Honda is using GRID to bring together engineering and design teams based in different countries
Finally, automotive, revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules
We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problems of autonomous driving
Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just one year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations, and startups have begun developing with it
That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform's enhanced processing power and the introduction of Tensor RT for its in-vehicle AI inferencing
This quarter, we announced two important partnerships
Bosch, the world's largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world's carmakers, is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform
And PACCAR, one of the largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF
We continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving
The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns, and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone
We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks, and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018. Now turning to the rest of the Q1 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue
Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative
GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago
For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million
Non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion
For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends
In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%
Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points
These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million
GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes
Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website
Finally, this week we are sponsoring our annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley
Reflecting the surging importance of accelerating computing, GTC has grown to more than 7,000 attendees from 60 countries, up from 1,000 when we started eight years ago
Among its highlights, Jen-Hsun will deliver a news-filled keynote tomorrow morning
We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI
Developers will have access to 70 labs and workshops to learn about deep learning and GPU computing
And we will award a total of $1.5 million to the six most promising companies among the 1,300 in our Inception program for AI startups
We will be hosting our annual Investor Day tomorrow and hope to see many of you there
We will now open the call for questions
Please limit your questions to two
Operator, will you please poll for the questions? Question-and-Answer Session
Thanks for the question
We feel good about the guidance that we're providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure that it was understood the impact of Intel that's incorporated in there
It's still too early, given that it's – to say about the same size of what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up
But again, we do believe data center is a super-great opportunity for us
I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow
But we don't have any more additional details on our guidance, but we feel good about the guidance that we gave
