56,PayPal has the unique distinction in the corresponding benefit of having a deep and trusted relationship with almost 200 million merchants and consumer accounts through our two sided network
57,This means we can deliver new payment experiences like One Touch for the speed and impact that there is truly differentiated

71,"Last year, highlighted our commitment to putting our customer’s front and centre"
72,That led to our decision to offer greater customer choice in our payments experiences
73,This in turn has a recast to competitive landscape for PayPal and enables landmark partnerships and alliances that continue to expand and extend our opportunity for growth
74,"These partnerships are focused on giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to use PayPal anywhere they want, in stores, in apps, online and a new context for the consistent, convenient, and secure experience, following the announcements of our strategic partnership with Visa on our Q2 earnings call and MasterCard in Q3."

77,This is just the beginning
78,As our conversation with almost all leading financial service players are warm and welcoming
79,"Earlier this month, we announced the strategic agreement with Discover Financial Services"
80,This partnership allows the PayPal wallet to be closely linked and Discover cardholders acquires and merchants
81,"It will allow PayPal credit customers who link their discover cards to purchase online, in-app and in-store at contact listed enable merchants in the US"

97,We are inspired and focused on the opportunities in front of us and we look forward to providing ever more value to our customers and our shareholders
98,Before I conclude my remarks
99,I’d like to just take this opportunity to publicly welcome the newest member of PayPal
100,’s
101,Board Belinda Johnson
102,Belinda has filled an impressive track record at Airbnb
103,She has been a key architect in their growth and has held to chart new business approaches and innovative customer experiences
104,She’s already proving to be a great addition to our board
105,and we look forward to her valuable contributions
106,"And with that, let me hand it over to John"
107,You're talking about the increase in our revenue guidance?
108,"So, we are taking off our revenue guidance on an FX neutral basis and the reason we are doing that is there is a tremendous amount of secular tailwinds that we are seeing right now"
109,"As I mentioned in my remarks, seeing money digitizing is a big move to mobile, it is a big move to really online being sort of online payments and then pick up in stores or commerce is really just becoming commerce"
110,"I mean a great example of that is this was the best retail holiday season in five years,"
111,"but you saw - in-store sales actually drop and online move up to almost 17%, 18% or so"
112,"And so as we look at these secular tailwinds behind us, we look at the performance of things like One Touch and its clear advantage that we have now in mobile and the scale"
113,we have the increased engagement we are seeing
114,New market opportunities frankly internationally that we are beginning to see and have a platform now that we can extend to many more markets of Venmo
115,We see the beginning of monetization as we come into this year
116,"And we are seeing the back of the year, the beginnings of some in-store volumes based on tokenization and our partnerships with both the network and financial institutions"
117,"and then we've got a tremendous number of new partnerships, whether it be with Facebook, or Intuit or FI’s really around the world right now that is growing exponentially since we've announced our network agreement"
118,So there are a host of reasons right now that our confidence has improved in terms of our top line growth rate and by the way that’s also lacking 200 million of Xoom
119,"So think about that, as well as you think about kind of the revenue guidance we gave"
120,"So, we think they are good prospects ahead of us"
121,We are very focused on those opportunities and we are comfortable with that guidance
122,Bryan it
123,’s Dan
124,I’ll take the first part of that
125,and then I’ll wisely let John take the next part of it
126,"So, let me just back up a little bit, as you know and"
127,everyone on the call knows credit is and will continue to be an important flywheel for us
128,Credit gives flexible payment option to both our margins and to consumers
129,"It reduces card abandonment, it increases basket size for our merchants and consumers"
130,When somebody uses credit they do two times the spend on our PayPal network than somebody who doesn't
131,"When we do PayPal working capital on average those that we lend to, they see their sales go up 20% plus, and"
132,so it’s a tremendous flywheel for us
133,It is a small part of a business and it’s likely to remain so as well
134,"We don't need to chase growth here, we can be very responsible and who we lend to and how much we lend to them"
135,And we have great amounts of data and
136,really I think world class modeling around this
137,"That said that is no reason really to use our balance sheet or the receivables and there are, as we've mentioned before,"
138,a lot of benefits of asset right
139,"Obviously, we tie up a lot of our free cash flow in the receivables with free cash flow, for other capital allocation that we might do, we have reduced exposure, we still have a differentiated proposition that we would use our data and our modeling with our partner to bring back a differentiated proposition into our phase and there are very attractive economics to share"
140,"And as we've seen right now, from people who are very interested in partnering with us, our portfolio is very effective"
141,"The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share"
142,"and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business"
143,That is a working hypothesis as we are going through this
144,"We are in the early process of looking through this right now because it is a very competitive process out there as people look to potentially partner with us, you know we look to make a decision as we digest and sort through all the different proposals that we’re seeing, that said very much likely to be a - if we go and how we do this exactly with the back half of 2017 event, but clearly there is a lot of demand"
145,", there is a lot of benefits for us moving towards asset light"
146,and we think as I mentioned you reduce risk and maintain strong economics for the business
147,Let me try and jump the two questions in there
148,So let me start with the mobile
149,and then I will go into the impact of some regulatory and change of administrations
150,"Mobile, mobile is driving growth in the industry right now"
151,I mean more half the sales that are going online are being driven by mobile
152,"Mobile is blurring lines of distinction between in-store environment and online environments, where like commerce is just becoming commerce"
153,"And truthfully, mobile is the biggest competitive differentiator for us"
154,"If we think about mobile, the real problem that merchants have with mobile is that when a browser begins the shopping experience on mobile between 65% and 74% of the time there is card abandonment because it’s such a small screen, it’s difficult to put of the payment information in there et cetera"
155,So with One Touch we have 87% conversion on mobile
156,87%
157,"The next closest is 51%, the industry average is like 44%"
158,"So, we are at almost double the industry average in terms of the mobile experience that we see and mobile is exploring across the world, as well as I mentioned in terms of why did we take up our revenue guidance, pick it up because we see opportunity across the world and that’s predominantly driven by mobile"
159,"So, I had spent mobile to continue to fewer our growth"
160,"Remember one other thing I said in my remarks with over half of our active basis on mobile payment transaction is through the PayPal platform in the last 12 months, over 100 billion in the volume of 55% for the year"
161,"So expect that to, not particular what the growth rate will be one way or the other, but mobile is going to be a strong driver of growth"
162,and it’s
163,a big differentiator for us
164,"No, I was thinking in, see if I can [indiscernible]"
165,I will start of a little bit and then you can jump in
166,"So, like I say in terms of Venmo monetization pricing very little actually built into our guidance for 2017."
167,"We fully intend to rollout out Venmo, previous Venmo in a much broader basis in 2017."
168,"And we will see some impact in that, but really the big impact on that happens in 2018 and 2019."
169,"And so just see that and that’s, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond it’s because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now"
170,"and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but let’s model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere"
171,and so not much is built into that
172,"Not as much built into the customer choice piece of it, although I will say we’re pretty encouraged by the initial results that we’re seeing on choice"
173,"We rolled that choice through all of North America, right now on the servicing piece of choice, as well as the on boarding of that, we are just beginning in checkout right now, but as John mentioned in his remarks from a cost perspective it is well within our expectations in terms of transaction expense and engagement"
174,", it is better than we expected in terms of engagement which by the way is not really surprising"
175,"If you give somebody the choice to pay, they become more engaged, the average price that they pay or the basket size that they have goes up, as well these are not surprising"
176,"We anticipated, but it’s nice to see those things starting to really happen in the market, but we have a ton of that built into our guidance as well that to me is more of a 2018, 2019 phenomenon"
177,It's Dan
178,I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call
179,We know how busy all of you are
180,and we look forward to seeing you at our investor conferences and talking to you on our next earnings call as well
181,"So, thank you very much for your time"
