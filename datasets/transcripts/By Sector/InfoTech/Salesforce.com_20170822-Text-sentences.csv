0,"Thank you so much, John"
1,I really appreciate it
2,"And before I begin the script and talking about our quarter, I really wanted to review something that I sent to the Company last week, regarding some of the things that we’ve been seeing in the world"
3,And I thought it would be appropriate if we just took one minute and just allowed you to hear these words as well
4,As the world has watched with all of us the horrors of the last week taking place in the United States and Spain
5,The pure hatred that we have seen displayed is everything we all want to end
6,And I’ve been especially disheartened to see the display of symbols of hatred including Nazi flags and salutes to KKK hoods
7,The horrible tragic death of Heather Heyer was a senseless act of terror and this hatred must end now
8,"Salesforce is a company that is built on the values of love, equality and generosity"
9,We work hard every day to improve the state of the world through our own work and promote our Company’s mission to others
10,We all have to recommit to our own personal acts of love and kindness as this is the only way to fight this pure hatred
11,"We can all make our own choices between love and hate, and we can all love more"
12,"Now is the time for all of us to remember, love thy neighbor as thyself"
13,Thank you very much for allowing me to say that
14,"And now, I’d like to move into the quarter"
15,We had our best quarter ever and we reached a huge milestone for the company
16,"As you might remember, two and a half years ago, I talked about our dream of surpassing $10 billion in revenue"
17,"And at that time, we were just on a $5 billion revenue run rate"
18,While I can remember how many employees and customers and partners came up to me and said there is no way you are going to get to $10 billion
19,What kind of a dream is this?
20,"And now, I am absolutely thrilled that in the second quarter we broke through the $10 billion run rate, doubling the Company in such a short time"
21,"Now, Salesforce is the first enterprise cloud software company in the history of the industry to reach the $10 billion run rate"
22,"No competitor has pierced $10 billion this fast, not Oracle, not Microsoft, not SAP and certainly not which has $15 billion of deferred revenue on and off the balance sheet"
23,This makes Salesforce the fastest growing enterprise software company ever to reach this milestone
24,And this incredible achievement is now coupled with an incredible dream
25,We now set our sights on $20 billion and doubling the Company again
26,"And you can see today how we can get there organically with our unmatched product portfolio, world-class team, and as I mentioned $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet"
27,"While this was a phenomenal quarter of growth, we continue to improve our profitability, executing at scale"
28,and we remain the fastest-growing of all the top five enterprise software companies
29,"Now, let’s talk about some of the highlights of the quarter"
30,"Revenue for the quarter rose to almost $2.6 billion, which was up 26%, and we are heading fast to $20 billion in revenue"
31,"As I mentioned, we have more than $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, that’s up 29% from a year ago"
32,"In fact, we added more than $3 billion to this balance since last year"
33,"Based on these strong results, we are raising full year top-line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.4 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth for this dream, and I will tell you personally"
34,", I’ve got dreams of 25%"
35,This is the second quarter in a row we have raised our revenue guide by a $100 million and only the third time in our history
36,"Now, there is a reason for our incredible success year-after-year and why we continue to be investing at such an incredible rate to be the number one CRM company, is because no other company like ours has ever been as committed to customer success as Salesforce, and that’s reflected in how our customers are driving tremendous success for their customers"
37,"You all know that customer relationship management, whether it’s B2B or B2C, has already become the most important and fastest-growing enterprise software category, growing at nearly 14%, and that’s going to come for years to come"
38,"Well, it’s a massive $100 billion plus opportunity that Salesforce is leading, and we are in a phenomenal position going forward"
39,We all see the $1 trillion CRM opportunity in front of us
40,"Now, we see that by our -- through our number one position and that’s because we are number one in CRM, number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, and we have the number one platform that we have a tremendous opportunity to deliver on these goals"
41,"And we are delivering this at a scale every single day, creating nearly 3 million sales opportunities, more than 5 million customer cases sending 1.4 billion emails, processing 1 million purchases, and producing 40 million reports and dashboards every single day, that’s 1 billion reports and dashboards a month, by the way, all while delivering more than 5 billion platform transactions a day"
42,And it’s no wonder that Forbes just named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again
43,"We were the first to bring innovations like cloud and social and mobile to CRM, and now we’re the first to deliver artificial intelligence to all of our customers with Einstein, right inside our core platform across all of our products"
44,This is a massive $1 trillion growth opportunity
45,"According to IDC, the combination of CRM and IA - excuse me, according to IDC, the combination of CRM and AI will create more than $1 trillion in new GDP impact worldwide; 800,000 net new jobs by 2021, amazing"
46,"And we’re already seeing how Einstein is a game changer for customers, delivering hundreds of millions of critical insights, recommendations and predictions every single day"
47,"But, our biggest advantage is more than 27,000 talented employees of Salesforce, these incredible people who are focused on making our customers successful with our products"
48,No other company can match this level of focus on the CRM market
49,"All of this adds up to Salesforce, becoming increasingly strategic to our customers and to our partners who are trusting us to bring them into this incredible new future"
50,You’ll hear more about that in a second from Keith
51,"While it’s only August, we’re officially on the road to Dreamforce, which is going to take place in San Francisco, November 6th through 9th, and it’s going to be the most exciting, most inspirational and most innovative Dreamforce ever"
52,And I hope all of you can be there; you’re not going to want to miss one moment
53,"Okay, Keith"
54,Thank you very much for asking that question
55,"I think that when we think about earnings, and obviously we have this incredible top line growth, and there is one word that really comes to mind and that’s balance, which is that it’s incredibly important as we grow our company and exceed these incredible revenue targets that we also continue to grow our bottom-line"
56,And I am sure that Mark will address the specifics of how much we’ve grown our bottom line in the last few years
57,"But one of the things that continues to be on our minds is, how -- what are the ways that we can grow our margin while also continuing to grow our top line, and"
58,we’re absolutely committed to doing both
59,And I think that’s on the mind of every single member of our management team
60,I think we’ve continued to deliver those numbers actually very well
61,and we’ll continue to do that going forward
62,"And that’s also under the guise of pressure that we get from foreign exchange, like every time the euro increases, its valuation that puts more pressure on our bottom-line"
63,"Mark, do you want to address?"
64,I’d like to think of this investing in growth by design and enhancing our profitability every step of the way
65,"Well, let me take the last question first, which is that Salesforce actually gets its data from a lot of different places"
66,"More than half of the transactions, when we talk about 5 billion transactions a day, more than half of those transactions are API transactions already, that’s other computers filling our database with data"
67,And we have just amassed a huge amount of customer data based on that
68,We have so many integrations and so many customers so deeply integrated
69,And then there is many different ways that customers get their information into our system
70,"Of course, we have many natural language type systems like one you mentioned, voice type systems like you"
71,"’ve seen us do work with Alexa, with Amazon"
72,and I think you will continue to see an evolution of that
73,One area that I am especially proud of is mobile
74,I don’t think any enterprise software company has done as good a job with mobile as Salesforce
75,"Salesforce has -- with Salesforce1, with My Salesforce1, Salesforce Inbox, many of our mobile offerings and mobile platform capabilities, more mobile capability than any other enterprise software company"
76,And that has really allowed customers to access and work with an input data in lots of new ways
77,"Because mobile devices are empowered and enabled to so many kind of, I would say, next generation capabilities including many operating systems that have very deep AI, as you know, all of that is already tied into Salesforce"
78,"So, it’s a very extremely powerful"
79,"I think that number one for us, here we are, we’re blasting through $10 billion, all of you have your models for Salesforce, you can plug these preferred revenue numbers into your models and do your calculations of where our revenues going to be in each of the next several years"
80,"And I’ll tell you, we took our whole management team"
81,offsite two weeks ago to lay out our plan for what we call chapter three
82,"Chapter one for us certainly was zero to $1 billion, it’s well documented in the book Behind the Cloud"
83,", how we did it, what we did, all of those capabilities"
84,We want to write a second book now for entrepreneurs of what we did from $1 billion to $10 billion
85,We think that’s an important story that needs to be told
86,That’s certainly chapter two
87,"Now, we’re in chapter three, which is to go from $10 to $20 billion"
88,And I’m sure all of you can see that’s going to happen in fairly short order
89,I think that one of the things that we have done to focus on and make sure that we blast through $10 billion is to focus on customer success
90,I think a lot of mistakes that the other entrepreneurs have made and I can go through each one
91,"In enterprise software specifically, it’s not to really double down at this point, again on the customer"
92,"Get absorbed in your own myopia, get absorbed in your corporate politics, get absorbed in your corporate bureaucracies and yourselves, and try to break out of yourself and recognize the most important thing, continues to be the customer"
93,"And how do we enable that customer and empower that customer and of course, we’re going hold ourselves accountable and we’re also going to deliver all kinds of other capabilities along the way as well"
94,"But, that is really our focus, which is how do we make our customers more successful than ever"
95,And I think that’s the heart of our culture
96,"We have a great culture at Salesforce, it’s a culture built on our core values of trust, of growth, of innovation, of quality"
97,But I think nothing is more important to our Company than customer success
98,"And even though the vast majority, let’s say half of the 27,000 employees that work for us today probably were not with us two years ago"
99,So that is something that we really have to spend time with them at
100,We’re different than other software companies because we really care about that customer and we’re going to make sure that customer is successful
101,"When you’re an enterprise software, you have to realize, it’s"
102,"hard work, not everything is going to be perfect all the time, there is going to be problems"
103,That’s why being so committed to the customer
104,I think is more important than ever
105,"And I think that’s why you’re going to see extraordinary growth for years to come, because of this culture that’s really driving it forward"
106,And then we coupled it with this incredible CRM opportunity
107,And I have to say our competitors have really done a horrible job in last few years
108,I just would say that a lot of them have abandoned the CRM market
109,"If you talk to the major CRM analysts and we do that, we just had one of them at our management conference, they are shocked,"
110,we’re shocked of how these companies have really walked out of the CRM market
111,", companies that had huge multibillion dollar positions in the CRM have ceded that market to us"
112,"And that’s very exciting when you look at the huge investments that we’ve made, not just in product but also distribution"
113,More than half of our organization is a customer-facing organization
114,We sell directly and service directly to the customer
115,That is going to serve us very well for years to come
116,"So, I feel very good"
117,and I think you can see it in the numbers here
118,"As I said, we’re here forecasting 24% growth for the year that’s our official guidance"
119,I have personal dreams of 25%
120,I think that would be amazing
121,No software company kind went through the $10.4 billion number at these rates
122,"And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsoft’s growth over 30 years, Salesforce’s growth, Oracle’s growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories"
123,And I feel that that’s going to continue to happen
124,"Well, the platform strategy has evolved over time"
125,"I mean, one of the cool things for us is we have a tremendous capability with our platform"
126,And that really started with this idea that we are building these amazing CRM apps like sales and service app but our customers wanted apps really designed for them
127,"The traditional approach has been companies building vertical apps, almost from the get-go and creating these customizations and enhancements right inside the hard line code"
128,"That never sat well with me, mostly because my background was in application development and deployment tools"
129,"So, we really built our platform in a way that let us build our core applications and let our customers extend them"
130,And that is why so much amount of data has been built inside of Salesforce
131,I don’t think a single customer has the same implementation of Salesforce
132,"And yet when we upgrade and update our software which we do three times a year, we don’t break links and we don’t break these customizations, and customers get Einstein and mobile and all of our enhancements and"
133,"yet they have their highly customized capability, no other company in the world has that"
134,"Even today when most companies upgrade and update their core applications even in the cloud, they don’t upgrade all customers democratically, they kind of give customers warning bells that we are going to do this"
135,but it’s going to break your system
136,We don’t do that
137,We have a way through our metadata architecture to really extend that
138,"And then, as we have acquired companies, we have brought that platform religion to them"
139,"So, when we look at all of our core products, they all have core platforms"
140,Platforms are incredibly important because they let customers enhance their system in highly specialized way
141,Platforms are also extremely important because they drive down attrition
142,"I think as we -- we just ran our numbers for this management conference that I mentioned,"
143,"two weeks ago, if you look at our attrition rate over the last 10 years, one of the reasons we drive it down is because of our platform"
144,"I think one of the reasons we have been able to deliver so quickly this amazing work and financial services that Keith has led, which is the building of our financial services cloud and our financial services business unit is -- and our success in financial services is because of our platform, rapidly"
145,"When we figure out a market or capability that we want to have or focus on, we can rapidly deliver that"
146,That’s also true with Keith
147,’s healthcare initiative as well
148,And that I think has been a very powerful part of our approach
149,"Our platform is unique, because not only of course do we have our core platform, which includes our Sales Cloud platform and our Service Cloud platform and our Marketing Cloud platform"
150,"but we also have extensions of that platform like Heroku, which is one of the most powerful and popular application development and deployment capabilities on Amazon"
151,And we of course have tightly integrated that into our core platform
152,"So, customers for example, I’m wearing this amazing new Louis Vuitton watch today"
153,"And this Louis Vuitton watch is connected to something called LV Pass, which is the Louis Vuitton app that helps me manage all of my Louis Vuitton products"
154,And that is built on Heroku
155,"And then all of the CRM data for Louis Vuitton however is built and managed inside our core platform, and all of it is deeply integrated"
156,"So, when I walk into a Louis Vuitton store, they know who I am, they know all the products that I bought like the watch, or my carryall or whatever it is that I like of their products, and I am managing it all through that Heroku app on my phone with all LV Pass"
157,That’s a great example of our platform strategy where we let customers build highly complex applications like Louis Vuitton with their icon app and
158,you can see that inside any Louis Vuitton store when you go into work with a Louis Vuitton account executive and you can see it yourself as a consumer with Heroku when you use LV Pass on your phone
159,I hope that answers your question
160,"I mean, I think Einstein has hugely exceeded our expectations"
161,"And I would say from my perspective, it’s already material part of our results"
162,"I think it’s a critical part of how we differentiate our product against now all of our competitors because we’re the first company to take the robust AI capabilities including machine intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, and offer that to our customers in a unified CRM platform through our sales, service, marketing applications, commerce applications across the board"
163,"That has really happened faster than we expected, more deeply than we’ve expected, and it’s been more exciting for our customers than we expected"
164,"I think also, the branding choice that we made with Einstein also exceeded our expectations because it let us rapidly communicate to our customers that we’ve extended our core platform with artificial intelligence"
165,As we kind of head towards Dreamforce
166,", you’re going to see a lot of exciting things"
167,"With AI, I have seen some amazing things"
168,"In financial services, I just saw some amazing things in healthcare; I am not going to go into the details on the call because some of the results are still early"
169,"But, we’ve seen some amazing breakthroughs in using artificial intelligence with healthcare"
170,I think this is going to be one of the huge new drivers of growth
171,"You can see that the cloud is a huge driver of growth for Salesforce, mobile is a huge driver of growth for Salesforce, and now you’ve got AI as this next generation system"
172,And every company has to look at what are they using -- what are they doing with AI to make their customer relationship better
173,I just gave you the story about Louis Vuitton
174,Einstein is built into all of those apps
175,And I can tell you that helps that Louis Vuitton account executive when I walk in the store; they are able to give me that next best offer
176,I think it’s
177,"probably one of the reasons that we already closed at Kering Group in this quarter, another incredible luxury brand family with Gucci and Bottega Veneta because we’re able to offer these companies the ability to have much better, much smarter relationships and do it so unbelievably quickly"
178,"I also just bought some amazing new sneakers on Adidas and called Primeknit Shoes, checked out some of the stuff they have or some of the stands that tennis shoes or other Yeezy 350s that they have on the Adidas and a lot of the recommendations and capabilities that you are getting already on the platform are through Einstein"
179,"So, Einstein is an incredible advancement and"
180,it’s great for all of our clouds
181,"And again, I don’t think the other enterprise software companies that moved fast enough into artificial intelligence"
182,Let me jump in and then maybe Keith or Mark might want to add on the first one
183,and I will close loop on the second one on the 18% and 19%
184,"You are absolutely right, Karl"
185,"The unbilled deferred revenue at 30% is a slight acceleration and a very, very big number in terms of growth"
186,"We have -- I think it’s really reflective of a strong business that we’ve been describing, that Keith has been describing in his dialogue, a large sort of deals over a long time but just overall health, across geos, [ph] across clouds"
187,"Keith, if you want to jump more into that, but I think the 30% is a slight acceleration"
188,Karl’s absolutely right
189,"If you want to add any more commentary, I will circle back to 18% and 19% DR"
190,"And let me just pick up the second point, Karl"
191,"In terms of the DR of 18% to 19%, this is really about the deepening invoice seasonality, it just continues"
192,"And one of the things that I would call out to everyone and I think just to share with you is that we have 12 years of history on our webpage, our IR webpage with supplemental information that shows every quarter for 12 years and the sequential impact because this has been a topic we’ve been trying to share at Dreamforces for the past several years"
193,"But you can actually see the math and even fit in the guide for this quarter, and it really shows us deepening invoice seasonality continues"
194,And the other thing that I would add and
195,"I do think there is one little extra bit of color that I would like to add, Karl, which is look at that trending just as it is"
196,"and then you take a look at the fact that last year in Q2 2017, we had a seasonally soft Q2 2017 and we had a seasonally strong Q3 2017."
197,"And so, you put that"
198,and you look at that results delivered at minus 9% quarter-on-quarter
199,and you’ll see it perfectly on the graph
200,"but then you put it in juxtaposition to this year in Q3 2018, we have a -- obviously we’re appropriately guided and we had a very strong Q2."
201,"So, those are the things to think about as well the bottom line and that’s where we’re at, that’s what you should consider"
202,"First of all, I think you can see this great win with the Veteran’s administration"
203,this quarter is an indication of the government vertical is working better than we expected
204,"We’ve organized by specialized verticals, one I mentioned was financial services and built products there"
205,"We’ve also organized by healthcare, we’ve also built products there"
206,Third one is government and we built products there
207,"And I think our win with the veterans this quarter, I think all of us know that nobody delivers better systems and better customer service than our veterans, and that’s why we’re so excited to be able to align with the agency to go to build these next generation systems for them"
208,"And I think we started to see government spending come back on line this quarter, really for the first time"
209,"And so, we’re very excited about what the future could mean, as the government looks to kind build next generation systems, looks to move to the cloud and provide better service and support to its customers"
210,"And as you mentioned, IBM, we continue to get more and more integrations with IBM"
211,We’ve had some great early successes with Watson
212,And our opportunities are to work with all of these amazing companies to deliver a solution that serves our customers
213,And I think we’ve been probably done a better job I think in forming the strategic alliances and maintaining them than probably any other company in the industry
214,And I think it’s one of the reasons we had such a great quarter
215,"Well anyway, thank you everyone for a great call"
216,"And we couldn’t be more excited, as I said"
217,I think this is probably our best quarter ever
218,It’s far exceeded our expectations
219,"We’re thrilled to raise guidance for the year and set our next dream as $20 billion, and here we go"
