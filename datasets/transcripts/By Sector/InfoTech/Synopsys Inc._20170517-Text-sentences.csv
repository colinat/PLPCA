0,Good afternoon
1,I'm happy to report that our second quarter results were strong
2,"We delivered revenue of $680 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.88, both at the top of our target ranges"
3,We executed $100 million share buyback for a total of $200 million so far this year
4,"And we-re raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year"
5,Trac will discuss the financials in more detail
6,The landscape around us is solid with what feels like a continuing stable outlook for 2017.
7,"Our 3 customer groups, semiconductors, systems companies and software developers, continue to invest significantly"
8,This is driven by the dawning age of digital intelligence which is both exciting and evolving quickly
9,"Everything around us is becoming smart, connected but also complex"
10,"Mounting software content, whether integrated on a chip or as an app, creates huge functionality, development and security challenges"
11,"This, in turn, drives growth opportunities around machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure and the soaring need for more cloud-based computation and storage"
12,"With the unique portfolio reaching from the roots of silicon all the way up to software, combined with best-in-class global support, Synopsys continues to demonstrate that our vision, strategy, investments and execution are right on the money"
13,This is evidenced in all 3 product groups
14,Core EDA revenue growth has outpaced competitors over the past years
15,IP continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion
16,Let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with core EDA
17,Synopsys is a mission-critical partner for the most advanced designs
18,Our EDA and IP collaboration with TSMC illustrates this
19,"During Q2, we announced full flow certification for TSMC's 12- and 7-nanometer processes as well as broad IP cooperation for 12-nanometer FinFETs"
20,Customers today rely on Synopsys for more than 95% of their FinFET designs
21,"Meanwhile, we-re already partnering on early R&D of 5-nanometer and below"
22,Our design platform is generating solid results and notable customer successes
23,"IC Compiler II, our place and route solution, is used on highly complex chips, some as advanced as 7-nanometer, by companies such as Xilinx, NVIDIA, ST and Broadcom"
24,"IC Validator, our physical verification product, has already performed final sign-off of more than 100 FinFET production tape-outs, a significant accomplishment given the historical reliance on competitors"
25,"Meanwhile, intensive R&D across our digital platform is delivering new high-impact capabilities at a very rapid pace"
26,"In custom, our long-time leadership in simulation and our new Custom Compiler design solution are generating high interest"
27,"Custom Compiler's FinFET optimizations and our close collaboration with UMC, for example, enabled customers to use Custom Compiler in their new 14-nanometer process"
28,"At our March user group conference, ST, MediaTek and Renesas shared their production successes with engineers from more than 40 companies"
29,"In verification, we continued to see excellent results and a strong outlook for the year"
30,"Our Verification Continuum platform is in high demand for 2 reasons, first, we have leading-edge verification technologies ranging from simulation to emulation to prototyping to static techniques to powerful, well integrated debugging; and second, our coherent platform is solidly centered at the intersection of hardware and software, the very intersection enabling Smart Everything and addressing the time-to-market urgency of this dynamic market"
31,We continue to see great progress ranging from excellent customer interest in our new superfast VCS simulator to platform-wide adoption and proliferation
32,"Over the last several quarters, leading mobile, graphics and processor companies have aligned with us through expanded multi-year strategy -- strategic agreements, including simulation, verification IP, debug, formal, emulation and prototyping technologies"
33,"In Q2, broad demand for ZeBu emulation continued with 6 new logos and expansion in top accounts"
34,"For example, Spreadtrum standardized on ZeBu for its advanced mobile SoCs and Wave Computing adopted ZeBu for its machine learning products"
35,"While lumpy from quarter-to quarter, we expect 2017 to be another record year for hardware revenue, driven by industry demand and the robustness of our solution"
36,"On top of this, virtual prototyping which enables early software development and architecture assessment, resonated particularly well in the automotive market"
37,"During the quarter, we announced support for chips from Silicon Mobility Inc"
38,", a leading semiconductor provider for hybrid and electric vehicle control systems"
39,"Let me pause for a moment on automotive, where, over the past several years, we've deployed a wide range of targeted solutions"
40,"With touch points ranging from functional safety to autonomous driving to the next-generation of infotainment, all the way to lighting simulation, Synopsys is growing into a crucial participant in the automotive ecosystem"
41,"Elements throughout our EDA, IP and software integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety defined by the ISO 26262 standard"
42,"In IP, for example, over the last 8 quarters, we significantly extended our portfolio of certified IP"
43,"More broadly, in Q2, we saw strong demand in IP with particular momentum in advanced technology and security"
44,We announced an expansive portfolio of IP for TSMC's 12 FFC process and taped out multiple 10- and 7-nanometer IP test chips with advanced foundries
45,"We're systematically building out our portfolio of security IP for mobile, automotive, IoT and cloud computing markets"
46,"In Q2, for example, we delivered a high-performance, hardware-secure module that protects sensitive information and data processing within SoCs"
47,"The need for security is, of course, much broader than IP which brings me to our third customer base, software developers across many industries"
48,The focus in our growing Software Integrity Group is to provide products and services that help developers write high-quality code that can withstand security vulnerabilities
49,This as a key differentiator and new TAM for Synopsys
50,and I'm happy to report that it's scaling well both organically and via acquisitions
51,Our software sign-off platform is making good progress and we have expanded our road map to reflect the acquisition of Cigital
52,We're strong in the embedded space with growing transaction sizes and are gaining good traction in the automotive industry with our security solutions and well-respected expertise
53,"With the acquisition of Cigital in Q1, we're accelerating penetration in other key verticals such as the financial services industry"
54,Our objective is to drive demand creation at early stages of security strategy development
55,The Cigital integration is already delivering examples of our first combined services and product agreements and cross-selling opportunities
56,"Finally, Synopsys was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for application security testing"
57,The Magic Quadrant is an important indicator for customers who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors
58,We've already seen increased customer interest as a result
59,"In closing, as we look to the second half of the year and beyond, our priorities remain centered on generating long term shareholder value"
60,"We do this by investing organically and through M&A and EDA, IP and software integrity to realize our Silicon to Software vision"
61,We do this by executing with a clear intent to sustain technology leadership while simultaneously growing revenue and profitability throughout our business
62,"And we do this with a clear bottom line objective and many year track record, of driving ongoing high single-digit EPS growth and returning cash to shareholders"
63,Let me now turn the call over to Trac
64,"Well, in general, I think we're in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and"
65,"when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas, we always look at it from a perspective of a multi-year outlook because that's sort of the only fair way to do it, all the more given that we have a multi-year agreement"
66,"Having said that, there's no question that the push towards more advanced chips is actually continuing strong and"
67,"I think the reason for that is relatively straightforward which is that the new opportunities in technologies and products are using any of the existing computation and mobility techniques but now amended by increased digital intelligence requirements, will continue to be very strong after that enormous amounts of data generated by a happily growing set of sensors"
68,And you can see that the entire field is really poised to demand more computation
69,"And so it is natural, therefore, for people to come to our products"
70,"And while there are some up and down from quarter-to quarter, they are driving the leading edge and they need the tools to support that"
71,So I think we're fortunate to do well
72,It feels like repetitive in the last 3 or 4 earnings releases
73,"We must have used the word hardware is lumpy every time and that is an indication that the visibility is not complete, meaning that some of these things come in and then the customer wants immediate fulfillment or delayed fulfillment"
74,So the timing can be somewhat arbitrary
75,There's no question that we have done well in the hardware area
76,and I think that correlate directly to what we said earlier which is growth in complexity of chips but also more and more chips and the affiliated software needing to be verified together
77,And that is only a center of strength for Synopsys
78,"Actually, the first two groups because in order for emulation and other hardware isolation methods to be useful, it is really in the proximity of the intersection of hardware and software which means it's the high-end chips that invariably drive a lot of software or it is the systems companies that integrate multiple chips around building apps or building entire product"
79,"And so the distinction between semiconductor vendors and system vendors sometimes is a little blurred because they tend to increasingly do stuff for each other or demand from each other that, that sits at this intersection"
80,"So both of those, I think, sort of grow hand in hand"
81,"Actually, sorry I forgot that part of your question"
82,IP is directly related to efficiency and productivity
83,"And with continuous complexity of chips and by the way, continued complexity of the IP blocks, delayed collection of these blocks just continues to grow and the efficiency with which people can put together large chips is directly a function of which blocks are available"
84,", how easy is it to integrate them and how much do you trust the vendor because, obviously, you're highly relying on who provides you those blocks"
85,"And so as companies design large chips or larger systems, increasingly, they put their engineers on those aspects that they can't purchase but where they can provide additional differentiation while outsourcing increasingly blocks that, in the past, they would have done themselves"
86,And I think that bodes very well for us
87,I have not seen any seasonality
88,I think it is very much project based
89,"and it has always a little bit the characteristic that the minute they figure out what's going to be in the project, they would like to have the IP the next day which, of course, not possible because a lot of this gets developed as part of agreements and service development sets"
90,But the projects come and go
91,The companies have no aligned time line for these projects and so I don't see any seasonality
92,"But one could have the configuration that, for some reason, there are some quarter, there are more project finishing than others or deliveries that we could do"
93,"So it could be somewhat lumpy, but it's not because of seasonality"
94,They are completely ready for the 7-nanometer
95,5-nanometer is not on the market and 5-nanometer is still in deep development
96,That will take a little while
97,And even when I say for the 7-nanometer -- 7-nanometer is really leading edge and
98,"what that means is that the foundries that provide the technology and that manufacture these chips will keep refining their technology on ongoing basis because they constantly are trying to tune the yields that they get because if you have a little higher yields, meaning a higher percentage of chips that work on a wafer, that has enormous economic impact"
99,And so we-re in constant interaction with foundries
100,"Every time that they tune it a little bit, we tune our tools and in some cases, we also tune our IP a little further"
101,"Yes, we have a number of efforts in these advanced nodes and"
102,"the word ready is not a black and white, meaning that there are certain things that are already earlier"
103,"There are certain things that are already with 7-nanometers, not quite there, for test chips, for example"
104,And so there's a very complex multi-year process to bring something to market
105,"But from my commentary, you should read that we-re well exercised in trying to align as much as possible with the foundry train so that we arrive at the station at the same time"
106,It doesn't matter that much
107,There are some very fundamental IP that's impacted by EUV
108,"And as you may know, EUV is sort of now just slowly seeping into potentially some production manufacturing in the coming years and that is only for a few layers of the chip"
109,"And there are many, many layers, so EUV will be for the very refined ones initially"
110,"And so we're well on top of that, but it does not mean a big effort nor a big issue"
111,Yes
112,"Just to clarify, when we do IP, people buy existing functionality but very often wanted to be delivered in a very specific form, maybe with some alterations or with some tuning for their versions of technology"
113,And so this is why the IP is accompanied by a statement of work which can be viewed essentially as a service business
114,But it is service business around an existing product
115,And the reason you saw us hesitate is because we rarely think about it in those 2 categories
116,But it is a good question
117,It is sort of a balance between the 2.
118,"Yes, we have seen those since like the middle 1990s"
119,"We've been in China for a long, long time and they have been, for now many, many years, many design companies"
120,Many have not been successful
121,"And so I would say, we're at least already on the third or fourth generation of companies where a bunch have disappeared, reconfigured and so on"
122,"And now there is a significant segment of strong Chinese companies that are -- that have, year after year, become closer and closer to be at the state of the art"
123,and we would certainly say that there are a few companies that are designing with absolutely state-of-the-art silicon technology
124,And so they have been broad users of our tools
125,China has been a growing market for us and we continue to see expansion of that market
126,Definitely yes
127,"I mean, memory development is development that requires pretty deep understanding of semiconductor physics and device construction"
128,"And so with the number of companies we have now been working for a while on the development of those, you're absolutely right that, in the last recent period, I would say maybe last 2 years, there has been an increase in attention and effort"
129,"And that is the direct response to the fact that most economies are seeing an enormous amount of data coming about, that the big data will be analyzed and therefore, the -- be it in the cloud or be it the devices around it, are all going to use massively more memory and that their strong desire to make that memory a lot faster so that you can do more processing"
130,"And so in that sense, while China may be new to this game, the push in new memory technologies is quite interesting and that fits well the overall picture of a semiconductor business that is going to be an enabler to many other high-tech capabilities"
131,Good question
132,"I don't know the exact answer, but I can venture that it is probably half to a little bit more as outside"
133,And the reason for that is that the marketing needed in our core semiconductor space is not that high because we have many very good connections and we can relatively easily access people that need security and quality tools for their software
134,"Whereas in the rest of the space, there are many different market segments"
135,"And you mentioned Cigital which is a really interesting acquisition because it's not only that it brings to us a service business, that allows us to engage at a higher level with customers that are looking at the strategy of their -- of how to deal with quality and security"
136,It is that they're also very strong in the financial market
137,And so the way you communicate with financial market is very different than
138,", let's say, the health market or the embedded software market"
139,and that is why some marketing effort has to be specialized on that
140,"From a sales point of view, there, it is much more a question of global access and how quickly can we grow this and be in a situation where we have high-quality salespeople"
141,And that is an ongoing effort and going well
142,"We're growing well, but there's no end to that one yet"
143,"Well, so for being at Synopsys for 30 years, I would say our capacity has always been less than the customer wanted and more than they thought they would get, meaning that the state of the art is limited typically by a few things which is, one, is how fast can you run; and two,"
144,how much can you run at the same time
145,"And so it has been actually quite remarkable how, over all this time period, these numbers have continued to increase"
146,"And I'm certainly on record of having argued many times that we-re the other half of Moore's Law which is if they can manufacture it, we will find a way to simulate it, to design it and so on"
147,and that goes hand in hand
148,"But for the most state-of-the-art situations, one has always had the limit of what one can do"
149,"The second comment I would have for that, it is quite remarkable how, over all these years, over and over, there have been redesigns of architecture of utilization of compute environments, of utilization of multiple computers, multiple cores, multiple threads that have managed to keep your question in check"
150,So we're always chasing the horizon in other words and this is true on the hardware side in emulation or prototyping
151,It is certainly true for software for a long time
152,And expect that to absolutely continue and we will stay at the leading edge of that
153,"Secondly, regarding the intersection of prototyping and software integrity, I expect that we're going to start seeing some of that in the not-too-distant future"
154,"So far, there's not been a lot of evidence of that, but we have not really pushed on that front yet either"
155,"The intersection between prototyping of emulation, we have already seen quite a bit of that"
156,"And by the way, it's intersection of prototyping, emulation and simulation and in some cases, even virtual prototyping"
157,And that is because the system people would like to simulate software on larger systems that have many components that may be defined at different levels of abstraction
158,So all of this is being done
159,I don't want to give the impression that this is routinely easy
160,But we-re in a very strong position with this and the most advanced customers are very literate about this type of problems
161,We have very strong hardware business
162,"For starters, we're fortunate that our own processes around upgrading our firewalls, of making sure that all of the patches have been applied to software have been effective, so we have not had any issues with this"
163,"Very clearly, every time there is a big story, in this case, massive number of stories, the attention level around the notion of security goes up"
164,"And we-re sitting in the space where the idea is to design security in the first place, not to just fix all the things that went wrong in the past but make it essentially correct by construction"
165,"And so from that perspective, I think we-re in a very healthy situation"
166,"If you amend that by the fact that Gartner which tracks many, many security-related companies such as ourselves, are now putting us in the leading quadrant for the activities that we do, obviously, the attention that this is getting is positive for our business even if it's negative for the world"
167,"and so we-re seeing that with the acquisition of Cigital, with the commentary that Trac just gave you on the existing business"
168,"I feel that we can now state that this business has, for lack of better term, reached critical mass"
169,"And what I mean with that is that a number of years ago, we made the decision to move up from the silicon to the software"
170,"We made a decision to bank beyond the hardware and software intersection and that, moreover, this new TAM that touches many companies that, in the past, we have no business with looks very promising"
171,There were many execution challenges in getting there
172,I think we've navigated well through those
173,And I'm very encouraged with where we-re in the middle of 2017 because we see this vision materializing
174,"And hopefully, it's not on the back of catastrophes around us but more on the premise that building correctly for the future"
175,is really where the software industry should go and that is where our contribution will be
176,"Well, for the first part of your question, yes, we think that it is in the low double digits"
177,"So far, the team has been executing particularly well and if you look at it from the complex chips, our expectations are that we will continue to see good growth and healthy business there"
178,"I'm sorry, I couldn't acoustically hear your second part of the question"
179,"Oh, yes, sure, sorry"
180,"Yes, automotive has been an interesting area because it's having so much attention, frankly, by a whole number of people that may create a bit of a bubble there"
181,"But at the same time, there's a good reason it's getting so much attention which is it is the showcase for what modern hardware software will be able to do to fundamentally transform a field that has been relatively slow in evolving"
182,"It is now evolving very, very rapidly"
183,"And so we have invested quite a bit over the last few years not only to make sure that the tools are capable of dealing with this type of designs, but our IP portfolio has grown significantly in the realm of having certified IP"
184,And certification of IP is for one key reason which is automotive demands a certain set of checks to make sure that what you're doing is actually safe
185,"And in the past, safety has been actually developed quite well in automotive"
186,"With this very, very rapid increase of both hardware and software,"
187,"the complexity that comes with that is going to be a challenge for safety and the fact that we have a portfolio that is now massively certified, I think, bodes very well for our position there"
188,"Well, one of the key pieces is that the intersection of hardware and software has been driving verification extremely hard and a subcategory to that is really emulation and prototyping"
189,We refer to that as hardware
190,And that growth has just been exemplary because so many people would like to run software on hardware they don't have
191,"and so instead, they use an emulator to sort of fake the hardware if you like"
192,"And I expect that to continue because if you want to go to market, you want to start the software development as soon as you possibly can and make sure that it's going to work with the hardware that takes a long time to manufacture"
193,So that has really been one of the key variables in this game
194,"Well, thank you very much for attending this earnings release"
195,"Hopefully, you took away that we had a very strong quarter, that the outlook for the coming quarter is strong, the overall year is looking extremely solid"
196,"But most importantly, I think the alignment around our Silicon to Software strategy appears to be working quite well and all the individual businesses have contributed strongly to our present success"
197,"So with the intent to continue on that trajectory, we thank you for your support and attention"
