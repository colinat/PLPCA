Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone
Before we get into the segment results and updates that I typically go through, I want to cover our orders for the quarter, which help provide the foundation for the trends that we are seeing as well as of our expectations going forward
If you could please turn to Slide 4, which shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business
Demonstrating our continued momentum that started late last year, orders were up 11% year-over-year, with the book-to-bill of 1.06. And on an organic basis, orders grew 10%
We saw organic orders growth across all three of our segments in quarter one, excluding SubCom
We also saw orders growth in all regions with particular strength in Asia, which grew 26% year-over-year, with strength in China
In Europe and the Americas, orders grew approximately 3% and 1%, respectively
In Transportation, orders increased 12% year-over-year and were up 4% sequentially as China OEMs increased production ahead of the expected expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year
Industrial orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and organic orders grew 4%, with growth across each of our three industrial businesses
In Communications, excluding SubCom and the sale of our Circuit Protection business last year, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 14%, including 7% growth in data and devices as we begin ramping high-speed connectivity that is benefiting from cloud applications as Tom mentioned
Please turn to Slide 5 so we can discuss our results by segment and let me start with Transportation
The first quarter was an excellent quarter for our segment, with sales growing double-digits year-on-year and adjusted operating margins expanding 340 basis points on increased volume and productivity improvements
Segment sales exceeded the expectations due to strength in China and Korea
Our auto sales were up 13% organically in the quarter, well ahead of auto production growth of 5% due to increased content from the secular trends we talked to you about around safe, green and connected, coupled with our very strong global leadership position
Growth was led by demand from China as the expected expiration of government incentives spurred demand in the quarter
Note that these incentives are now being faced out over the course of the year, so as we look forward, we expect that vehicle production growth in China will continue to be front-end loaded in the first half of 2017. For the full year, we expect 4% growth in vehicle production in China and 2% growth in auto production globally
While this assumption of 2% auto production growth globally is an increase from our prior view of 1%, this sell-side comes from the strength in the first half in China, with our outlook for the second half production being the same as our view 90 days ago
For the full year, we expect to continue to outpace the growth of production due to the continued benefit of content growth as well as share gains
Turning to Commercial Transportation, our team delivered another very strong quarter against still a tough backdrop
This was outperformance versus the market, with organic revenue up 16%, driven by a very strong heavy truck market in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations as well as share gains
In our sensors business, the acquisition last year of Jaquet drove 3% growth overall
The business declined slightly on an organic basis, with growth in automotive applications and industrial applications being offset by softness in the North American heavy truck applications
We are expecting organic growth for the year in sensors and continue to expect a further growth inflection as we go into 2018 as further auto applications ramp the volume
For the segment, adjusted operating margins of 22% were up 340 basis points year-over-year, with strong flow-through on a double-digit organic sales and increase of productivity improvements
When you think about the segment margin, our margin expectations remained the same for the segment and you should continue to think of steady state transportation operating margins as 20% plus or minus to 1. Please turn to Slide 6, so I can discuss our Industrial Solutions segment, which performed in line on both the top line and on the margin side in quarter one
Industrial solutions sales grew 12% on a reported basis, driven by the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and generated 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite the 80 basis points of headwind from the declines in oil and gas
If we had owned Creganna and Intercontec in the year ago period, our growth for this business would grow up at 16% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance of these acquired businesses
Industrial Equipment, we grew 1% organically, driven by strengthening market around the factory automation area as well as growth in medical
Aerospace and defense remained strong with 4% organic growth, driven by increased content on new airframe builds as well as momentum in defense programs
Oil and gas declined 24% as expected due to the weakened market conditions and we feel that our oil and gas business has now bottomed and expect this business to remain stable at the current level as we benefit from new programs ramping later in the year
Our energy business declined 3% organically, with growth in North America and Asia more than offset by the softness in Europe
Adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations and expanded 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3%, which includes the oil and gas impact I mentioned earlier
Going forward, we do expect the industrial segment operating margins to expand over prior year levels in the second quarter and then further into second half throughout the segment
I would also like to note that we also included adjusted EBITDA margins on the chart show margins and margin expansion, excluding the impact from the acquisition related amortization
And you can see in the segment that the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points to 16.4%
So please turn to Slide 7, so I can talk about communications solutions
Quarter one was a solid quarter from the Communications segment, including our achievement of a key milestone in our data and devices business
D&D has returned to organic growth following 3 years of decline from product exits as we refocused the portfolio within the business
Organic growth is occurring six months sooner than we expected in the business
I would also like to highlight that we also have a very strong quarter growth in our appliances business and we saw continued operational improvements throughout the segment that I will talk more about in a little bit
Organically, sales were up 3%, with reported segment sales down 4% year-over-year, due primarily to the sale of the Circuit Protection business in March of last year
Our appliance business has very strong quarter growth, with 14% organic growth year-over-year, driven by China market growth, share gains and strength in North America
The growth in D&D is the result of new ramps at cloud customers and a completion of our multi-year journey to refocus the product portfolio in key growth applications
D&D grew 2% organically in the quarter and now we expect organic growth for the full fiscal year
In addition to the growth that we are excited about, data and devices also doubled its top earning adjusted margin from a year ago and we expect this business to be an increasing contributor to the profitability of the Communications segment going forward
On SubCom, the business declined slightly in the first quarter as a result of program timing
Our momentum continues through this growth cycle and we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 based upon our very strong backlog
For the Communications segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.2% for the quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year
And if you remember, this time last year, we had a one-time benefit on our SubCom business related to an early program completion, which raised our first quarter ‘16 margin in the segment by approximately 400 basis points
If you would normalize for this impact, Communications’ adjusted operating margins expanded significantly in the first quarter of ‘17. And to really illustrate the progress that we have made in this segment over the past four quarters, adjusted operating margins have expanded from approximately 8% in the second quarter of last year to 13% in the quarter we just completed
And we are proud of that accomplishment
So let me turn it over to Heath and he will cover the financials
Thanks, Heath
So now, I will get into our guidance for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2017. So, if you could please turn to Slide 10 and I will follow up with the quarter two outlook
We expect second quarter revenue of $3.025 billion to $3.125 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.09, representing sales growth of 4% on both the recorded and on an organic basis and 19% EPS growth at the midpoint
This guidance does include the impact of a stronger dollar, which we expect to be a $60 million headwind to sales and a $0.03 headwind to EPS on a year-over-year basis
Following two consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings per share and strong orders in the first quarter, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to also be a quarterly record and our guidance represents a strong first half of fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single-digits organically and low single-digits on a recorded basis due to the impact of the dollar
This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the second quarter, where exact growth will be driven by Asia and in Europe
Commercial transportation growth is expected to be driven by China
In industrial solutions, we expect to grow mid-teens overall through the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and we will be up low single-digits organically
And in communications, we expect mid single-digit organic growth, with growth in all three of our businesses
Now if you can turn to Slide 11 and let me cover full year guidance
Relative to our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our organic growth expectations for 2017 by 100 basis points and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, with better operational performance more than offsetting the headwinds from the strengthening dollar that Heath highlighted
While we are raising our guidance for the full year, we are maintaining our previous view of the second half by keeping our second half organic growth expectations consistent with our view, 90 days ago
I believe this is prudent given the uncertainty in the macro environment
And when you look at the implied trends for first half to second half, please keep in mind the impact of the stronger dollar and the tax dynamics that Heath mentioned earlier and we have some slide details in the back of slide material for your reference
For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.30 a share to $4.50 a share
This represents 3% reported growth, 4% organic growth on the top line and 11% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks of fiscal 2016. Relative to our prior view of revenue guidance, reported revenue growth is down 200 basis points due to the $300 million impact from the currency exchange rates
Our organic growth is up 100 basis points, reflecting improvement in the transportation and communication segments
We are raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS from $4.34 to $4.40, which in essence, includes a $0.22 increase due to operational improvements and better performance from our acquisitions
Then this is offset by $0.16 of headwind from the stronger dollar
So really, highlighting the strong business model Heath and Tom talked about
I do feel very good about our ability to drive 4% organic growth, expand the operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points and generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this uncertain macro environment
This is an improvement and demonstrates as the portfolio is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses
While much of our operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by our transportation segment, I am pleased that in 2017 our operating margin expansion will be driven by all three segments, with more contribution from communications and industrial
So before the full year guidance and thinking through the segments, we expect transportation solutions to be up mid single-digits organically, on 2% auto production growth reflecting content growth trends and share gains
We also expect commercial transportation to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market
And we expect sensors to grow mid single-digits in total year-over-year
Industrial Solutions’ organic growth guidance is not changing from 90 days ago and we continue to expect growth to be up low single-digits organically, with continued gains in commercial aerospace and defense as well as medical
Communications is expected to be up mid single-digits organically, an increase versus our prior year view due to the strength in appliances and data and devices
And as I mentioned earlier, we’ve hit a milestone of improved performance in the D&D business
Progress and growth and profitability is ahead of our prior expectations
We now expect organic growth for D&D in fiscal 2017 in the low single-digits and momentum in SubCom remains strong
And we continue to expect growth in the mid single-digits for the year in SubCom
Before I turn it back to Tom for closing comments, I do want to highlight that this is Tom’s last earnings call as our CEO, after doing about 40 of these earnings calls with you all
And I do want to say on behalf of the leadership team as well as our 70,000 employees I want to publicly thank Tom for his leadership over the past 10 years
So with that, Tom I will turn it back over to you for closing comments
Wamsi, let me take that
When you look at it, the first quarter what was a very strong quarter and it was driven at Asia
We saw I think, continued trends around sort of North America being flat, but we also did have growth in Europe
When you think through the content, it’s broad based
It is not one application and I think really when it comes to the perfect content and the share gains, it represents our strong global position that we have throughout automotive
I think when you look at the year, like I said in the guidance, we did expect automotive in the second half of the year production to slowdown versus the first half
We kept that the same
We still feel when you get to the second half, while production globally, we assume to be relatively flat
We are going to still drive mid single-digit organic growth, improve that organic content and growth story
So it’s just one of the elements of how production is with the strong Asia part in the first half, a lot of it is driven by China
But the content along all the trends we have, whether it’s electronification of the car, how the car gets more connected or around the green side of the car, how emissions and electronics get put them on
So it isn’t one specific area, it’s really the combination of all the trends we talked to you about
Hey Wamsi, it’s Terrence again
So as you know, we produce where our customers consume
So when you look at our footprint and a lot of the work that we have done to get our capacity to the right part that Tom and Heath talked about in their prepared comments, we feel very good about where our footprint is aligned with where our customers are
So we are fairly balanced when it comes to that element
How the border tax comes out, I think we all have to sit there and wait to see how that does
When we sit there today, we like where we are positioned manufacturing wise and we will keep you all updated
Clearly, on things and tax related to repatriation, being a Swiss company, that doesn’t really impact us positively or negatively
So from that viewpoint when we look at the guidance we gave you, it’s pretty much a steady-state guidance as we think about it
What I would say Craig, I think there is a couple of things
One of the things, if you look to the quarter, it’s very broad based across all our businesses
And that’s something you haven’t seen in a while
I would also say both through our direct customer relationships, I would also say our channel partners you will see some confidence in some of their activity
The other thing that I would say is – it is across – all orders grew in all three regions
So there is to your view, some glimmer of I think it shows the background around our markets, but I would also say there is still uncertainty in the macro when you deal with things like the currency rates that while we have capped our back half the way it is from where we guided
So when we sit there, I do think you are going to continue to see improvement
Clearly, you are going to see improvement in our Industrial and Communications segment as we go through the year
I think the order trends for some of the comments we made show very strong trends that we are excited about
And then also the element around D&D growth
That’s not a headwind thereafter
We did a lot of pruning to get that business focused on applications where we thought we could get paid for the great engineering and serve our customers for that we do
So I do think there are some positive glimmers of momentum not only in the business, but in the markets we serve
So, I do think it feels a little different from the backdrop than it was a year ago or even during certain times last year
Absolutely, certainly when you think about integrated products and where we bring [ph] sort of giving much more than just an interconnect product, but other technologies like sensors and sometimes even some of our cable technology on the material side, it does go broader than transmission
I know we use the transmission example as one to bring it to life, but it is then brake applications
It is then track applications
It’s throughout the auto, is where we get those
So it is much broader than that and probably what we should do is break some of those and there is the life as we talk to investors
I know we have been talking a lot about the transmission example
But Craig, I think the important point is, when you see the content growth that we are driving above production like we did in the first quarter and what we guided for the year in auto, it shows integrated solutions that help drive that content up
That’s why we have confidence that over time, what we do around $60 today, over the next 5 years, we can take up to that $80 range, not only from the trends that we benefit from, but also bringing those integrated solutions to our customers and we become more important to them and serve to many where they are in the world
Sure my comment was 20% Amit, plus or minus 1%
So I appreciate you being aggressive
Well and on the sensors, sensors actually – we all know that, that’s running single-digit as we continue to invest ahead of the range that we have ahead of us that will begin in 2018. So we do think that, that will be a lever over time as those programs ramp, but we saw a significant investment in those programs
So as we talk to you, we do think that app will get up to mid-teens EBITDA over time, but we are going to make investments and plan to ramp this programs and we are from a margin perspective, investing ahead
So I do think that’s something that we will have a little bit more of detail on it, but it will help the transportation margins over time
Sure, Jim
Let me take both of those
So let’s start with oil and gas
Number one is when you look at our oil and gas business, we basically are seeing stabilization
And that stabilization, we are happy to see certainly we hope upside comps as oil moves, but right now, I would say as we see it from the programs we are exposed to is much more around stabilization than I would say any ramp up
The other element that I would say when you think about our oil and gas business, it is very much around oceanic oil
So pipelines, land-based, we are not strong in that
So on that, it is important to understand this is really around offshore oil and gas and the indicators around that are really offshore rigs
So where we see things right now is it’s still stable in our guidance, and hopefully, we get some benefit from some of the things that President Trump is talking about that those kick in and help them back to get us little bit more upside in industrial
But that’s not assumed right now
On SubCom, we feel very good about where we are at
Similar really, not much has changed since the last quarter
Our guidance for the year is to be up 5% that will put us well over $900 million in revenue
Our backlog, we are booked for the – so really when we look at the programs that we win throughout this year, it’s really around 2018. So, 2017 is very locked and loaded
Our team is working very hard to execute to the backlog with where we are from an execution perspective and really program – it’s a pipeline of programs that we are quoting and trying to win, it’s still very active
So we still think we are in a growth phase, but I would just say, right now, the 5% that we talked about last quarter being up year-over-year, even though we were down a little bit due to timing in the first quarter, we feel right in front of us and it’s really around execution for us this year
So clearly, benefit from cloud applications, not only in SubCom, you’ve heard it in D&D, where we have also had that benefit
The hyperscale customers and we are getting benefits in both the segments from them
Sure
Well, a couple of different angles there
We did inch up the restructuring comments from 90 days ago and largely there is not one item on there that drives it
There is a list of several things, particularly around some footprint consolidation that continues to go on, or deals for acquisitions that have been completed over the last few years
And marginally, that’s facility consolidation
And then there are some structural things that we look at and we will continue to be ongoing, I’d say for this year and probably into the early part of next year, just in terms of how organized and the layers within the company
So more to come on that, but I think we are sharpening our pencils certainly
Not all $150 million of that restructuring would be cash charges
There is some things in there that are non-cash that we will talk about later in the year
So, more to come on that, but in the M&A side, certainly we are active
Intercontec has been a great performance out of the gate
We are also very pleased with the performance on the medical side, Creganna – well, both of those are well ahead of the deal model expectations and are executed very well
And Creganna, we will anniversary here little bit late this quarter, in terms of the fresh full year on our portfolio
The Medical space has continued to have legs to it
And so looking at things along that, maybe not the same size necessarily of ground type transaction, those things are a little bit closer to the Intercontec size or something, plus or minus in that range that have good margins and where we can get to a return on invested capital may be a little quicker than historically we have, so lots of opportunity out there, but we will be choosy and spend the shareholders’ dollar wisely
A couple of things, well, thanks for the question
Our expectations around sensors has not changed for the New Year
Overall, we expect growth to be mid single-digit
The only change we would have to be due to FX, so our expectation has not changed versus where we were
I think when you look at it, certainly, we did get impacted in our sensors business by the same thing that impacted our industrial business since we bought Measurement
And Measurement was very much focused on industrial applications
So as there was the industrial recession going on that impacted our Industrial segment, it did also impact the Measurement asset, then the growth was a little bit slower
What we really get excited about was when we bought Measurement, we basically signed up to scale that and use our go-to-market and take that great Measurement technology into different markets like automotive and to places like industrial transportation
And really, those program wins and that momentum there is very strong, that program pipeline is strong
But as you know, those programs don’t – one of the day and ship them in three months, they are programs that we have been building out past couple of years
And really you are going to see the growth of that, really in 2018 as when we are going to start having some of our launches
That’s why we are investing ahead in sensors and part of those programs
And in some cases, that they are integrated products
They are not just the sensor element, they are things that also have additional things on them
So we feel very good that we are leveraging our go-to-market to get those wins
Certainly, you are not seeing them in the numbers yet
And 2018 is when you are going to start to see those come through with revenue and going to be excited to show it to you in ’18 and shows you normalcy in 2017, is not just where the program ramps are
They are a big chunk order in automotive and they are among many technologies
So there you amended either temperature, the pressure, they are among many different technologies and in the sensor space the fragmentation around the sensor space, really make to that, you compete against different people not one competitor
So what’s really great about the programs we have won is they are among varying technologies, they are at different regions of the world, which really shows the strength of our go-to-market and then it also comes out some of that business case that when we bought Measurement to get these technologies, how do we leverage our go-to-market in places where we have very exceptional leadership positions like our Transportation segment, we are leveraging
So we will continue to share those as they ramp, but 2018 will be the year where you will start seeing it in the numbers versus just from our works
When you look at it Mark, similar to last quarter, we knew there is this China incentives that was ending at the end of the first quarter
We expected a slide in China demand that the incentive is sort of phased out throughout the year
We do expect production to still stay strong into the second quarter, but there is still is an element of when you have incentives, this is pull forward demand
And so when we look at it and talking to our customers, they have told us things back to production to moderate in the second half versus a very strong level we are going to have in the first quarter and continue a little bit in the second quarter
So it’s not really different that while we pull forward, just we are getting a little bit decreased production due to the incentive being phased out
So when we look at the second half, the second half is identical to where we were 90 days ago and if there is more incentives around China, I would expect we would benefit from it, but they are not there yet
And we are really aligned with our customers
So like we said, we expect auto production in our third and fourth quarter to be relatively flat, globally
But we expect organic growth in our automotive business, even in a flat environment due to our content and share gains
So when you look at that year-on-year, we do expect growth in transportation in a flat backdrop production months right now
Tom, do you want to start with that and I will jump in then?
Now, when you look at it clearly, we view that as an opportunity
When you get into any integration and one of the things that’s great about the business that we have always had is we benefit from electronics trends, but we also get integrated out due to electronic trends
Connectors can be integrated out by semiconductors and so forth, but because there are more electronics happening, it also creates in that content opportunity
I think when we look at it Steve, it’s really around it creates more opportunity because of the abilities we have and the value we provide to our customers
So why as we said there it’s why we get excited about our content in auto being able to grow from the 60 to 80 that we talked about, because what sensors brings to it, how we integrate these things in, I mean we probably aren’t to a turnkey level, but you describe how I think about it, but that integration we provide to allow some way to get to a turnkey level is very important
And that drives the content growth opportunity and the stickiness we have with our customers and our engineers basically create so much more opportunities
So we knew that’s a net-net opportunity
We don’t view its displacement, because we are very close to the architecture of the vehicle and what we do
And that is a very important factor as people continue to evolve the architecture
The world that we play in partnering with BOEs and the Tier 1s, both of them are our customers is really what we get excited about why I am so buoyant on the content opportunity
So it’s all plus
I think when you look at it, I think you can always think that we have always a priority towards the components side, but even when you do take Creganna, that is doing more than just a component
So I think you will see things over time of that can add integration like skills
But I think it will be a balance of both and it will be how does it tie into our strategies in different markets
I think you have seen move into that with Creganna, but we had more the component they had much more a full assembly and integration capability that we had and that’s one of the things we get excited about the close of our customers and medical wanted that
And we would bring it organically alone
So I think you will see a little bit of a different answer in different markets, but I think you expect a little bit above from us
