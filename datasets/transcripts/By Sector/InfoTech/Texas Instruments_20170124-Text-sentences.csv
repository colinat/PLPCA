8,TI’s results to differ materially from managements’ current expectations
9,"We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description"
10,"As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today"
11,"Also with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1st"
12,"Rafael joined TI in 2001, and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012."
13,He holds a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S
14,"Military Academy of West Point, and Masters in Business of Administration from Stanford University"
15,"As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year"
16,"During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown in average of 13% annually"
17,"Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%"
18,We’ve all benefitted and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI's shares get a good return on their investment
19,Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael
20,"I don’t want to get too sentimental, but as this is Kevin's final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure"
21,it's been for me to know and to work with him
22,TI is clearly a better Company because of his leadership
23,I will say he has an outstanding successor
24,"I worked with Rafael for the past decade, and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO"
25,"With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that’s important to calendars"
26,We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8th at 10:00 AM Central time
27,"Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy"
28,"In today's earnings call, Rafael, will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks and Kevin and I will cover the rest"
29,"Now, let's start with the quick summary of our financial results"
30,"Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year-ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market"
31,The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continues
32,Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year-ago
33,I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments
34,"In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago"
35,Operating margin increased in both businesses
36,"Earnings per share were $1.02, and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter"
37,"With that back-drop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TIs business model"
38,"In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion"
39,"We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term"
40,"Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago"
41,"Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago"
42,"We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand"
43,We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders
44,"In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases"
45,"Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter"
46,"Revenue increased due to power management, high-performance Analog, and Silicon Valley Analog"
47,High-volume Analog in logic was about even
48,Embedded Processing increased 6% from the year ago quarter due to processors and micro-controllers
49,Connectivity also grew
50,"In our other segment, revenues declined 9% from a year ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products"
51,DLP products and calculators were about even
52,"For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%"
53,"Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI’s revenue for the year"
54,"We’ve recently simplified the product lines inside our two business segments, Analog and Embedded"
55,"To align by product categories, our customers think about"
56,"Making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial"
57,Analog is now comprised of three product lines instead of four
58,"These are power, signal chain and high-volume Analog in logic"
59,Embedded goes from three product lines to two
60,"Connected MCU, which merges connectivity and micro-controllers and processors, which is essentially unchanged"
61,All of these changes are at the product line levels
62,Nothing changes at the segment level
63,"To help you understand this structure, for 2016 within our Analog business, power would have been about 45% of Analog revenue, signal chain would have been about 35% and high volume in Analog and logic would have been the remaining 20%"
64,"Inside our embedded business, connected MCU would have been about 55% of embedded revenue with processors comprising the remaining 45%"
65,"Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we’ll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments"
66,"Now, let me describe our performance by end-market for 2016."
67,This is a reminder we annually provide an estimate of TI’s revenue by end markets
68,"We breakeven to six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators"
69,"Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015."
70,"Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points"
71,"Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points"
72,"Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6% respectively, both year and to last year, while other was about 4%"
73,We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016.
74,"For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we’ve been highly focused on a strategy where we’ve been allocating our capital"
75,and we’ve been driving initiatives to increase our market share and industrial and automotive
76,"This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they provide the diversity and longevity of products which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio"
77,"In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI’s revenue, up from 44% just two years ago"
78,"We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied, and are continuing to make improvements, such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products"
79,"With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin"
80,"Thank you, Kevin"
81,"Operator, you can now open the lines for questions"
82,"In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask question, please limit yourself to a single question"
83,"After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up"
84,Kevin
85,Question-and-Answer Session
86,And we’ll go to the next caller
87,please
88,I haven’t
89,"but I would certainly can, inventory was even with the Eureco [ph] and decreased by about a half of week sequentially"
90,And it's still running at around four weeks in the channel
91,And I just also have a reminder that that number benefits because of our consignment programs that we have in place with our distributors
92,"Yes, so I think if you look at year-over-year by end market, personal electronics was down slightly due to mobile phones"
93,"So, if you back out mobile phones the actually personal electronics was up slightly, so that was the main reason that we saw that"
94,You could kind of see that inside of our Analog
95,"And that weakness in mobile phones was not just inside of HVAL, but you've saw that to a lesser extent inside the Power"
96,I'll just add Stacy as a seamless plug for our capital management call
97,Rafael and I'll cover more that detail in our capital management call
98,"Stacy, let me just add to that that are -- for looking at next year our commitment, our capital management strategy and the discipline execution of that strategy remains unchanged"
99,Our target is to return all of our free cash to the owners of the Company
100,"And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases"
101,You have follow on to that?
102,"Yes, I think if you look for -- look at it for the full year, it decreased 3% year-on-year"
103,"And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned"
104,And we expect kind of going forward that we would be somewhere in a mid-single digit decline
105,"There is seasonality inside of the other business it's driven primarily by calculators, they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school"
106,and then we also have royalties inside there that can choppy every once in a while
107,"So those are the types of things, but overall when you look at much like this year we saw a 3% decline just probably similar to what we would expect to see going forward"
108,"Ambrish, actually, if you look at the actual numbers"
109,I know you are using the rounded numbers that we've gave you
110,"It's more like the mid-single digit, so a growth for the Europe, for industrial '"
111,"16 over '15, and it good to see"
112,", good solid growth there"
113,"When we look the down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors 14 year"
114,So again it's kind of same comments and hit on the automotive
115,we are just encouraged that our investments are really turning to that broad based growth
116,Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?
117,"Yes, so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any sector, but I think your instincts that will have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a year ago will probably be correct"
118,We have got time for one last call please
119,"Yes, there is a -- we are seeing that really broad based growth across regions, across products and across those 14 sectors that we have got in it"
120,"So, we're real pleased with that growth"
121,"Yes, it included several agreements with the several different cross licensees, but the part of that was a sale of some IP assets, and that was recognized and restructuring other lines"
122,And then the balance was settlement of past infringement that was recognized in the other income expense model
123,"On an ongoing basis, it tends to be multi across license agreements"
124,"So, we would expect about $20 million of annual benefit for the foreseeable future as a result of agreement to these new intellectual property contracts"
125,It's a roughly $20 million a year annual benefit going forward
126,And thank you all for joining us
127,Again please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 8th at 10 AM Central Time
128,A replay of this call is available on our website
