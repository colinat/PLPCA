This call is being broadcast live over the Web, and can be accessed through our Web site
A replay will be available through the Web
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from managements’ current expectations
We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description
As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today
Also with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1st
Rafael joined TI in 2001, and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S
Military Academy of West Point, and Masters in Business of Administration from Stanford University
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year
During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown in average of 13% annually
Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%
We’ve all benefitted and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI's shares get a good return on their investment
Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael
I don’t want to get too sentimental, but as this is Kevin's final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him
TI is clearly a better Company because of his leadership
I will say he has an outstanding successor
I worked with Rafael for the past decade, and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that’s important to calendars
We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8th at 10:00 AM Central time
Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy
In today's earnings call, Rafael, will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks and Kevin and I will cover the rest
Now, let's start with the quick summary of our financial results
Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year-ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market
The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continues
Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year-ago
I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago
Operating margin increased in both businesses
Earnings per share were $1.02, and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter
With that back-drop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TIs business model
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion
We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago
Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders
In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases
Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter
Revenue increased due to power management, high-performance Analog, and Silicon Valley Analog
High-volume Analog in logic was about even
Embedded Processing increased 6% from the year ago quarter due to processors and micro-controllers
Connectivity also grew
In our other segment, revenues declined 9% from a year ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products
DLP products and calculators were about even
For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%
Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI’s revenue for the year
We’ve recently simplified the product lines inside our two business segments, Analog and Embedded
To align by product categories, our customers think about
Making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial
Analog is now comprised of three product lines instead of four
These are power, signal chain and high-volume Analog in logic
Embedded goes from three product lines to two
Connected MCU, which merges connectivity and micro-controllers and processors, which is essentially unchanged
All of these changes are at the product line levels
Nothing changes at the segment level
To help you understand this structure, for 2016 within our Analog business, power would have been about 45% of Analog revenue, signal chain would have been about 35% and high volume in Analog and logic would have been the remaining 20%
Inside our embedded business, connected MCU would have been about 55% of embedded revenue with processors comprising the remaining 45%
Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we’ll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments
Now, let me describe our performance by end-market for 2016. This is a reminder we annually provide an estimate of TI’s revenue by end markets
We breakeven to six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points
Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points
Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6% respectively, both year and to last year, while other was about 4%
We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we’ve been highly focused on a strategy where we’ve been allocating our capital and we’ve been driving initiatives to increase our market share and industrial and automotive
This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they provide the diversity and longevity of products which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI’s revenue, up from 44% just two years ago
We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied, and are continuing to make improvements, such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin
Thank you, Kevin
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions
In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask question, please limit yourself to a single question
After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up
Kevin
Question-and-Answer Session
And we’ll go to the next caller please
I haven’t but I would certainly can, inventory was even with the Eureco [ph] and decreased by about a half of week sequentially
And it's still running at around four weeks in the channel
And I just also have a reminder that that number benefits because of our consignment programs that we have in place with our distributors
Yes, so I think if you look at year-over-year by end market, personal electronics was down slightly due to mobile phones
So, if you back out mobile phones the actually personal electronics was up slightly, so that was the main reason that we saw that
You could kind of see that inside of our Analog
And that weakness in mobile phones was not just inside of HVAL, but you've saw that to a lesser extent inside the Power
I'll just add Stacy as a seamless plug for our capital management call
Rafael and I'll cover more that detail in our capital management call
Stacy, let me just add to that that are -- for looking at next year our commitment, our capital management strategy and the discipline execution of that strategy remains unchanged
Our target is to return all of our free cash to the owners of the Company
And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases
You have follow on to that?
Yes, I think if you look for -- look at it for the full year, it decreased 3% year-on-year
And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned
And we expect kind of going forward that we would be somewhere in a mid-single digit decline
There is seasonality inside of the other business it's driven primarily by calculators, they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school and then we also have royalties inside there that can choppy every once in a while
So those are the types of things, but overall when you look at much like this year we saw a 3% decline just probably similar to what we would expect to see going forward
Ambrish, actually, if you look at the actual numbers I know you are using the rounded numbers that we've gave you
It's more like the mid-single digit, so a growth for the Europe, for industrial '16 over '15, and it good to see, good solid growth there
When we look the down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors 14 year
So again it's kind of same comments and hit on the automotive we are just encouraged that our investments are really turning to that broad based growth
Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?
Yes, so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any sector, but I think your instincts that will have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a year ago will probably be correct
We have got time for one last call please
Yes, there is a -- we are seeing that really broad based growth across regions, across products and across those 14 sectors that we have got in it
So, we're real pleased with that growth
Yes, it included several agreements with the several different cross licensees, but the part of that was a sale of some IP assets, and that was recognized and restructuring other lines
And then the balance was settlement of past infringement that was recognized in the other income expense model
On an ongoing basis, it tends to be multi across license agreements
So, we would expect about $20 million of annual benefit for the foreseeable future as a result of agreement to these new intellectual property contracts
It's a roughly $20 million a year annual benefit going forward
And thank you all for joining us
Again please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 8th at 10 AM Central Time
