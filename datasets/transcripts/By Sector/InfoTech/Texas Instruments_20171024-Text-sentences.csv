39,Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%
40,"For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million"
41,This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter
42,"For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates"
43,You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website under the Financial Summary Data section
44,"Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages"
45,We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress
46,"With that, let me turn it back to Dave"
47,"Yes, Adam, thanks for giving me opportunity to talk about that"
48,"On free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis, and that is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same basis"
49,"And the difference is higher working capital, particularly accounts receivables and tax payments"
50,"If you look at the accounts receivable from 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016, that actually drained whereas from 3Q 2016 to 3Q 2017, it built"
51,So that is a source of cash in one case and a use of cash in another case
52,"But, and in the case of the tax payments, we had a higher, disproportionately higher tax payment in the most recent comparison versus the previous trailing 12-month comparison"
53,"Yes, I'll take that"
54,"For OpEx, we think of that in terms of, from a model standpoint, we think of it as a percent of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and for the last couple years, we've actually been running at about 23%"
55,"And in the current trailing 12-months, we're about 22% of revenue"
56,"So we have said that in a stable environment, which we are, we can run in the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%"
57,"So we've been running at about 22%, so that's well within that"
58,"Of course to us, OpEx are investments, and obviously that goes for R&D, but even inside of G&A we think of a large portion there as investment"
59,"So in R&D of course we're focusing on industrial and automotive, because those are the best markets"
60,where semiconductor growth is happening
61,"But in the G&A front, we have many investments there on ti"
62,"com and demand creation just to continue building on our reach of channels, reach of markets, competitive advantage that we have talked about"
63,"Before we go to the next caller, I'd like to just make a comment on the previous question on working capital"
64,"I want to stress that while our accounts receivables increased in that last comparison, the delta days sales outstanding actually decreased by 1 day"
65,So it's at 34.
66,So that just goes to show you how healthy the account receivable balance is
67,I wanted just to clarify that
68,Yes
69,What I would tell you is that generally what we suggest and what we recommend to analysts and investors to think about our fall through – in the 70% to 75% range
70,"But that is over the long haul, over a relatively long amount of time"
71,"In any one quarter, that fall through can be a little different"
72,"Now for example, in the comparison versus a year ago, which arguably, I would argue is more relevant as it has more time obviously in between, that was close to an 85% fall through, right"
73,"The increase in gross margin was 240 basis points, just as an example of a comparison to the sequential basis"
74,"Well, to your point, the profitability of that business has in fact improved significantly"
75,"On a year on year basis, profit from operation is up 673 basis points"
76,"But at the end of the day, the main objective here is to grow free cash flow"
77,"We think that is – we believe that is what really drives value for the owners of the company, so and then return all that free cash flow to the owners"
78,So we're not particularly focused on any one of those percentages because there are many ways to drive that free cash flow and one of them is expanding the margins
79,"But then the other one is just growing the top line at the same margin, right"
80,So that's the key message that the core objective that we're trying to achieve
81,"Book-to-bill was, it was 1.0."
82,"Well, it came in about as expected"
83,So I wouldn't characterize it as a bit light
84,"And as I mentioned earlier on an earlier question, on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how we think is appropriate to look at, is, came in at 22%"
85,I think in the last couple years it's been at 23%
86,"So it's trended a little down over the last few years, but it is well within the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%, which is our expectations when things are stable, which they are now"
87,"On gross margins, what we have said before, and we'll continue to say, really hasn't changed our guidance on that is that our general expectation is revenue to pull through at about 70% to 75%"
88,"And that's over the long haul, right, not in any one quarter"
89,So you should think about it that way
90,"And as we continue to grow the top line, driven by our investments in analog and embedded from a product standpoint, and industrial, automotive from an end market standpoint, we expect to continue gaining share and that additional revenue to fall through at about those rates"
