8,"I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow"
9,I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance
10,"As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago"
11,The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter
12,"Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1%, compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016."
13,"Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares"
14,"This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively"
15,"For the past two years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share"
16,"Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 25%"

18,"Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million, compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year"

20,The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter
21,"With respect to full-year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion range provided on our prior earnings call"
22,"Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call"
23,Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million
24,Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million
25,"And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, changed from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call"
26,"As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures"
27,"As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention, based on current conditions, is to not redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue"
28,"The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sale on April 1, 2017."
29,"In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017."
30,"Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks"
31,"Thanks, Sterling"
32,"In short, we saw increased demand from the U.S"
33,"-based registrars in the quarter, which was aided, in part, by what we call domain name-centric advertising by several channel partners in and around the Super Bowl, which happened in the February timeframe"
34,That hasn't changed too much over the years
35,That's still very consistent
36,"You are correct, Sterling"
37,That marketing spend was down sequentially
38,"The reason behind that is partly because Q4 was so high, we had a large amount of marketing spend going into the market in Q4."
39,"And then, with regard to our marketing spend this year, the timing of our marketing activities are more heavily weighted toward events later in the year than last year"
40,"So, as we've outlined in our 10-Q, our expectation for marketing expense is to increase as a percent of sales in the subsequent quarters"
41,We're not disclosing the sale proceeds from iDefense
42,"We have three of the transliterations in market, two in Korea and one in Japan"
43,"At this point, we don't have any additional details on any additional launches"
