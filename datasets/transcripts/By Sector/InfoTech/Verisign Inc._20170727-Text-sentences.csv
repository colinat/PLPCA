15,"I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow"
16,I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance
17,"As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017."
18,Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016.
19,"Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares"
20,"This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter, based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares respectively"
21,"Results for the second quarter included pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06."
22,"As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results"
23,"Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million, compared with $167 million and $161 million respectively for the second quarter last year"
24,"Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares, based on average share price during the second quarter, compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter"
25,The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter
26,"With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion range provided on our prior earnings call"
27,Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%
28,"Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million, as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance"
29,"Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call"
30,And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million
31,"The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures"
32,"As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue"
33,"In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017."
34,"Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks"
35,"The only other point I'd put on that, Rob, is as you saw in the first quarter, we had also good demand coming out of the U.S"
36,"market, and that strength in the U.S"
37,continued into the second quarter
38,"Well, we provided our guidance for our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year just now, but as far as how expenses flow, what we've outlined in our 10-Q is we do expense our sales and marketing expenses to be higher in the second half of the year, but we'll continue to manage all the expenses of the business, and we expect to be within the non-GAAP operating margin of between 64.5% to 64.25% just given earlier"
39,So we did see a slight increase in G&A expense in the quarter
40,"During the quarter we purchased some additional software licenses for the core business, and we also had slightly higher legal fees in the quarter"
41,"But again, on a non-GAAP basis, we were pretty much flat"
42,We can consistently be around about $100 million non-GAAP operating expense level
43,"Well, I'm not sure what you mean by excess expense, Greg"
44,"I mean, we continue to manage all the lines of expenses throughout the business pretty much on a quarterly and monthly basis"
45,"And each quarter, there's always going to be some type of expense that comes in that might not have been planned or one might call non-recurring"
46,"But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view as non-recurring"
47,"As I said, in the quarter we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter, But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company"
48,"And so again, I'd look back at the big picture"
49,"On a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million"
50,"And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount, and year-over-year, I believe it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there"
51,"We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis, and that's really a function of two areas"
52,"One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, if you looked at our website, we brought on an SVP of Product"
53,"And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer-term incentive programs, and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on the results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerators that get accrue there as we continue to execute"
54,So we'll continue to try to do that
55,"But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation"
56,"And as I said, we had a few other nits and that in the quarter"
57,"But in general, very consistent with the year-ago period as well as sequentially"
