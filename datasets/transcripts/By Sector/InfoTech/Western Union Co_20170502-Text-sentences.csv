92,"So, to summarize, the first quarter business performance was solid, strategic progress continued and we are on track with our full-year outlook"
93,"Operator, we're now ready to take questions"
94,Question-and-Answer Session
95,"I mean, as we go through the course of the year, Tien-Tsin, we should get benefits from the cost savings initiatives"
96,Most of that benefit will hit us in the second half of the year
97,"And then, based on our current forecast for foreign exchange rates, we think that FX impact will be a little bit less in the second half of the year, so you get a pickup on those items"
98,"We had somewhat of a marketing benefit in the first quarter, and I expect that we'll get back to our normal averages for marketing spend"
99,", there's some timing in the first quarter"
100,So that will also pick up
101,"So, net-net, that's how we get back to roughly our 20% adjusted margin for the full year, and some of the things that will happen from a quarterly standpoint"
102,"It's the way â in our consumer bill payments business, we're seeing â we had couple of things happening over the course of the last year"
103,"We had a large customer that we brought on at lower margins, and then we also saw consumers using credit cards to make payments, and that's a more expensive transaction for us"
104,"So, it ends up being more expensive for us"
105,"And although margins were down from the first quarter of last year, we actually did improve quite a bit from the fourth quarter where we were in the C2B business"
106,"So, the goal there has been to get really good top-line growth, and we're getting a lot of success there"
107,", we're adding to the portfolio"
108,And then that gives us an opportunity to stabilize margins and maybe improve them over time
109,"Hi, Darrin"
110,And the great thing about India is that we have fantastic retail coverage
111,And we also have fantastic account coverage
112,We pay out into most accounts in India
113,the infrastructure is right to improve there
114,"I mean, we had planned on â"
115,"obviously our outlook for the full year has not changed, so 11% and then 13% adjusted"
116,"So, we had planned on these activities for the year"
117,"The timing in the first quarter was less under our control, I would say"
118,"And so, we're going to get those same benefits"
119,"the rest of this year, because we had planned on it"
120,We've basically accelerated into Q1.
121,"And then, the second and third quarters should be closer to our full year average tax rate"
122,"And the fourth quarter, I would expect to be substantially lower because we have a number of different discrete benefits that we had already planned on, plus this timing benefit"
123,"So, it should be substantially lower than you'll see for even the second and third quarter as we go into the fourth quarter"
124,"Well, the XE"
125,com customer is something we spoke about last year
126,"We knew that we were going to lose it at the end of last year, which is what happened"
127,"And so we're going to see that grow over impact at least through the first three quarters of this year, a little bit in the fourth quarter"
128,"So you'll see a three-point impact from that as we move through, but our goal is to grow the business faster than what we achieved in the first quarter"
129,That's not an acceptable growth level for us
130,And we're doing a number of good things in that business where we want to drive better growth
131,So I would not model minus 3% in that business
132,", that's not our objective"
133,Our objective is to grow better than that
134,"The C2B business has been growing in the low double-digit range for quite a long time now, the last several years"
135,"And what we saw in the quarter, we also had good reported growth in that business of 8%, and that's because Argentina didn't devalue as much as we had expected"
136,But we continue to see really good growth opportunities for that business
137,"It's being driven by a couple of different things, the Argentina cash walk-in business where consumers are paying bills at retail locations, and then our electronic payments business here in the U.S"
138,And then that's being offset a little bit by U.S
139,"So, the growth profile of that business continues to be very strong, and we continue to add to the portfolio"
140,And we're very excited about the opportunities in that business
141,"No, it's a longer-term impact on the tax structure"
142,The activity relates specially to our Business Solutions business and the licensing requirements that are coming next year in Europe related to some of the products that we sell â the derivatives products that we sell
143,"So, we had to make some changes"
144,"As you know â as you may know, we own a bank in Austria"
145,"And so, we've combined or we're going to be combining those organizations to provide the right type of licensing structure ultimately"
146,So that's the underlying activity that we're driving at
147,"I mean, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize how we spend there"
148,"And over time, the composition of how we spent that money has changed, right?"
149,"And as we've completed many of the Southwest Border requirements, that spending has gotten less over the last couple of years, but it's migrated to other programs"
150,"So, we're always putting technology in place and we want to automate those things"
151,"Our first priority this year really is to address the requirements that we have under the settlement agreements, and that's the reason for the higher spend this year"
152,And we'll look to stabilize as much as we can over time
153,"Well, Ashwin, I believe that the Western Union Business Solutions should have a better performance than we reported in Q1, I agree on that with you"
154,"I think, the global economic environment, when that improves, when more export-import connection happens, especially on the small and mid-sized business entities, that will improve given how linked that sending money and receiving money is with importer and exporter"
155,"Besides that, I don't believe that we need a significant investment there to improve our performance"
156,"It's more really a focus on the sales getting new customers, where its liking is that I understand more is on the foreign trade part â foreign exchange trade part on the hedges and on the forwards"
157,We have some performance issue
158,"However, the payments part, like the invested (42:11) payments, like NGO payments is doing very well"
159,How you pay your builds or cross-border builds during (42:18) performance very well
160,"However, on the trading part, foreign exchange trading part, we do need some more focus here"
161,And I know the team is doing a little â putting also Wu Way activities around
162,"that's looking really how we can improve the part generally, this part has to improve, and I believe that over time it will improve"
163,It's all about mix
164,"You know our business very well, Ashwin, depending on the corridor"
165,"We do have corridors, which is zero FX"
166,"We do have corridors, which are higher FX, zero fees"
167,We do have corridors where there's both are that
168,"It's really like an airline management where you fly from one destination to another destination, which seats you for use, and that's exactly what we are doing with our teams"
169,"I think, in the portfolio management, the team is impressive"
170,"It's really looking at every corridor, understanding the customer needs on FX side"
171,I believe there is room
172,"We can be even better there, having the right balance between foreign exchange and fees, but our business model is built mostly on fee and less on FX"
173,"But there is, I believe, opportunity to see the customer need and go after that"
174,That keeps the â the mix also keeps the flexibility as to keeping the pricing stable
175,"And as I mentioned earlier, our prices are higher than the competition, but the market and the customer feel comfortable with the prices"
176,And the 2% constant currency growth is definitely something that are also transaction growth
177,reflects that
178,"Yeah, our cash balance was higher at the end of the first quarter than we've had for some time"
179,"It was higher than the end of the year, because we did raise some debt in the first quarter"
180,We also issued some term debt as well as some commercial paper
181,And that's in anticipation of making these final payments for the legal settlements
182,So that's why you see a higher level of cash
183,"By the end of the year, we should be at a lower level of cash"
184,We currently have about half of the cash at the end of the first quarter U.S
185,"-based, and the rest of it's abroad"
186,"On an ongoing basis, we generate about 75% or so of our cash flow outside the U.S"
187,And that includes any repatriation that we may do back to the U.S
188,", normal repatriation"
189,"So, if we were to get comprehensive tax reform, that could potentially alleviate any future issues of repatriation of foreign profit, which should be a good thing for us"
190,"I mean, we're excited about the Facebook announcement and the potential there"
191,It's a great product
192,"Our customers really don't have to leave the messenger environment to do a transaction, but for us it's just another channel to allow customers to do a transaction with us,"
193,right
194,"Whether it's Viber or WeChat or Facebook, we just want to provide as many avenues as possible for customers to be able to do a transaction with us"
195,"On Facebook specifically, whether they come through Facebook or whether they come to us directly on wu"
196,"com, we're really indifferent because the economics of that transaction are about the same for us"
197,"So, we'll see â it's early stages, but we'll see how that kind of transpires"
198,Yeah
199,We've raised the debt in the first quarter to make the payments in the second quarter â first and second quarter
200,"So, that's why you see an elevated level of debt"
201,"The only other piece that we have there is, we have a refinancing to do of another $500 million maturity at the end of this year"
202,"So, we will likely pre-finance that before the December maturity"
203,So you'll see potentially some higher levels of debt
204,"But by the end of the year, we should be at about where we were for the first quarter, assuming nothing else changes"
205,"Well, last year, we spent â we are at 3.6% of revenues in the first quarter"
206,"And in the first quarter this year, we're at 3.7%"
207,So it's not a dramatic difference
208,"And for the full year, I would expect this to be at the higher end of our 3.5% to 4% range"
209,"And in the last couple of years, we've been closer to 3.5%"
210,"I would expect to be at a more full run rate, but we're going to keep looking for more opportunities there"
211,"So, right now, we plan for about $20 million this year, and"
212,"then incrementally $25 million next year, but"
213,we're going to keep looking for more opportunities for savings
214,Sure
215,"I think, it has been obviously a great growth rate, and we believe that we are absolutely growing faster than the competition, and the team is executing very well"
216,"Don't forget, I mean, I said we are â just launched 40 countries, it's only 40 countries to send money to 200 countries"
217,"And the new countries will generate until they come really on a revenue generating mode, it will even be better, and then we want to be in 200 countries to send 200 countries, like our agent network"
218,And so that's something the team is focused
219,That's something that we are extremely optimistic that our digital expansion will continue
220,"And combining digital with retail, it's the secret sauce, different customer use cases"
221,"So, I'm quite optimistic, and the teams are also optimistic on that"
222,Still 80% of the customers didn't use the recent â retail money transferred for the last
