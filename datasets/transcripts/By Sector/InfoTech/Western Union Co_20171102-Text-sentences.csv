81,"Operator, we are now ready to take questions"
82,Question-and-Answer Session
83,"Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj"
84,We are guiding to approximately 20%
85,"So it could be a little bit above or around that range, it really depends on how the spending goes in the fourth quarter"
86,"We have planned for additional spend in marketing in other areas in the fourth quarter, so the margins are likely to be lower in the fourth quarter, but the overall margin for the year should be still quite solid"
87,As you've seen
88,Yeah
89,On the mix impact of about 1 point in the quarter that's something that we have been seeing for this year
90,It's really hard to predict exactly where that will be
91,And it really just depends on where we're getting the growth
92,and obviously the growth is coming from lower RPT corridors and lower growth in higher RPT corridors and if you look at last year it was about the same and
93,"then, in 2015 it was flattish in terms of overall mix impact"
94,"And the World Bank data, they adjusted their principal growth for last year and our principal growth was in line with what the World Bank showed and then for this year, they expect something just under 4% principal growth"
95,"Our third quarter, we grew about 4% in principal, so we'll see where we end up for the year, but we're tracking in terms of at least the third quarter"
96,"Darrin, we have, as you know, we have thousands and thousands of corridors, so we're always moving pricing in many of those corridors, sometimes up, sometimes down, but on a macro basis, it doesn't translate too much in terms of net change"
97,"But individually, individual corridors we're moving pricing for sure"
98,Yeah
99,I would say both of those things are benefiting us
100,"We didn't call it out specifically this quarter, but we're continuing to see good performance from both the absolute commission rates that we're seeing in the business as well as the mix benefits from just faster growth of our digital business that's continued to drive overall commission rates down, if you will so, that trend is continuing"
101,"Thanks, Darrin"
102,"I would say that, you know we're in the 3.5% to 4% range"
103,Some of it is just timing more than anything else
104,But we're also trying to do things as efficiently as we can you know with technology and other solutions
105,So – you know we've been stable in that 3.5% to 4% range now for the last few years
106,and you know so it's not
107,"– it's a relatively small range as you know, so that's we are still in that range"
108,Thank you
109,And the dotcom business domestically continues to do very well and accelerated slightly actually in the quarter
110,"I don't have a forecast for the spread, but some of it is continuing from the larger price reductions we had made in Argentina more than a year ago"
111,"So some of that is continuing, but overall I would just say the Latin America business is getting healthy growth across the board"
112,"Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the conditions are quite strong there"
113,We've seen stronger growth throughout that region more than we've seen in some time
114,"I'd say I think it's mostly timing, we had been messaging earlier in the year that we were under-spending in marketing"
115,And so now that's catching up with us
116,", so it's as expected from a couple of quarters ago"
117,We're launching a number of different programs on the digital side to acquire customers
118,We're also trying to create awareness at some of our other digital capabilities of paying out into accounts
119,So it really is more timing than anything else
120,Thank you
121,We don't believe that's really impacting us much
122,"Obviously, we have 50,000 locations here in the U.S"
123,"; Walmart has 4,000."
124,"Walmart, what they did most recently was they reduced an already low price"
125,And so it really remains to be seen on whether an even lower price is going to bring in more traffic into those stores
126,So we feel very good about our positioning
127,"If you look at our nation-wide pricing, it's pretty competitive to the other offerings and distribution"
128,is very strong as well
129,"So that's not really the key driver and DMT in total for us is about 7% of our total revenues, just to put that in perspective"
130,And again dotcom continues to grow really well from a DMT standpoint
131,and we saw some accelerated growth there
132,So we're well-positioned competitively
133,It's just timing
134,We have not changed our full-year outlook on the tax rate
135,"So still 10% to 11% or 12% to 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year, which is the same as we gave last time"
136,"Well, there are three pieces to the North American business that you're looking at"
137,"One is, U.S"
138,outbound and U.S
139,outbound continued to grow really well
140,We saw strong trends similar to what we saw in the prior quarter
141,and that's the largest piece
142,The U.S
143,"domestic money transfer business, the retail part of the business did see some softness both in revenue which was driven by some of the price reductions we've made, but also some transaction softness"
144,"Some of it may be related to the hurricanes, but we'll see what that impact was as we get into the fourth quarter"
145,"It's hard to know exactly how much that was, but some of it may have been from the Hurricanes"
146,And then the U.S
147,to Mexico is also part of that number and the transaction trends there were a little bit softer as well
148,"The overall market seems to be a bit softer in Mexico, that seems to be more of the impact"
149,"I mean, we'll give a view of the margins and the other components of our outlook when we go into next year, Jim"
150,But obviously we like the fact that we're getting more savings that's positive for us
151,Revenue growth is still going to be the number one driver for us in terms of where overall margins are because our cost structure is about 40% fixed
152,But we also want to look at some of the investment opportunities
153,"Our goal is to try to accelerate revenue longer term, so we do want to put some of the money back into growth opportunities"
154,Hikmet talked about digital expansion globally
155,We want to be 200 countries to 200 countries digital to digital in our wu
156,So that requires investment
157,"So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year"
158,and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability
159,"Hey, Ashwin"
160,"Ashwin, we came into this year expecting at the higher end because of some of the joint settlement agreements and the incremental activities, so the timing of some of those things have allowed us to be at the lower end"
161,But we're continuing to invest as Hikmet said
162,Yeah
163,"I mean, part of the reduction – sorry, Ashwin, part of the reason why we are at the lower end as you heard last time, we talked about the Southwest Border activities being completed early"
164,And so that's something that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year
165,So that's one of the reasons and then other efficiencies
166,It helps
167,"Just operating efficiencies, obviously we'd rather get stronger revenue growth"
168,", that's our number one priority"
169,"But we've also been managing the bottom line in that business, just in the environment that we're in"
170,So it certainly helps
171,But our number one focus there is still to drive better top-line growth
172,There is probably some pricing that's helping us there
173,"We expected that in the second half of this year, we would start to get some grow-over benefit"
174,"Key parts of the Middle East started to decline in the second half of last year and then as we go into the fourth quarter, India, the demonetization that began in India in November of last year should start to grow over"
175,And the Middle East is a key sending region to India and so that should start to help some of the actual metrics in the Middle East and India
176,So you should start to see a little bit better grow-over impact from that as we go into the fourth quarter
177,"I don't know where it ranks, but it's still very important to – that's a very important corridor for us, Saudi to India"
178,"I don't know of its exact ranking, but clearly the top corridor for Saudi is to India"
179,About two-thirds of our transactions are initiating in our mobile app on wu
180,So if that was your question on wu
181,"com, about two-thirds of our business is originating on a mobile app"
182,and it's even higher in the U.S
183,And so we're getting very strong growth
184,and we don't have mobile everywhere yet
185,So that's really the goal is to be mobile
186,How are you?
187,"I mean, it depends on the trends that we see in other parts of our business"
188,We'll start to see some grow-over benefit as I just mentioned in certain parts of our consumer business
189,We've continued to see good strong trends in our digital business
190,"And our bill payments businesses have been doing quite well, both Speedpay as well as Pago Facil"
191,"So those are really the key drivers of growth, both from a constant currency and a reported standpoint and then of course currency is helping us from a reported standpoint"
192,"It can, it can"
193,"Over the long term, probably not, but in the short term, if there are extreme moves in currencies, then customers may change their behavior at times"
194,"When we saw the Indian rupee weaken some time ago or when we've seen the peso, we've seen a large influx of business into those markets"
195,So currency moves in the short term can certainly have an impact on consumer behavior
196,"Yeah, the way we look at the Mastercard partnership and paying out here domestically, it's really just another channel to deliver our services"
197,"We have dotcom today originating transactions which largely pay out on retail, this gives us the opportunity to pay out to all debit cards in the United States, and including Mastercard debit card"
198,"So, we'll have to see, we don't really have any projections to give you on that, because we just, we expect it to launch early next year"
199,Thank you
200,"No, the realized savings this year will be $25 million and we'll have an incremental $25 million next year realized"
201,So total realized savings next year of $50 million
202,"Well, the $95 million of WU Way expenses that we're incurring this year will go away at the end of this year"
203,"So the programs themselves we may continue, but we're not going to have the spending next year, so it's zero"
204,"Yeah, we've tried to call it out separately for GAAP margins and adjusted margins, just so you can see the difference that that's making"
