3,"Gross margin was 69.5%, at the high end of our guidance, due primarily to favorable end market mix"

37,We will provide full year
38,FY 2018 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting in New York City on May 22.
39,We look forward to seeing you all at that meeting
40,Let me now turn the call over to Moshe
41,Yes
42,John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
43,LLC Moshe?
44,Yeah
45,So two things
46,So I might frustrate you by not being very precise
47,"But in the comms, we do show data center"
48,We do expect data center to grow meaningfully
49,And again that's in the context of some of our older data center business not growing as much as we would like
50,"And in certain cases, our design wins that we've had were slowing down"
51,"So we do think that, in summary, that the data center growth, which is part of the overall comms growth, all the end other markets in the comms area we expect to be growing as well, but the data center growth will be driven by hyperscale"
52,"Then with regard to share count, so I haven't been providing detailed share count guidance for the past couple of quarters for a couple reasons"
53,One is I don't want to kind of signal exactly what we're doing on our buyback
54,"And the second part is, the complexity of the convert and its impact on our diluted share count is hard to describe briefly"
55,"So I would though recommend you, CJ, go to our website"
56,We're going to update what we expect to be the impact on diluted share count from the redemption of the convert in this quarter
57,"Like I said, it's fairly complex, but we've tried to make it understandable"
58,"And you will see that it will have a significant impact in this current fiscal quarter, and then because of the way the accounting is done for the share count, it will actually even translate to a further reduction in the next quarter"
59,"So I mean, I will actually, I'm happy to take a follow-up if there's something"
60,"specifically you were looking for, but I'm not going to give you a precise share count guide"
61,"That was a very artfully phrased question, too"
62,Good for that
63,"It's generally been on an upward trend as design wins that we have, one in our 28-nanometer generation ramp in"
64,"As you know, in defense, it's a very, very long-tailed business"
65,"So at any point one time, we have multiple generations, multiple of our product generations being sold into the industry"
66,"So given our competitive position and strength of design wins and our continued design wins in large opportunities like Joint Strike Fighter, we feel very good about the business"
67,"So I think an element of your question, Blayne, was maybe related to whether the applications on AWS are kind of nichy or small or whether there's some big entities using it"
68,"And the launch partners range obviously from some smaller entities to some very large entities, and they're doing a range of applications that are fundamental to each of the companies in the core businesses"
69,So I do think the scaling opportunity is there and very well represented
70,So the industrial A&D softness is due to program-specific things in defense primarily
71,The rest of the business areas are relatively going to be flat relatively quarter on quarter
72,"In the automotive, consumer, broadcast space, as we've mentioned in this call already, we've set a record in automotive"
73,"And if you go back a quarter, we talked about kind of a low based on some inventory things"
74,So we're going to see a little bit of dip in automotive
75,"And by the way, though we expect a longer-term trend upward based on the strength of our ADAS design wins, we won't be surprised by some quarterly fluctuations"
76,"But underneath that, the ADAS business is very strong"
77,It's just kind of a quarterly correction and the rest of the end markets in that segment are flat
78,"We will probably talk a little bit more in May about longer-term trends in audio/video broadcast, but you're right, the industry is facing some headwinds, and we are feeling those as well"
79,"Chris, we'll, like all the other questions that relate to longer-term views on the business, we'll talk about that more in our Analyst Meeting"
