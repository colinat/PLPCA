4,"HUMIRA had another outstanding quarter, with global sales of $4.7 billion, up 14.9% operationally"
5,"This performance is reflective of continued strong demand, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as anti-TNF biosimilars"
6,", HUMIRA sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by low double-digit prescription growth plus price"
7,"Wholesaler inventory levels were below half a month, as is our standard practice"
8,"HUMIRA's growth continues to be fueled by robust demand across all three segments, rheum, gastro and derm, and market share remains stable despite competitive dynamics"
9,"Internationally, HUMIRA had an exceptional quarter, with operational sales growth of 9.1%"
10,"This performance was driven by market growth as well as tender timing, which contributed nearly 2 percentage points to operational sales growth in the quarter"
11,"Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the second quarter were $626 million, up more than 42% over the second quarter of last year"
12,", which totaled $528 million in the quarter, were driven by our strong market positions in CLL as well as other indications, including mantle cell lymphoma, WaldenstrÃ¶m's and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which was approved earlier this year"
13,"Global Viekira sales in the quarter were $225 million, down versus the prior year"
14,"In the coming weeks, we expect U.S"
15,"and European regulatory decisions for our next-generation HCV treatment, MAVIRET"
16,Based on the timing of reimbursement decisions outside the U.S
17,and managed-care contracting cycles in the U.S
18,", we expect to see meaningful sales contribution from MAVIRET starting in 2018."
19,"Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 16% on an operational basis in the quarter"
20,"And we also saw strong growth from Creon, which was up over 9% in the quarter"
21,"Reviewing the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 82.3% of sales compared to 81.9% in the prior year"
22,This was inclusive of 80 basis points of dilutive impact related to partnership accounting
23,"Adjusted R&D was 17.5% of sales, up 200 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased funding of the pipeline, including incremental spend associated with the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions"
24,"Adjusted SG&A was 20.2% of sales in the quarter, down 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies"

27,"Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.42, up 12.7% year-over-year"
28,"Turning to full year guidance, we continue to forecast full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54 per share, representing growth of 13.9% at the midpoint"
29,This guidance comprehends full year top-line operational growth approaching 10%
30,"HUMIRA, we continue to expect mid to high teens sales growth for the full year"
31,"Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA"
32,"Given recent foreign exchange dynamics, we would expect full year reported sales growth for international HUMIRA to approach mid-single digits"
33,"For IMBRUVICA, we remain on track to achieve our full year expectation for global reported revenues of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S"
34,of more than $2 billion
35,"In the last several weeks, we have seen a weakening of the dollar versus key foreign currencies"
36,"If these rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would forecast no material impact from foreign exchange to full year sales"
37,"This currency movement would, however, have an adverse impact on gross margin due to hedges in place on key currencies"
38,"If exchange were to hold at current rates, we would forecast full year gross margin as a percentage of sales at 80.5%"
39,"We are forecasting full year R&D expense approaching 17.5% of sales, reflecting pipeline funding and the impacts of the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions"
40,"We expect SG&A of over 20.5% of sales, and this would result in an operating margin profile of approximately 42.5%, inclusive of the recent impact of currency movements"
41,We continue to expect a net interest expense of approximately $1 billion
42,And the adjusted tax rate for the full year should be modeled at above 19%
43,"For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.36 and $1.38."
44,This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.22 of non-cash amortization and other specified items and represents year-over-year growth of 13.2% at the midpoint
45,We are forecasting operational revenue growth of approximately 9% through the third quarter
46,"And if current exchange rates hold, no impact from exchange on sales in the quarter"
47,"HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the third quarter in the high teens"
48,"Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA"
49,"For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S"
50,sales growth in the third quarter of approximately 30%
51,We expect gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 80.5% of sales
52,This gross margin comprehends current exchange rates and is inclusive of the dilutive impact of partnered products
53,"In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the quarter, driven by our focus on strong commercial and operational execution"
54,"We expect to continue this momentum in the second half of 2017, putting us in a great position to deliver top-tier revenue and EPS growth for the full year"
55,"And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz"
56,"So, Marc, yeah, it was a nice quarter for gross margin"
57,We've gone back and looked
58,"Historically, Q2 does run a little stronger than the rest of the year"
59,"That's a function of product mix, to a certain extent"
60,"But that said, we continue to make pretty nice progress on this line, even in the face of the partnership accounting"
61,"If you back out partnership accounting, we are probably up about 120 basis points"
62,"Yeah, I think the main drivers, about a third of that was a favorable impact of exchange"
63,"But that still left 80 basis points to the good, and that was really a mix of product mix as well as just cost efficiencies"
64,The royalty burden really lifts in two different phases
65,"The first third of it lifts at the very end of 2017, so you see a P&L impact in 2018."
66,The other two-thirds lifts at the very end of 2018
67,", so you see the P&L benefit in 2019."
68,"And then in terms of quantity to model, we have said that that burden is about 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales"
