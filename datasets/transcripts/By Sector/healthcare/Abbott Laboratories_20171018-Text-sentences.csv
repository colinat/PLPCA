1,"Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.66 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth"
2,"We also raised midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.48 to $2.50 which is at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year"
3,Sales increased more than [technical difficulty] in the quarter led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices
4,"At the beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where innovation and new product launches when enhance our competitiveness and fortify our leading market positions"
5,We're seeing this play out through the first three quarters of the year with significant growth contributions from several recently launched products and important advancements across our innovative new product pipeline
6,I'll highlight several examples as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian
7,I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of more than 5% in the quarter which was led by strong international performance during the quarter
8,"We continued the initial European launch of our Alinity family of systems, which now includes five recently launched instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening, hematology and Point of Care testing"
9,"As we've stated previously, our primary focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of long tenured Abbott customers to Alinity and we continue to make progress on that front across all of the major European countries"
10,We continue to anticipate CE Mark for our Alinity molecular diagnostic systems in the coming months and expect to begin the launch of the Alinity instruments in the US in 2018.
11,"During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Alere establishing Abbott, is the global leader in Point of Care testing"
12,"This combination creates the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio in the world with leading positions across cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing"
13,"In nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter"
14,And pediatric nutrition continued above market performance and the US was led by recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand
15,"Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China and we prepare for the pending new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect on January 1 of next year"
16,"Outside of China as expected, we continue to see soft market conditions across few international markets and then adult nutrition international growth of 5.5% was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands"
17,"In established pharmaceuticals or EPD double-digit sales growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets including double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China"
18,"As expected and contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that country on July 1, which contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter excluding this impact total EPD sales would have grown around 12% in the quarter"
19,"With our unique geographic footprint and business model as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above market performance"
20,"And in medical devices sales growth was led by double-digit growth in heart failure, electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care"
21,In addition to strong growth we achieved several important new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during the third quarter
22,"In heart failure, we received US FDA approval and launched our HeartMate 3 pump which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure patients as they wait for their treatment including heart transplants"
23,HeartMate 3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options and further strengthens our global leadership position in this area
24,"During the quarter, we also received US FDA approval of our MRI compatible ICD or implantable defibrillator which follows FDA approval of our MRI compatible pacemaker earlier this year"
25,These approvals significantly enhance our competitive position in the US Cardiac Rhythm Management market
26,"In structural heart, double-digit growth was driven by continued global uptick MitraClip"
27,"During the quarter we achieved several important clinical milestones including completion of enrolment in our US trial for Portico, our TAVR product and we began enrolling patients in a new tricuspid valve disease trial which utilizes our market leading transcatheter valve repair system"
28,"In Neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50% for the third consecutive quarter driven by recently launched products that offer improved relief for chronic pain patients and help for those suffering from movement disorders"
29,"With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we continue to advance our leadership position in this fast growing market"
30,"I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where international sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks"
31,"Libre now has more than 400,000 users internationally and during the quarter we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom which represent two of the largest diabetes markets in the world"
32,"In the US during the quarter, Libre received US FDA approval as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring"
33,This revolutionary technology is the only system available that comes factory-calibrated thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks that are required to calibrate other systems currently available
34,"So in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance which is now at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year"
35,Our sales growth increased sequentially and recently launched products are contributing significant growth across our portfolio and we're particularly pleased with the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline which is delivering a study cadence of approvals and launches of innovative technologies
36,I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more details
37,"Yes, I think it's premature Mike to give real specific about Alere"
38,"We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago, literally"
39,"And our new management team is taking over the business, but obviously very rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees and going through all the things you do to start integration and so forth"
40,"And I'd say first of all, that's gone very well"
41,"The management team we put in place has moved very quickly and I'd say very deliberately to get their hands around everything, but that takes some time"
42,"As we've said the people given the timing of when we close it, we expect no accretion this year"
43,"So I wouldn't look for any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017 and with regard to 2018, since our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know when we first announced this deal because it's taken a very long time close"
44,There have been a number of changes including divestitures and so forth
45,So I don't want to give you a specific number
46,I'd say it's fair to think that the accretion will be much more modest and what we have initially indicated for the first year
47,"We will get a full year, we'll get a quarter's head start"
48,And obviously our intent is to be accretive to our company and our business
49,"and we believe that with the acquisition we've positioned ourselves as the leader in Point of Care testing worldwide and all of that has the intent of good solid growth and profit growth for our investors, but I'm going to be cautious about what I communicate for 2018 at this point until we've really had a chance to assess it more thoroughly"
50,I think it's a good target
51,"I don't know that we know yet, but that's certainly"
52,"I think an expectation we Abbott ought to have and the question is, how rapidly we can do that"
53,Look I think it's a fair expectation
54,and if I was
55,and I'm totally honest with you
56,I wouldn't have a lesser expectation
57,Well I'd say couple of things
58,Your estimate is - let's just say your estimate I'll take
59,"And you gave me a nice range there, so thank you"
60,And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at this from a lot of perspectives because we've got a lot of data
61,"Having had a run rate in Europe, we launched in Europe and it basically went country-by-country"
62,We started as full patient pay and we had really terrific uptake in consumer interest and that was the first introduction of Libre to the market
63,"The fact that there was no reimbursement early on, was an unknown to us and it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test"
64,And we experienced tremendous demand
65,"Our first year, we were capacity limited and yet, we had a fair bit of demand"
66,"Second year, obviously has gone exceptionally well and so as I indicated we've got over 400,000 customers"
67,It was remarkably well embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and regions in Germany etc
68,", that's extremely gratifying that the value proposition that we see with Libre is strong and it's intended to be"
69,"And consequently we believe that part of the appeal is not just, what Libre can do and the information that it provides to a diabetic was a very informed patient and a very self-managing patient"
70,"It provides them tremendous information, tremendous guidance in the management of diabetes"
71,"and I know that first-hand, I wear one"
72,And I got to say it's just a phenomenal device
73,", it's a super product"
74,I can see why consumers like it as much as they do and that's true for both Type I and Type II's
75,"and we're seeing that universally across the board, they use it in different ways or at least the information mean something to them in different ways"
76,Whether they're managing insulin or whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things
77,"So I'd say first of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong"
78,"Secondly, the US market knows about Libre, it knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that we've had in the last year in Europe"
79,"So I do expect a more educated, ready, prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the US as it relates to payers, which I would call the second dimension of this"
80,I think our value proposition is quite strong
81,The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level
82,The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as possible
83,And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to competitive offerings
84,and I think that's going to be making it strong
85,We are in discussions with payers and we're in discussion with payers about that value proposition
86,and I believe that will all go very well
87,"I know that's not as much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much I'm willing to share at this point because right now I would tell you we expect a good strong out of the block performance like you described and beyond that"
88,"I mean right now, Mike we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter"
89,"and that's across a continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system at a time"
90,"Of course the US is quite large, and Japan and UK as additions to this are also quite large"
91,"So I mean, we have a fair amount of optimism and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves"
92,"Yes, I'd say a couple things Matt"
93,First of all let me back up and give a bigger context to this
94,"Over the course of the year, there was a lot of scepticism on the part of analyst end or investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished, that were back end loaded"
95,"A lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things and depending on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting and we all know everything doesn't go right"
96,And the Sylmar inspection put some of that in doubt
97,"Now having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim approvals, licensure approvals and so forth"
98,And the third quarter alone here has been pretty gratifying in that
99,"We basically got every approval we forecasted and let's call it, within 30 days or so of what we forecasted and I think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened and that includes Libre, that includes the high voltage MRI claim, that includes HeartMate, it includes the closure of Alere"
100,", it includes Libre, it includes lot of things"
101,"I don't generally like being backend loaded because it feels like a lot of risk that everything has to go right, but everything did"
102,And our progress with Sylmar is no exception as I've indicated on prior calls
103,"Our team that has been working with the Sylmar team and so forth has done an exceptional job that we have provided all information, taken all actions, done all remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FDA, discussed with FDA etc"
104,"And at this point and we're just experiencing those new systems populating with new experience, new data, new decision making etc"
105,"and all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted, exactly as communicated with the FDA and thus far without a hiccup"
106,and I think that's recognized by the FDA
107,"I think it's recognized, they have discretion, they don't have to license new products out of that facility, but they have"
108,And I think that is evidence of how we're progressing with Sylmar and the fact that the FDA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would and should and what we've submitted to them for approval has been given fair and objective consideration and we've gotten our approval so far
109,"With that said, the remaining ones, I'm not going to change my estimates on"
110,I'm not going to change what we forecasted
111,I have no reason to believe otherwise
112,"They clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience and"
113,so consequently I remain optimistically that we're on track that we'll deliver what we said
114,Well I'll tell you
115,"what, I'm not sure"
116,I would tell you this
117,"First of all, we have product approvals we need"
118,We're ready for the transition
119,Building inventory for such etc
120,So as far as responding to the new law
121,and I think this is true for at least the large multinational competitors
122,"I think most of us, if not all of us have our product approvals"
123,We are ready for the transition etc
124,"How we all manage that, who knows"
125,But I think at least we are
126,"and I think others are, ready with new approved replacement products"
127,etc
128,as we've been required to do
129,So I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1.
130,"What you can't know very well, at least about everybody else is how much inventory everybody has in various channels?"
131,How long that transition will take for any given competitor and so forth
132,We are comfortable with our inventory levels were comfortable with our inventory levels both on current product and post January 1 product
133,So we're comfortable what we think we have to do with our own transition
134,"What's hard to project is not just multinationals, but all the hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are faced with the same regulation"
135,So I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China
136,", it hasn't been as choppy as it was in the last two years"
137,I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin down
138,We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen
139,The market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believed or better than we thought
140,"and we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of our market data because there are many and they're not all perfectly comprehensive across all channels and then all sources of products or even all geography, so"
141,it's a hard win
142,"China is a particularly difficult one to pin down because there are a number of channels, there are a lot of competitors, there are a lot of data sources, it's not like going to AC Nielsen in the US or something"
143,So I'm cautious about it
144,I think we've seen the tough part
145,"and I think we're going back into a phase where it's the same kind of hand-to-hand competition, we've always had across multiple channels, I like that"
146,"I think that's better because at least then whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our execution, I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution"
147,"and I don't exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but"
148,I also see less than great execution on our part
149,So this business is getting a lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom and it will get some attention
150,I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release
151,That make a lot of things you know are going awfully well as I just commented to you in the device area
152,But this one is going to get a lot more attention
153,I feel that China is at least reasonably stable or predictable
154,We haven't been right about the market growth rates
155,"Those looked better than we expected, so that's a plus"
156,and I guess I would just leave it at there
157,"Yes, I expect it to be accretive"
158,"We've got a lot of work to do, to identify our synergies and identify growth opportunities"
159,We're going through reorganization of the business right now
160,and I think that's actually going to be a plus
161,I don't want to describe how it was organized because I think that's kind of waste of time
162,"and it will take a long time, but we went through a restructuring of the old structure of St"
163,Jude and
164,"we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable"
165,"The restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as far as people go, we've gone through, changes and management"
166,we've gone through etc
167,But about the six month level at St
168,Jude it all got done in Alere in six days
169,So that's a running start
170,And we've announced what we're moving to
171,", I think it's an organization like all organizations all people want to do well"
172,"They want to achieve, they want to grow, they want to be proud of the businesses they're running, they want to do well"
173,"and I'd say, our early days with the employees of Alere have been positive and we announced that we're going to go to that kind of structure"
174,", we've announced how we're going to do it, why we're going to do it etc"
175,and I think that's well received at this point
176,"So as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about was half of that, a good placeholder"
177,"I'd say, yes it's a good placeholder"
178,"I can't tell you with any precision that that's what it will be, but I think it's a good placeholder"
179,"Well couple of things, first of all with regard to Sierra the same schedule, no change that will be first quarter of the year, we think"
180,"And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved already"
181,"As you may understand it gets approved in pieces and so far, so good"
182,"There are some peripheral pieces we're waiting for approval on, but the first and very critical portion of that is approved"
183,So yes I think that's -
184,so far everything we've seen is very encouraging and no change
185,"Well right now, that's what I bet on"
186,I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative to you
187,"Look, we got our acquisitions closed"
188,We're going to have a number of product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that obviously should hit their stride
189,I mean ideally you look at 2018
190,and you'd like to have your product approvals
191,"exactly where we got them, going into next year"
192,"We've had a really good 2017, we beat all expectations not just in the numbers, but in the approvals"
193,"You all have to admit you had a lot of scepticism about some of this and maybe rightly so after 2016, but look we hit every target, we had for this and with all those approvals, one ought to think that, should bode positively for 2018."
194,"That said, when we go through our budgeting every year"
195,"it's kind of negotiating tussle with our managers around the world, about what's possible in their given market and so forth"
196,But I think we ought to have pretty good momentum going into 2018
197,"What can I say, all the organic R&D projects and system projects and launches and approvals and"
198,"so forth, they're all happening"
199,"And the Alinity products probably most miraculously five of those began their launch process in Europe and they'll start in the US next year, that's been a huge, huge undertaking"
200,", we're extremely excited about Libre, we're excited about all the medical device products, everything that St"
201,Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has come to fruition and is coming to fruition and
202,"so, we're very, very bullish about all that"
203,And I think we're -
204,and I think there is an awful lot of validation in this about that acquisition
205,"We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we will"
206,"And whether it's a big impact for 2018 or if it's beyond 2018, either way I think we're pretty happy to have that business"
207,"So you know Rick, I think your assessment is right"
208,"It'd be kind of hard for me to say, no it's going to be a tough year"
209,"Okay, well first I'd tell you that, this got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVP's and SVP's from day one"
210,"and I'm going to let him answer that question because they've exceeded all of our targets not just by a little, but a lot"
211,The cash flow is strong and I'll let him tell you that
212,I think [indiscernible] commercial out there
213,This all gets even better if there is tax reforms
214,I wouldn't put odds on any more than anybody else watching our government
215,but we're extremely hopeful of the territorial system that
216,"and it gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate and that does make it difference to us, in addressing current debt and cash flow, but cash flow itself, super good"
217,I would comment a couple of things
218,"First of all, it was a strange quarter for us in that, multiple hurricanes whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across the Puerto Rico impacted, anybody who had operations there"
219,The earthquake in Mexico impacted us
220,The brush fires and forced fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed Alere
221,had a key Alere facility there
222,"And to be honest, it was more impact on our employees than on our plant operations"
223,"We had a little bit of roof damage and a little water leakage here and there, but it would appear the hurricane effected different companies, different ways going across Puerto Rico because I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than we've experienced"
224,"It took up a super human effort by a lot of our people to try to address some of that, which we did"
225,The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico and our folks address that really rapidly
226,and we're very happy about that
227,"Our plants, I guess back up and running, is the right way to say it"
228,There is one that we're starting this week
229,"and we're back up, is what it amounts to"
230,And so there is -
231,"I would call it a modest impact, it affected us, I'd say in a modest level, not a material level"
232,"Our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which we've done"
233,"And so in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of disruption that some others have"
234,"I noted that, another large healthcare company yesterday I think had similar comments that they've been able to address it"
235,"We're kind of large in Puerto Rico, so it could have been worse, but it wasn't and the St"
236,Jude facilities that we inherited there with the acquisition
237,"Jude were not particularly impacted, I mean they were but not to the degree we might have expected"
238,I mean everything is been more about power generation than damage
239,And unfortunately that's not true for our employees and it's not true for some other competitors
240,and I wouldn't wish that on anybody
241,But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and running
242,So we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates
243,The facility that was threatened in California was not damaged
244,"We were able to move things out of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage"
245,and so we'll be back up and running soon
246,", we did have employees who unfortunately lost homes and so forth"
247,and we're dealing with that as a company
248,"But from the standpoint of the operation of the business, we are in good shape relatively speaking and to the extent that there is any impact, we've already included in our estimates for this quarter and absorbed it"
249,"Okay, I'm going to have Scott answer that one for you"
250,It's gratifying that our experience with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth
251,So I think that bodes well for the ICD as well
252,"Well let me answer it, this way"
253,I don't really want the organization focused on M&A right now
254,I think I would give you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so forth
255,"And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights"
256,"Most of the - my experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been you liked to have some indication on what's coming, usually that surprised you more acquisitions or other things that we've done that hasn't always been particularly well received"
257,"but they've always turned out pretty well, but I generally don't like the forecast where we're going or what we're doing until we announce it"
258,and so I probably wouldn't tell you anyway
259,Glen Novarro
260,But is there some powder [ph] for next year or is next year really let's focus on St
261,"Jude, let's focus on Alere, before we think about anything else"
262,Honestly I think there is focus on St
263,Jude and Alere and right now that is paying off
264,Look the focus on St
265,"Jude it's clearly paying off, the focus on Alere will pay off"
266,"The focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things will pay off"
267,These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth
268,"I mean it's the hallmark and the identity of the company is sustained growth and we target double-digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance both in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance etc"
269,"has to be sustainable that is where the focus is, and we've acquired a couple of businesses that initially were criticized that's not growth"
270,and I beg to differ
271,and I think that we're demonstrating so far with St
272,"Jude that there is a terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, etc"
273,and I think you can see that
274,"You can see that in the initial couple of quarters here, so yes I think there is going to be a lot of focus on not just St"
275,"Jude and Alere, but the fundamental organic performance of all of our businesses"
276,You know it took a while for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in established pharma
277,and I think it sort of called out that there is a segment of pharma that's not commodity generic
278,", that's branded generic, that's higher margin, higher growth, etc"
279,in pretty key markets around the world and right now that's our fastest growing business other than neuromod
280,"And neuromod's hard to touch, but we're growing that business at double digits"
281,The team is doing a terrific job
282,Those markets represent the kind of opportunity we said they did and those kinds of growths from an operating standpoint growth rates out of the business that's what you want
283,"So to some point if we can add to our footprint and add to our strategies, we want to be in a flexible position to do that"
284,"We obviously want to get to a position where we have the strategic flexibility that we always felt we had, so I don't think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations"
285,"Keep pushing our cash flow, keep pushing that debt down"
286,So that's where the focus will be next year
287,and I think we get ourselves back to
288,"strategic flexibility quicker that way, which is a good thing"
289,Glen Novarro
290,Yes
291,Okay
292,"and then just I agree with everything you said,"
293,just some housekeeping
294,Maybe for Scott
295,"You said Portico you finished in ruling next to US trial, would that put you on pace for 2019"
296,US launch
297,And then I think you talked about Mitro [ph] which is the Tendyne program
298,"and I think you said you started enrolling, is that enrolling in the European trial and then is there an update on the start of the US trial?"
299,Thanks
300,I'm going let Scott answer that
301,"It's a really good to know, that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and so forth"
302,"and we've been able to combine these things, with St"
303,"Jude in a way I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable"
304,so we're pretty excited about that one
305,Glen Novarro
306,Any update on when you start the US trial for Tendyne?
307,I mean I think anybody that claimed
308,"50% growth rate was sustainable will be an idiot, but so I'm not going to be one"
309,Look we're very pleased with the performance in Neuromod
310,"I think it's obviously driven by the fact, we've got three great products there"
311,They're being exceptionally well received by the market
312,They have an impact in real life on patients in their P&L levels
313,We're seeing great with real world results from Burst and DRG
314,I think it's a really great group of products and a strong organization
315,I think the products hit a segment that's in kind need of improvements for patients and particularly the time when pain drugs and so forth are a national issue
316,So I don't know
317,", I think the new products are driving the growth and the execution is been strong, the uptick is been strong"
318,"We've got three quarters in a row, 50% better growth"
319,How long will it be like that?
320,"[Indiscernible] lap it, with all big numbers we'll start to diminish the growth rate, but the actual raw growth will still be pretty strong,"
321,so I don't know
322,", I like what we see"
323,"but it's hard for me to hold it up with an example to all the other business, so you should do this"
