Okay
Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.66 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth
We also raised midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.48 to $2.50 which is at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year
Sales increased more than [technical difficulty] in the quarter led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices
At the beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where innovation and new product launches when enhance our competitiveness and fortify our leading market positions
We're seeing this play out through the first three quarters of the year with significant growth contributions from several recently launched products and important advancements across our innovative new product pipeline
I'll highlight several examples as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian
I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of more than 5% in the quarter which was led by strong international performance during the quarter
We continued the initial European launch of our Alinity family of systems, which now includes five recently launched instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening, hematology and Point of Care testing
As we've stated previously, our primary focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of long tenured Abbott customers to Alinity and we continue to make progress on that front across all of the major European countries
We continue to anticipate CE Mark for our Alinity molecular diagnostic systems in the coming months and expect to begin the launch of the Alinity instruments in the US in 2018. During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Alere establishing Abbott, is the global leader in Point of Care testing
This combination creates the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio in the world with leading positions across cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing
In nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter
And pediatric nutrition continued above market performance and the US was led by recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand
Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China and we prepare for the pending new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect on January 1 of next year
Outside of China as expected, we continue to see soft market conditions across few international markets and then adult nutrition international growth of 5.5% was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands
In established pharmaceuticals or EPD double-digit sales growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets including double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China
As expected and contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that country on July 1, which contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter excluding this impact total EPD sales would have grown around 12% in the quarter
With our unique geographic footprint and business model as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above market performance
And in medical devices sales growth was led by double-digit growth in heart failure, electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care
In addition to strong growth we achieved several important new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during the third quarter
In heart failure, we received US FDA approval and launched our HeartMate 3 pump which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure patients as they wait for their treatment including heart transplants
HeartMate 3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options and further strengthens our global leadership position in this area
During the quarter, we also received US FDA approval of our MRI compatible ICD or implantable defibrillator which follows FDA approval of our MRI compatible pacemaker earlier this year
These approvals significantly enhance our competitive position in the US Cardiac Rhythm Management market
In structural heart, double-digit growth was driven by continued global uptick MitraClip
During the quarter we achieved several important clinical milestones including completion of enrolment in our US trial for Portico, our TAVR product and we began enrolling patients in a new tricuspid valve disease trial which utilizes our market leading transcatheter valve repair system
In Neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50% for the third consecutive quarter driven by recently launched products that offer improved relief for chronic pain patients and help for those suffering from movement disorders
With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we continue to advance our leadership position in this fast growing market
I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where international sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks
Libre now has more than 400,000 users internationally and during the quarter we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom which represent two of the largest diabetes markets in the world
In the US during the quarter, Libre received US FDA approval as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring
This revolutionary technology is the only system available that comes factory-calibrated thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks that are required to calibrate other systems currently available
So in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance which is now at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year
Our sales growth increased sequentially and recently launched products are contributing significant growth across our portfolio and we're particularly pleased with the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline which is delivering a study cadence of approvals and launches of innovative technologies
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more details
Yes, I think it's premature Mike to give real specific about Alere
We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago, literally
And our new management team is taking over the business, but obviously very rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees and going through all the things you do to start integration and so forth
And I'd say first of all, that's gone very well
The management team we put in place has moved very quickly and I'd say very deliberately to get their hands around everything, but that takes some time
As we've said the people given the timing of when we close it, we expect no accretion this year
So I wouldn't look for any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017 and with regard to 2018, since our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know when we first announced this deal because it's taken a very long time close
There have been a number of changes including divestitures and so forth
So I don't want to give you a specific number
I'd say it's fair to think that the accretion will be much more modest and what we have initially indicated for the first year
We will get a full year, we'll get a quarter's head start
And obviously our intent is to be accretive to our company and our business and we believe that with the acquisition we've positioned ourselves as the leader in Point of Care testing worldwide and all of that has the intent of good solid growth and profit growth for our investors, but I'm going to be cautious about what I communicate for 2018 at this point until we've really had a chance to assess it more thoroughly
I think it's a good target
I don't know that we know yet, but that's certainly I think an expectation we Abbott ought to have and the question is, how rapidly we can do that
Look I think it's a fair expectation and if I was and I'm totally honest with you
I wouldn't have a lesser expectation
Well I'd say couple of things
Your estimate is - let's just say your estimate I'll take
And you gave me a nice range there, so thank you
And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at this from a lot of perspectives because we've got a lot of data
Having had a run rate in Europe, we launched in Europe and it basically went country-by-country
We started as full patient pay and we had really terrific uptake in consumer interest and that was the first introduction of Libre to the market
The fact that there was no reimbursement early on, was an unknown to us and it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test
And we experienced tremendous demand
Our first year, we were capacity limited and yet, we had a fair bit of demand
Second year, obviously has gone exceptionally well and so as I indicated we've got over 400,000 customers
It was remarkably well embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and regions in Germany etc
, that's extremely gratifying that the value proposition that we see with Libre is strong and it's intended to be
And consequently we believe that part of the appeal is not just, what Libre can do and the information that it provides to a diabetic was a very informed patient and a very self-managing patient
It provides them tremendous information, tremendous guidance in the management of diabetes and I know that first-hand, I wear one
And I got to say it's just a phenomenal device, it's a super product
I can see why consumers like it as much as they do and that's true for both Type I and Type II's and we're seeing that universally across the board, they use it in different ways or at least the information mean something to them in different ways
Whether they're managing insulin or whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things
So I'd say first of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong
Secondly, the US market knows about Libre, it knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that we've had in the last year in Europe
So I do expect a more educated, ready, prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the US as it relates to payers, which I would call the second dimension of this
I think our value proposition is quite strong
The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level
The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as possible
And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to competitive offerings and I think that's going to be making it strong
We are in discussions with payers and we're in discussion with payers about that value proposition and I believe that will all go very well
I know that's not as much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much I'm willing to share at this point because right now I would tell you we expect a good strong out of the block performance like you described and beyond that
I mean right now, Mike we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter and that's across a continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system at a time
Of course the US is quite large, and Japan and UK as additions to this are also quite large
So I mean, we have a fair amount of optimism and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves
Yes, I'd say a couple things Matt
First of all let me back up and give a bigger context to this
Over the course of the year, there was a lot of scepticism on the part of analyst end or investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished, that were back end loaded
A lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things and depending on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting and we all know everything doesn't go right
And the Sylmar inspection put some of that in doubt
Now having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim approvals, licensure approvals and so forth
And the third quarter alone here has been pretty gratifying in that
We basically got every approval we forecasted and let's call it, within 30 days or so of what we forecasted and I think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened and that includes Libre, that includes the high voltage MRI claim, that includes HeartMate, it includes the closure of Alere, it includes Libre, it includes lot of things
I don't generally like being backend loaded because it feels like a lot of risk that everything has to go right, but everything did
And our progress with Sylmar is no exception as I've indicated on prior calls
Our team that has been working with the Sylmar team and so forth has done an exceptional job that we have provided all information, taken all actions, done all remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FDA, discussed with FDA etc
And at this point and we're just experiencing those new systems populating with new experience, new data, new decision making etc
and all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted, exactly as communicated with the FDA and thus far without a hiccup and I think that's recognized by the FDA
I think it's recognized, they have discretion, they don't have to license new products out of that facility, but they have
And I think that is evidence of how we're progressing with Sylmar and the fact that the FDA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would and should and what we've submitted to them for approval has been given fair and objective consideration and we've gotten our approval so far
With that said, the remaining ones, I'm not going to change my estimates on
I'm not going to change what we forecasted
I have no reason to believe otherwise
They clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience and so consequently I remain optimistically that we're on track that we'll deliver what we said
Well I'll tell you what, I'm not sure
I would tell you this
First of all, we have product approvals we need
We're ready for the transition
Building inventory for such etc
So as far as responding to the new law and I think this is true for at least the large multinational competitors
I think most of us, if not all of us have our product approvals
We are ready for the transition etc
How we all manage that, who knows
But I think at least we are and I think others are, ready with new approved replacement products etc
as we've been required to do
So I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1. What you can't know very well, at least about everybody else is how much inventory everybody has in various channels? How long that transition will take for any given competitor and so forth
We are comfortable with our inventory levels were comfortable with our inventory levels both on current product and post January 1 product
So we're comfortable what we think we have to do with our own transition
What's hard to project is not just multinationals, but all the hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are faced with the same regulation
So I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China, it hasn't been as choppy as it was in the last two years
I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin down
We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen
The market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believed or better than we thought and we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of our market data because there are many and they're not all perfectly comprehensive across all channels and then all sources of products or even all geography, so it's a hard win
China is a particularly difficult one to pin down because there are a number of channels, there are a lot of competitors, there are a lot of data sources, it's not like going to AC Nielsen in the US or something
So I'm cautious about it
I think we've seen the tough part and I think we're going back into a phase where it's the same kind of hand-to-hand competition, we've always had across multiple channels, I like that
I think that's better because at least then whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our execution, I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution and I don't exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but I also see less than great execution on our part
So this business is getting a lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom and it will get some attention
I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release
That make a lot of things you know are going awfully well as I just commented to you in the device area
But this one is going to get a lot more attention
I feel that China is at least reasonably stable or predictable
We haven't been right about the market growth rates
Those looked better than we expected, so that's a plus and I guess I would just leave it at there
Yes, I expect it to be accretive
We've got a lot of work to do, to identify our synergies and identify growth opportunities
We're going through reorganization of the business right now and I think that's actually going to be a plus
I don't want to describe how it was organized because I think that's kind of waste of time and it will take a long time, but we went through a restructuring of the old structure of St
Jude and we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable
The restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as far as people go, we've gone through, changes and management we've gone through etc
But about the six month level at St
Jude it all got done in Alere in six days
So that's a running start
And we've announced what we're moving to, I think it's an organization like all organizations all people want to do well
They want to achieve, they want to grow, they want to be proud of the businesses they're running, they want to do well and I'd say, our early days with the employees of Alere have been positive and we announced that we're going to go to that kind of structure, we've announced how we're going to do it, why we're going to do it etc
and I think that's well received at this point
So as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about was half of that, a good placeholder
I'd say, yes it's a good placeholder
I can't tell you with any precision that that's what it will be, but I think it's a good placeholder
Well couple of things, first of all with regard to Sierra the same schedule, no change that will be first quarter of the year, we think
And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved already
As you may understand it gets approved in pieces and so far, so good
There are some peripheral pieces we're waiting for approval on, but the first and very critical portion of that is approved
So yes I think that's - so far everything we've seen is very encouraging and no change
Well right now, that's what I bet on
I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative to you
Look, we got our acquisitions closed
We're going to have a number of product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that obviously should hit their stride
I mean ideally you look at 2018 and you'd like to have your product approvals exactly where we got them, going into next year
We've had a really good 2017, we beat all expectations not just in the numbers, but in the approvals
You all have to admit you had a lot of scepticism about some of this and maybe rightly so after 2016, but look we hit every target, we had for this and with all those approvals, one ought to think that, should bode positively for 2018. That said, when we go through our budgeting every year it's kind of negotiating tussle with our managers around the world, about what's possible in their given market and so forth
But I think we ought to have pretty good momentum going into 2018 What can I say, all the organic R&D projects and system projects and launches and approvals and so forth, they're all happening
And the Alinity products probably most miraculously five of those began their launch process in Europe and they'll start in the US next year, that's been a huge, huge undertaking, we're extremely excited about Libre, we're excited about all the medical device products, everything that St
Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has come to fruition and is coming to fruition and so, we're very, very bullish about all that
And I think we're - and I think there is an awful lot of validation in this about that acquisition
We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we will
And whether it's a big impact for 2018 or if it's beyond 2018, either way I think we're pretty happy to have that business
So you know Rick, I think your assessment is right
It'd be kind of hard for me to say, no it's going to be a tough year
Okay, well first I'd tell you that, this got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVP's and SVP's from day one and I'm going to let him answer that question because they've exceeded all of our targets not just by a little, but a lot
The cash flow is strong and I'll let him tell you that
I think [indiscernible] commercial out there
This all gets even better if there is tax reforms
I wouldn't put odds on any more than anybody else watching our government but we're extremely hopeful of the territorial system that and it gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate and that does make it difference to us, in addressing current debt and cash flow, but cash flow itself, super good
I would comment a couple of things
First of all, it was a strange quarter for us in that, multiple hurricanes whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across the Puerto Rico impacted, anybody who had operations there
The earthquake in Mexico impacted us
The brush fires and forced fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed Alere had a key Alere facility there
And to be honest, it was more impact on our employees than on our plant operations
We had a little bit of roof damage and a little water leakage here and there, but it would appear the hurricane effected different companies, different ways going across Puerto Rico because I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than we've experienced
It took up a super human effort by a lot of our people to try to address some of that, which we did
The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico and our folks address that really rapidly and we're very happy about that
Our plants, I guess back up and running, is the right way to say it
There is one that we're starting this week and we're back up, is what it amounts to
And so there is - I would call it a modest impact, it affected us, I'd say in a modest level, not a material level
Our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which we've done
And so in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of disruption that some others have
I noted that, another large healthcare company yesterday I think had similar comments that they've been able to address it
We're kind of large in Puerto Rico, so it could have been worse, but it wasn't and the St
Jude facilities that we inherited there with the acquisition
Jude were not particularly impacted, I mean they were but not to the degree we might have expected I mean everything is been more about power generation than damage
And unfortunately that's not true for our employees and it's not true for some other competitors and I wouldn't wish that on anybody
But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and running
So we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates
The facility that was threatened in California was not damaged
We were able to move things out of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage and so we'll be back up and running soon, we did have employees who unfortunately lost homes and so forth and we're dealing with that as a company
But from the standpoint of the operation of the business, we are in good shape relatively speaking and to the extent that there is any impact, we've already included in our estimates for this quarter and absorbed it
Okay, I'm going to have Scott answer that one for you
It's gratifying that our experience with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth
So I think that bodes well for the ICD as well
Well let me answer it, this way
I don't really want the organization focused on M&A right now
I think I would give you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so forth
And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights
Most of the - my experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been you liked to have some indication on what's coming, usually that surprised you more acquisitions or other things that we've done that hasn't always been particularly well received but they've always turned out pretty well, but I generally don't like the forecast where we're going or what we're doing until we announce it and so I probably wouldn't tell you anyway
Glen Novarro But is there some powder [ph] for next year or is next year really let's focus on St
Jude, let's focus on Alere, before we think about anything else
Honestly I think there is focus on St
Jude and Alere and right now that is paying off
Look the focus on St
Jude it's clearly paying off, the focus on Alere will pay off
The focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things will pay off
These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth
I mean it's the hallmark and the identity of the company is sustained growth and we target double-digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance both in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance etc
has to be sustainable that is where the focus is, and we've acquired a couple of businesses that initially were criticized that's not growth and I beg to differ and I think that we're demonstrating so far with St
Jude that there is a terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, etc
and I think you can see that
You can see that in the initial couple of quarters here, so yes I think there is going to be a lot of focus on not just St
Jude and Alere, but the fundamental organic performance of all of our businesses
You know it took a while for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in established pharma and I think it sort of called out that there is a segment of pharma that's not commodity generic, that's branded generic, that's higher margin, higher growth, etc
in pretty key markets around the world and right now that's our fastest growing business other than neuromod
And neuromod's hard to touch, but we're growing that business at double digits
The team is doing a terrific job
Those markets represent the kind of opportunity we said they did and those kinds of growths from an operating standpoint growth rates out of the business that's what you want
So to some point if we can add to our footprint and add to our strategies, we want to be in a flexible position to do that
We obviously want to get to a position where we have the strategic flexibility that we always felt we had, so I don't think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations
Keep pushing our cash flow, keep pushing that debt down
So that's where the focus will be next year and I think we get ourselves back to strategic flexibility quicker that way, which is a good thing
Glen Novarro Yes
Okay and then just I agree with everything you said, just some housekeeping
Maybe for Scott
You said Portico you finished in ruling next to US trial, would that put you on pace for 2019 US launch
And then I think you talked about Mitro [ph] which is the Tendyne program and I think you said you started enrolling, is that enrolling in the European trial and then is there an update on the start of the US trial? Thanks
I'm going let Scott answer that
It's a really good to know, that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and so forth and we've been able to combine these things, with St
Jude in a way I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable so we're pretty excited about that one
Glen Novarro Any update on when you start the US trial for Tendyne?
I mean I think anybody that claimed 50% growth rate was sustainable will be an idiot, but so I'm not going to be one
Look we're very pleased with the performance in Neuromod
I think it's obviously driven by the fact, we've got three great products there
They're being exceptionally well received by the market
They have an impact in real life on patients in their P&L levels
We're seeing great with real world results from Burst and DRG
I think it's a really great group of products and a strong organization
I think the products hit a segment that's in kind need of improvements for patients and particularly the time when pain drugs and so forth are a national issue
So I don't know, I think the new products are driving the growth and the execution is been strong, the uptick is been strong
We've got three quarters in a row, 50% better growth
How long will it be like that? [Indiscernible] lap it, with all big numbers we'll start to diminish the growth rate, but the actual raw growth will still be pretty strong, so I don't know, I like what we see but it's hard for me to hold it up with an example to all the other business, so you should do this
