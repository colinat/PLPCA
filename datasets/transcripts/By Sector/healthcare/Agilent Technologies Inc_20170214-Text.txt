Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone
I'm pleased to announce that the Agilent team started 2017 with another strong quarter
First, we continued to deliver above-market growth
Revenues of $1.07 billion exceeded the high-end of November's guidance by $7 million and were up 4.8% on a core basis
We will dig deeper into details behind the strong performance later in the call
Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.53 for the quarter is $0.03 above the high-end of our guidance
Adjusted EPS is up 15% over the first quarter of last year
Finally, this is our eighth quarter in a row of improving profitability
Adjusted operating margin of 21.2% is up 100 basis points from Q1 of fiscal 2016. Let me now highlight the drivers behind our stronger-than-expected revenue growth
First, we are seeing some segments of the chemical & energy business growing again
Second, growth in China is a bit higher than expected
Let's take a closer look at our results by end market and business group
I'll start first with the end markets
Growth of Pharma is up 7% as expected against the top compare
Growth is being led by continued strong demand across the entire portfolio
The Pharma business is particularly strong in China and India
After seven quarters of year-over-year declines, we see chemical companies beginning to increase their purchases
However, our energy exploration refining business remains challenged
This results in overall 3% growth for our chemical & energy business
Clinical and diagnostics markets are strong with revenue up 8% year-over-year
Growth drivers include our companion diagnostics and CrossLab businesses
As expected, academia and governance is down 1% for the quarter with sustained type funding across most regions
Our food testing business is up 11% driven by China
Environmental and forensic revenue was down 1% for the quarter with strong China environmental growth being offset by weak U.S
forensic spending
Let's talk about China, a major part of the story as you heard today
Geographically, Asia, driven by China, continue to lead regional growth
Coming into 2017 we expected China to grow in the low double-digit range for the year
We expected Q1 growth rates to be lower than the full year because of the lunar new year falling in our fiscal Q1. However, we ended up delivering low double-digit growth in Q1 above our expectations
The Americas were up in mid-single digits with strength in the United States
Europe and Japan were flat
Let's turn to our business groups
The Life Sciences applied markets group delivered core revenue growth of 4% with end market strength in pharma, food and chemical & energy
Innovative new offerings such as the Infinity II LC Series and Agilent 8900 ICP-MS are driving growth
Industry trade publication, The Analytical Scientist, also recognized our innovation strength
They named the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC system as 2016's number one innovation of the year
The Agilent CrossLab Group continued its consistently strong performance with 7% growth in the quarter
Growth has held across both services and consumables
We are focused on future growth
In November we announced the opening of a new technology center in Folsom, California
This new $14 million facility reflects our investment in new microfluidic technology
This state-of-the-art microfabrication and technology facility is for the development and manufacture of a whole new generation of unique core instrument components and consumables for our customers
The new Intuvo 9000 GC components and associate supplies are the first example of this new capability now housed within Agilent
We are relentlessly focused on our customers
We are now the first in the industry to allow customers to renew their service contracts online
Our e-renewals program was just introduced in the United States with other regions to follow
Finally, the diagnostics and genomics group continue to deliver solid growth
DGG had core revenue growth of 4% in Q1, while continuing to drive improvements in their operating margin
The group delivered operating margins of 14.3% for the quarter, up 470 basis points from the year ago
Q1 marked several key milestones for our DGG business
This quarter marked the successful integration of the former Dako business onto Agilent's system and infrastructure platform
We closed the acquisition of Multiplicom, a leading European diagnostics company with state-of-the-art genetic testing technology and products
Multiplicom's solutions enable clinical labs to identify DNA variance, associated genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy
With this acquisition, along with the Cartagenia acquisition in 2015, we continue to expend our genomics platform
We launched Cartagenia Bench Lab 5.0. This is a major software revision providing more capabilities to the platform of choice for higher throughput diagnostics labs to help them validate and automate the results
You may recall we developed in concert with Merck the PD-1 companion diagnostic from Merck's KEYTRUDA drug
The use of this companion diagnostic continues to grow as KEYTRUDA has become a first line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer in a growing number of geographies, now including Europe
Our tests help identify potential candidates for Merck's KEYTRUDA drug which targets patients with non-small cell lung cancer
Turning to our updated FY 2017 market and company outlook, we were quite pleased with how the company started 2017. While still early in the year, the Q1 results in China and some segments of the chemical & energy markets are encouraging
We do see continued challenged conditions in the academia and government market in most geographies, as well as the global energy segment of the chemical and energy market
We also anticipate continued weak economic conditions in Europe and Japan
These cautions aside, we are encouraged by the company's growth prospects and raise our full-year core revenue growth expectations
Didier will share the details
Before I turn the call over to Didier, let me close by making a few comments on where we have come from and where we are going
Our leadership team that was put in place almost 24 months ago is delivering on our promise to increase shareholder value
We are outgrowing the market in sometimes challenging economic circumstances
For eight quarters in a row, we have delivered improved profitability
We are deploying our capital in a balanced manner, with Q1 stock repurchases of $111 million, cash dividends of $42 million, and $70 million set aside for the Multiplicom acquisition
Having built momentum, we are facing the future with confidence
We have a deep commitment to customers, a strong team, and a belief that we can deliver a superior customer experience and exceptional innovative new offerings
I look forward to answering your questions later in the call, and I will now hand off to Didier
Didier will provide additional insights on our Q1 results and updated guidance
Didier?
Hey, Paul
I'm going to start off with a good afternoon from California, and I'm going to pass it over to Didier
No
Actually I'd say the flow – and again, I just want to clarify
I hope it came through clear in my remarks
It really was the chemical side, the chemical energy, and we saw the order flow consistent throughout the quarter
Hi, Scott
I'd say in China, what we saw from an end market perspective, it was strong across all end markets with the one exception being the chemical energy
So we saw good growth across all the end markets in China
I also would want to make a comment here about the impact of lunar New Year
You may recall in our guide discussion in last call, we talked about the fact that lunar New Year fell for us here in our fiscal Q1. Well it turned out it did have an impact on reported revenue but not as much as we had predicted
It did have impact on our recurring revenue business such as DGG and service & consumables
But on the instruments side, it was fairly limited as our order fulfillment team did a great job of converting those orders into revenue much earlier in the quarter
But I'd say we really were pleased overall by the performance in China
It looks like we're off to a good start there and good solid growth across almost all the end markets
And if you wouldn't mind, could you repeat the second question for me?
So I'd say there's really no momentum in academia & government right now
We're still seeing fairly subdued levels and constrained levels of funding
There's almost sort of a wait-and-see kind of attitude we're seeing in some of the agencies here, for example, in the United States
Pharma continues to perform quite strongly
As you know, we talked about as we came into 2017, we expect continued strong demand in pharma, although the growth rates would come down as we ran into some tough compares
So pharma is really a development just as we thought coming into 2017. No surprises there
And then I will say the one surprise that we had in Q1 was the fact that we finally saw some signs of growth in the chemicals side of the chem & energy market in the first quarter
So I'm going to pass on the first question since we stopped our reporting on orders a while back
But what I can tell you is we have good visibility going forward from, I'd say the three- to six-month timeframe, so that's typically how we can see our sales funnels
And then probably two-thirds of our revenue in the coming quarter perhaps can come from the existing backlog
So we have pretty good visibility I'd say in the three- to six-month timeframe in terms of the order funnel
But as you'll hear me talk a little bit later, I'm sure it'll come up in the Q&A, is although we are pleased to see the return of growth in the chemical side of the chem & energy market, I don't think one quarter is a trend yet, so we're still going to be keeping a close eye on that one
Yes
Hey, Derik
How about I repeat the question, Didier? We had a little bit of trouble hearing it and then I'll have you answer it
So I think the question from Derik is it looks like we've brought down the operating margin guide by about 0.10%, and he was wondering if that was really driven by FX or if there's any other considerations?
Derik, I really appreciate the opportunity to talk about that
As I highlighted in my conference call, we're also getting some nice external recognition
But what's most important is what customers are saying about the product
And we've got a lot of excitement in our customer base
Now as you know, we had indicated earlier the sales cycle here is going to be a little bit longer because the customers are going to want to check out the product
So we placed a large number of demo units
The orders are starting to come in, but I'd say it's really – we're still early in the – regarding the ramp in the volume so we're really delighted by how the customers are perceiving the new offering
The surprise for us, I have to say, has been what we've been calling the halo effect which is we're also seeing a lot of interest in our other GC platforms, in particular, the 7890 where we're out talking with customers about our new Intuvo GC and they're showing some interest in our other applications to the 7890. So it's, if you will, a halo effect
I think both speak positively about the future for our prospects in gas chromatography
I would also say that in addition to the chemical customers, those customers, particularly contract testing labs in an environmental testing lab, really like the value proposition of the Intuvo tied to the mass spec for the productivity gains
So as a reminder, I think about 6% of the applications base can be covered by this platform, and it goes beyond the chemical side of this
I was just down in Australia talking with one of our contract testing labs, and they really like the productivity benefits that they see with the product
So still too early to call a material impact on our revenue, but the early interest by customers is really quite, quite good
Hey, Brandon
So I have to say it's been a while
From my calendar map, it looks like seven quarters
So it was great to finally see a return to growth in management side in the chemical & energy side
And again, just one quarter so we try not to get too far ahead ourselves, but it was an encouraging side after almost two years of declines of instrument sales in this segment
I think we're really looking at the back half of this year for we're almost starting to be talking more about into though a ramping in terms of the revenue
Again, we had indicated this last year so this is going to be a slower ramp but then typically a direct replacement product because of the need to try it out
It's so different but our view is it'll start – we'll be talking more about our revenue impact probably in the second half of this year
Thanks for that question
I want to make a few opening comments and I'll pass it over to Jacob for some additional detail
But as those on the call probably recall that this was an equity investment we made in a company in Houston, Texas and the idea here is to be able to complete our development of an integrated workflow for the clinical diagnostics market and part of revision is a call option which we have in front of us, and I think Jacob perhaps you can remind everybody the timing and how you think we're coming so far
Everyone wants to spend money before we have to
You're welcome
Hi, Isaac
Isaac, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify remarks
So I think the reason we've been able to have this ability to continue to, from our perspective, outgrow the average of our peers is the strength of our new offerings
So it's very clear by our growth rates and as we look at some of the – all the data, particularly on the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group side, we can see where we're picking up a couple of market share
That's why I highlighted in my remarks the value contribution, if you will, on the new offerings
So we think we're picking up shares
I think that when we look at our guide, we're above what our peers are talking about relative to core revenue growth
I would tell you, if you're thinking about upside for the company, I think it really hinges on chemical energy
And let me share with you our thinking as we've put together the guide, particularly for the second quarter
Perhaps I already tipped my hand here, but we said okay, we were encouraged by the fact that the chemical side of the market of that segment is growing, which as a reminder, is about 50% of the total
We're encouraged by the signs but said listen, one quarter is not a trend
So right now, what we're going to do, we're assuming flattish overall growth in our Q2 guide
What that means is if there's some growth there, that would represent some upside to our current guide
So I think that's one macro factor that could help us on the top line if in fact this return to growth is sustained
But I would want to reemphasize the fact that we think these new offerings are really making a difference in the marketplace and allowing us to pick up some sustained momentum
Let me make a few comments here
And then, Jacob, if I miss anything, feel free to chime in here
But we had focused on the integration of the former Dako business on Agilent mainly as a cost integration savings and simplification of the platform
And as you know, when I came into this role, I felt we really needed to integrate the business, and we've been on a pretty aggressive path since then
But the real benefit is exactly what you described, which is the ability for us to have an integrated reach to the customers where we can have one commercial interaction with the customer
And now we're able to integrate our sales forces and have a combined sale portfolio
So without going into a lot of the details inside the company, we really weren't able to leverage the full power of our sales force, which is where we combine our genomics and diagnostics sales force until now when we have them on the same systems for revenue recognition and commission paying
So, Jacob, anything else you might want to add to that?
I'm going to make a little bit of comment, and then, Jacob, I'll allow you to provide the more lengthy response this time
So the overall theme here is we're continuing to try to build out our genomics portfolio, particularly as it focuses into clinical research and ultimately into the routine diagnostics segment
And why don't you just describe for the audience why we bought the company and what we're hoping to be doing
Didier, do you want to take that one?
And, Didier, maybe I can just maybe finish the story
I have a few comments on LSAG as well
So on the instruments side, we obviously will benefit from the growth
But also as we've mentioned in prior calls, we have a series of initiatives underway and our order fulfillment team really focusing on improving the gross margin
I think they're starting to see somewhat of an impact of those efforts on the instrumentation side of our business
Yeah, we've been pretty consistent in our view
We think it's going to be mid- to high-single digits
So we would expect our ability to sustain growth rates coming in this area throughout the year
So the first quarter, you're right and I appreciate the recognition
We had really stellar growth Q1 of last year so we were pleased that's how the numbers are coming in
And I'd say, Didier will probably expect some kind of similar patterns through the year
Yeah
Yes, we remain fairly conservative on our outlook on Europe in general
I think we're basically assuming flat; not a lot of growth at all in Europe
And I think the – it varies a bit by end market
I think the most subdued are those that are the recipients of government funding
So the government funding side of the European market is really, really, quite soft as well as the chemical and energy market
And I haven't really talked about this yet in the call, but the U.S
and European refineries are really under a lot of margin pressure and they're getting new competition coming in from the U.S
shale gas producers who now can produce alternatives with ethane to the naphtha products that come off of crude refineries
So I think the chem & energy guys are still quite cautious
I think the bright spots are probably the pharma and food testing side
Those areas of investment ties directly to the human health investments that those parts of the world want to make
But overall, we're fairly subdued on Europe as of now
Thanks for the question
I really appreciate the opportunity to talk a bit more about this
So this again for the audience, when we talk about our chemical energy business, we talk about it in three primary segments: 15% in exploration related; 35% in refining related, so about half in what I would say energy; and then about 50% on the chemical side
So that 50% on the chemical side grew in the first quarter, energy did not
And I think it's pretty well-publicized that the exploration side still remains fairly subdued
Again, there's interest coming from customers in the exploration side but we haven't seen it yet turn into revenue
I think the real interesting thing is what's going on with the refinery side because it's sort of a mixed story here because the U.S
and European refiners, their profits continue to be quite slim and I think in 2016 they're about the half of the level of 2015. And what's going on here really are a flat demand, and as I mentioned earlier, increased competition for natural gas alternatives
These guys continue to relentlessly manage CapEx and OpEx expending
So hopefully, that will translate into an interest in our new offerings which gives them a cost advantage so that's why we talk a lot about the Intuvo GC and what it might do in this segment
The Asia refining site is a little bit different which is they're actually adding capacity so there's a number of projects that are still set to come online in 2017 and 2018 which could lead to some new demand
I wouldn't use the word conservative
I would use the word perhaps prudent so what we're saying is one quarter is not yet a trend but I would be very forthright to say this would represent upside to our guide if this growth rate continues in this segment
Hopefully that's helpful insight
Yes, that's a great question and you have the numbers right
So when we look at the install base instrumentation, it's well in excess of 150,000 so a huge addressable market for us so that's why we've had a lot of excited about the offering
I think this is a multiyear upgrade cycle, and I think I'd put three to five years, four to five years is probably a good number given our experience in the LC side, so
Not really, Tycho
The numbers can bounce around a bit depending on quarter to quarter, but we really didn't see anything significantly different in terms of our competitive position
I think it's just been a bit a matter of timing of business closing
So Didier, I don't know if we really saw anything unusual?
You're quite welcome
No
No, not really
The seasonality of our business in Q1 was very consistent with historical patterns so nothing really unusual
Now typically we see a lot of activity from shipment and order bookings in December for the calendar year end money and patterns are what we've seen in prior years
You're welcome
Thanks for the opportunity to provide some more insight here
So I think there's a macro statement above all three of those market segments, which are specific government policies that are driving sustained growth in China
So the CFDA is focusing on really changing the fundamentals of the Chinese pharma industry, and the Chinese pharma companies are investing aggressively to adhere to the new rules
Lots going on in terms of the environmental cleanup efforts consistent with the China five-year plan
There's been a lot more publicized work around lead in water, for example
So I'd say the focus in China environmentally, both in terms of water, soil, and air analysis is really going well
I think I may have mentioned this in the prior call, but the real step up has been in the area of soil analysis for remediation of construction areas
And then finally, the growth in food safety continues
So I really think the government policies across those three segments are really driving very strong growth for us in China
I think you should just think about this as the nature of the beast
This space, and particularly in the United States, tends to be very lumpy with lots of big deals
So it just so happened we had some big deals last year, we didn't have them this year
So we're not seeing anything fundamentally different in terms of the funding levels in the United States beyond there does seem to be some level of wait-and-see to figure out – people are trying to figure out where all the new government policies might land here in 2017. But I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter number
Our view was just a by-product of the timing of deal activity
You're quite welcome
Okay, Tim
We've been waiting for that one
I'm going to pass it over to Didier
He's done some high-level analysis on how we think about it
Yeah
Hi, Bryan
You have a great recollection of the progression of the agencies in China because, as you know, a couple years ago we were pointing to a slowdown in this area because of the reorganization
So I'd say we're probably still in the early innings of this
If you follow the typical five-year plan, this is an area of focus, so I think we're probably still in the early innings of the growth in the food area
I think it's primarily food safety, but I will tell you what is growing very quickly is the food authenticity
We're looking for various forms of counterfeiting of products that may be trying to find their way into the market
So it's still being driven by food safety, but the authenticity side of things is really growing quite strongly
Both from a government customs perspective, but also our private sector clients also want to ensure some testing is done
Excuse me Jonathan, I had a little bit difficulty hearing the question
It's an important part of Jacob's Genomics business but we don't provide a level of detail outside the company, sorry
But it's a nice business for us
Yes
I think you're referring to Gen9 investment
And Gen 9has been purchased by Ginkgo and Agilent was a shareholder in Gen9. Overall, we think there's aspects of the synthetic biology markets that are going to be quite strong in terms of growth
A lot of tools just out there with some of our customers in the Bay Area, for example, as well as Ginkgo
So they're using our tools
Not clear to me though whether companies will be able to build a sustainable business around R&D services in SimBio, and that's why we went in a different direction in terms of our view of Gen9. And Jacob, anything else you'll add to that?
That's right, thanks for that
All right
Thanks a lot, Jon
