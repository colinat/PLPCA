4,dollar
5,Fourth quarter clear aligner revenue of $251.5 million which now includes both Invisalign and Smile Direct Club aligner revenue was up 3.2% sequentially reflecting growth of Invisalign volume partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs
6,Our Q4 shipment volume and revenue to Smile Direct Club were immaterial to the quarter
7,Our year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 17.5% reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customers' channels and geographies
8,"Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $50 to -- from Q3 to about $1,230 reflecting higher promotional activity and the impact of foreign exchange rate"
9,"On a year-over-year basis Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down approximately $20, primarily due to promotional activity and again, the impact of foreign exchange rates which was partially offset by price increases"
10,"For the fourth quarter total Invisalign shipment of about 190,000 cases were up 6.9% sequentially refracting growth primarily from our EMEA and North American customers"
11,Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was 18.5% driven by growth across all regions
12,"For North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 3.2% sequentially and up 20.2% year-over-year"
13,"For North American GPs, case volume was up 9.1% sequentially and up 9.5% year-over-year"
14,"For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 9.1% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year reflecting continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased utilization"
15,"Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q4 was a record 5.2 cases per doctor, up from 4.9 in Q4 last year"
16,"North America ortho utilization was a record 11.3, up from 9.9 in the prior year"
17,"North America GP utilization was 3.2, slightly up from 3.1 in the prior year"
18,"And international utilization was 5.0, flat from Q4 last year as we continue to expand our customer base"
19,"In Q4 we added 3,700 new Invisalign doctors worldwide of which 1,420 were new North American doctors and 2,280 of which were new international doctors"
20,"This compared to 2,615 in Q3 and 2,670 total doctors trained in the same quarter last year"
21,Note that the total number of doctors trained in Q4 includes 670 Invisalign
22,Go doctors in EMEA that were recruited over the course of the year
23,"Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $41.7 million, up 19.3% sequentially and up 156.8% year-over-year"
24,"Moving on to gross margin; fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.1%, flat sequentially and up 0.1 point year-over-year"
25,"Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.5%, down 0.2 point sequentially, primarily due to lower Invisalign ASPs partially offset by cost leverage from higher volume"
26,Clear aligner gross margins were down 0.4 point year-over-year primarily due to increased aligner's per case as we continue to treat more complex cases
27,"Q4 gross margins for our scanner segment was a record 61%, up 3.9 point sequentially and 23.2 point year-over-year, both the sequential and year-over-year increases were primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower manufacturing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to our previous scanner"
28,"Q4 operating expenses were $151.9 million, up sequentially by $4.8 million or 3.2%, primarily related to increased employee headcount which was partially offset by lower media cost and foreign exchange rate impact"
29,"On a year-over-year basis Q4 operating expenses were up 33.8% reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activity, each critical to the growth of business"
30,"Our fourth quarter operating margin was 23.3%, up one point sequentially and down two and half point year-over-year"
31,This sequential increase in operating margin related primarily to OpEx leverage from higher volumes and revenue
32,On a year-over-year basis decreased operating margin primarily reflects higher OpEx as we've grown into business
33,"On a sequential and year-over-year basis, Q4 operating margin was minimally impacted by foreign exchange rates as we have a natural hedge between our revenue and operating expenses"
34,"With regard to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 19.8%, up by approximately 1.4 point compared to Q3 of '16."
35,Recall that Q3 was benefited by a change in our corporate structure as part of our ERP implementation
36,Commencing in the fourth quarter we also began to find aligners to Smile Direct Club
37,Revenue and cost for this activity are included in our operating profit and reported results although they were immaterial to the company

40,Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share
41,was $0.59 compared to $0.63 reported in Q3 and $0.60 reported in the same quarter last year
42,Fourth quarter EPS was unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S
43,"dollar which amounted to approximately $0.08 per share, primarily due to the net realized foreign exchange losses related to the revaluation of certain balance sheet accounts addressing unrealized foreign exchange losses included in other income and expense"
44,In conjunction with the implementation of our new international corporate structure in July we changed the function of currency of our Netherlands entity from euro to U.S
45,"As a result, monetary balance sheet accounts are revalued into U.S"
46,dollars and any impact from that is charged to the P&L
47,Prior to this change these impacts were charged to the balance sheet
48,We have now changed our processes to limit our exposure and the impact of these kinds of currency movement which we believe should not have nearly as large of an impact on earnings going forward
49,"Moving on to the balance sheet, as of the fourth quarter cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investment were a record $700 million"
50,"This compared to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $21.3 million"

52,and $459 million was held by our international entities
53,Q4 accounts receivable balance
54,"was $247.4 million, up approximately 1% sequentially"
55,Our overall DSA --
56,"DSO was 76 days, down two days sequentially and up 14 days year-over-year"
57,The year-over-year increase is a result of our new ERP system implemented in July 2016 and other related systems that impact the timing of our customer collective

61,"Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $14.2 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases or additional manufacturing capacity as well as building improvement"
62,During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $38 million under that April 2014 repurchase plan
63,"Subsequent to year end we completed this plan, we purchasing the remaining $3.8 million"
64,We still have $300 million available for repurchased under the 2016 repurchase plan which we announced last April
65,"Before we move to Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2016 results"
66,"In 2016 we shipped a record 708,000 Invisalign cases of 21.5%"
67,This reflects 32.4% volume growth from our international doctors and 16.4% volume growth from our North American doctor's
68,"Shipments of iTero scanner were up more than three times over 2015 to nearly 4,000 units"
69,"Total revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 27.7% year-over-year"

71,For the year we repurchased 1.1 million shares of Align stock for $96.2 million
72,In 2016 diluted EPS was $2.33.
73,With that let's turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view
74,Starting with demand outlook; for our international market expect seasonally slower period for APAC with the Lunar New Year and for EMEA with winter holiday and vacation
75,"For North America, seasonally up GP and Ortho"
76,"For our scanner business, Q1 capital equipment purchases are seasonally lower"
77,"With this as a backdrop we expect the first quarter to shape up as follow; Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 200,000 to 203,000 cases, up approximately 22.2% to 24% over the same period a year ago reflecting continued strong demand across all channels and region"
78,"We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $295 million to $298 million, an increase of 23.6% to 24.8% year-over-year with gross margins in the range of 74.2% to 74.5%"
79,"We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $162.5 million to $164.5 million, up quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the increased headcount and increased marketing expenses"
80,Q1 operating margin should be in the range of 19.1% to 19.3%
81,Regarding our tax rate; at the start of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update entitled improvements to employee share based payment accounting under this new standard excess tax benefit and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as paid in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement for the reporting period in which they occur
82,Under this new standard we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 1% to 2% which includes $12 million in extra tax benefit
83,"We estimate the Q1 impact of the Smile Direct Club transaction will reduce earnings per share by $0.01 per diluted share, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.3 million exclusive of any share repurchases"
84,"Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 which includes approximately $0.14 of excess tax benefit"
85,"Finally, it should be noted that our Q1 CapEx will be larger than normal as we recently entered into a purchase agreement for the new -- for our new facility in San Jose, California"
86,Accordingly Q1 CapEx should be approximately $70 million to $75 million
87,Now let me turn our view to the full year
88,We anticipate 2017 revenue growth to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model range of 15% to 25%
89,We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at or above midpoint of that model
90,"As for our scanner business, recall that 2016 revenue and volume growth significantly benefited from the unfilled backlog carried over from 2015."
91,"And while we expect the scanner business to do well and continue to grow, we would not expect the same rate of growth of volume and revenue as we saw in 2016."
92,We expect operating margins to be flat to slightly up over our 2016.
93,"Those investments will include geographic expansion both in countries and markets we already serve, as well as expansion into new territories including Latin America and India"
94,"And aggressive direct to consumer advertising campaign targeted directly at teen, international expansion of the Invisalign value chain including order acquisition and treatment planning to get closer to our customers as Joe mentioned"
95,"Commercialization of several new products including in class two and tubular [ph] advancement feature for international markets, Invisalign Go for North America and new iTero scanner features and functionality, and implementation of the CFM model in North America and APAC which was previously rolled out in EMEA"
96,We believe these investments are key to the continued customer adoption and acceleration of our growth
97,"Similar to last year, many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful return"
98,We expect the equity loss from our investment in Smile Direct Club would be two to three times the 2016 losses we recorded
99,We expect our tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 18% which includes $19 million of excess tax benefit
100,"Finally, as typical, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than in the first half with second half operating profit to account for somewhere in the range of 56% to 58% of our full year results"
101,With that I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments
102,"Well, I mean out of everything our production right now is slowly and whereas in Mexico, and 60% of our production goes to North America and 40% goes overseas"
103,"Now you're asking me to comment on Trump's comments, I don't know which tweet"
104,you want me to address
105,I'd say all those tweets have different financial scenarios
106,"Part of it also is going to be reduction of the corporate tax rate, it looks like it's come together maybe"
107,the 20% range or so; so it's really hard --
108,it's kind of washed
109,that's been out right now
110,"What I want to give investors' confidence that we're aware of it, and we'll make the new kind of changes from a flexibility standpoint, we could be nimble on what new to be done"
111,"But the last thing I'd say is, you know our Mexican facility"
112,", I don't want it to be looked as the low cost facility, this is an incredibly high tax credit -- incredibly important aspect to us"
113,and so we've invested tons of money over 20 years to bring this as a modern day production facility
114,", it's the biggest 3D printing business in the world"
115,This is really a valuable asset for us and we'll do all we can just to make that asset as productive as possible regardless of what we see
116,"Steve, this is John"
117,I think what we saw -- we saw a very good volume in Q4
118,and I think that's what led to strong shipments and strong revenue performance in Q4
119,and we've seen that continue into January and into 2017 that we feel very good about where we're at from a volume standpoint
120,and that's why we've given the Q1 guidance
121,and it helped strengthen where we think we're going to be at for 2017.
122,Unidentified Analyst
123,"As you look back at order patterns over the last several months, do you think it might have been in part more of a timing issue where new orders were delayed upto the latter stages of the year and into January?"
124,"Yes, sure John"
125,"It's very minimal, we're definitely ramping up and growing with the Smile Direct Club but in our numbers it's very, very minimal"
126,"On your DSO question, I'd say don't misinterpret my answer on the DSO"
127,"You know, the DSOs, they have some pretty good targets in a sense that they could grow; they will get a commensurate kind of discount from Invisalign standpoint"
128,"What I'm saying is in the whole mix of products that we have in North America, don't overweight that thing falling down the overall total"
129,"But you will see the DSOs can grow aggressively, they will be rewarded for it"
130,and so we'll continue to grow that
131,"From an ASP standpoint, I think you have to remember we've got price last year too and that helps us"
132,FX didn't help us in the fourth quarter and that way also
133,"so we're playing in a bandwidth here, you know, price increases, FX of $20 or so"
134,and I have no ideaâ€
135,¦
136,"Yes, international mix"
137,So I think David continue to guide ASPs that we're pretty much constant from year to year
138,We still think about that
139,but there is a lot of noises when we think about that from oceans that we do and mix like Shirley mentioned
140,But we're counting on it pretty level as we go into 2017.
