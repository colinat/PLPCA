0,"Thanks Steve, and good morning"
1,everyone
2,We're excited to start fiscal 2017 in a positive way
3,Our results and business fundamentals were better than we expected
4,Several of our businesses made key contributions to our results this quarter and I will cover these highlights in my prepared remarks
5,"I have two main topics this morning, I will recap our Q1 adjusted results and our revised fiscal '17 outlook"
6,Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter of fiscal '17 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted
7,With let's move to our results
8,"Revenues were $38.2 billion up 4%, our pharmaceutical distribution segment accounted for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix and the strength of our ABSG specialty business"
9,Let me highlight that we had one less business day in the current quarter versus the previous year
10,"We also had less of a revenue tailwind this quarter given the slowdown in branded drug inflation from July through December, while still having a meaningful revenue headwind from brand and generic drug conversions"
11,Our ABC consolidated revenue growth would have been nearly 6% on a comparable basis which means adjusting for the one-day difference in business days
12,The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased by 1% to $1.1 billion and was entirely due to the growth in our other segment
13,Our pharmaceutical distribution segment was down this quarter with a difficult comparison as we're still cycling through the repricing of two strategic long-term contract renewals which we have discussed in detail the past few quarters and in the current quarter we began to anniversary the acquisition of PharMEDium
14,Operating expenses we are very pleased with our progress in managing operating expenses which were virtually flat compared to last year
15,"Our businesses continue to make meaningful progress focusing on their cost structures, ensuring they spend in the right areas and leveraging existing scale and capabilities where we can"
16,"Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $486 million up about $9 million or 2%"
17,Our adjusted operating margin was 1.27% down three basis points from the prior year driven mostly by the pharmaceutical distribution segment bringing down six basis points this quarter
18,Moving below the operating income line
19,Interest expense net was about $35 million up some from last year
20,The increase is due to a combination of slightly higher average borrowings outstanding and also higher interest associated with the build to suit leases we had to capitalize last quarter
21,"Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 33.1% down some from the prior year as a result of changes in mix of U.S"
22,versus international income
23,For the quarter our adjusted diluted EPS increased a solid 7% to $1.36 to 7% growth was driven by the outstanding performance in our other segment
24,The benefit from an improving tax rate and a lower diluted share count
25,I will highlight that we did have a couple of pennies of EPS benefit in the current quarter from the favorable timing on manufacturer rebates that we previously expected to earn in our March '17 quarter
26,This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results
27,Let's move forward and discuss our segment results starting with pharmaceutical distribution
28,Total segment revenues were $36.6 billion up 4% with our drug company growing just under this level
29,"Our core drug business saw a solid growth better than we expected in its retail, customer segment which includes Independent, Walgreens and other chains"
30,Consistent with the past few quarters I should point out that the business continue to have a revenue headwind of about 1.5% due to lower hepatitis C drug sales primarily in our non-retail customer segment
31,"After this current December quarter, the hepatitis C comparables get better and shouldn't be a meaningful revenue headwind going forward"
32,ABSG which is our specialty business and an overall revenue increase of 10% driven primarily by volume growth
33,This is the 12th consecutive quarter that ABSG has had top line growth at 10% or more
34,We continue to see excellent revenue growth in oncology and to a lesser degree in nephrology
35,Overall the business continues to capitalize on positive pharmaceutical industry trends and we remain a clear leader in this space
36,Segment operating income was $374 million and was down 2%
37,Our ABSG business continued their high level of performance producing strong operating income growth through a disciplined expense management combined with a revenue growth
38,"Our drug company was down year-over-year as anticipated primarily due to the two key customer contract renewals, slightly lower contributions from price appreciation and the impact from generic deflation"
39,Last year ended December '16 quarter generic deflation wasn't that meaningful
40,These headwinds were partially offset by a higher contribution from PharMEDium
41,I'd like to point out that our drug company's performance was better than we expected and the business is building positive momentum from both top line revenue growth and an improving contribution from generics
42,"We are committed to continuous improvement, the drug company has sharpened it's focus on maintaining high customer service levels and implementing leading customer solutions"
43,As a result we are seeing generic compliance rates gradually improve with customers which translates the higher volumes
44,"We can now move to our other segment which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI Animal Health"
45,In the December quarter segment revenues were nearly $1.7 billion up just over 5% both consulting and World Courier at growth rate in the high single-digits while MWI's growth was slightly impacted by foreign exchange associated with their U.K
46,MWI continues to see high growth rate in the U.S
47,"companion animal business, that's a percentage in the high single-digits"
48,and we are now encouraged as we're starting to see improving growth rate in the production animal side of the business
49,From an operating income standpoint this segment had an outstanding quarter with operating income of $112 million and the growth rate of 17%
50,This marks the first time that the segment has surpassed $100 million in operating income
51,As Steve highlighted MWI achieved records in operating income and operating margin
52,"The business has a relentless focus on the customer, a drive to constantly improved capability and terrific expense management"
53,Wrapping up our consulting business was also a strong contributor to the segments growth this quarter due to a solid revenue growth
54,They delivered these results while continuing to focus on implementing a business process redesign which includes a new ERP system
55,This completes our segment review
56,I'd like to now cover key working capital and cash flow items
57,In the December quarter as expected we had a negative free cash flow of $570 million
58,"As we have discussed in the past, we continue to make a working capital investment with our largest customer Walgreens"
59,This investment will continue to be a cash flow headwind into our Q2 '17 when the investment is complete
60,"When comparing to last year's free cash flow, we also had a sizable positive day of the week cash impact to our Q1 '16 free cash flow"
61,This day of the week impact did not repeat in the current quarter and was a headwind
62,We ended the quarter with roughly $1.8 billion in cash with $645 million of this amount offshore
63,The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks
64,We purchased $230 million of shares during the quarter and we finished the quarter with $890 million left on our November 2016 share authorization
65,We're pleased that from late September 2016 through December 2016 we are able to buy back roughly 8 million shares returning over $600 million to our shareholders
66,Now let's turn to our updated fiscal '17 expectations
67,As I mentioned before we are very pleased with our strong Q1 results and we are now raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.72 to $5.92 which reflect growth of 2% to 5% versus last fiscal year
68,I will provide guidance comments in four key areas
69,"First, revenues, our previous guidance was 6.5% to 8% revenue growth even with our Q1 '17 ABC consolidated revenue growth of 4%"
70,We believe we will now be at the high end of this range due to two factors that will enable us to ramp our revenues during the course of the fiscal year
71,"One, our drug company's largest customer Walgreens had added new commercial business which will benefit us and two, brand inflation realized in January will be a better revenue tailwind going forward"
72,"The secondary operating expenses given the continued focus by our businesses on managing costs, we are revising our full-year OpEx growth rate to 4.5% to 6%"
73,We expect that our expenses will increase over the course of the fiscal year to support the revenue ramp
74,Additionally we start to occur incremental costs related to several of our IT and infrastructure investments
75,"The third area, operating income, we are revising and moving to low end of our guidance up"
76,Our operating income dollar growth will now be flat to up 4% versus fiscal '16.
77,And the last area our adjusted share account
78,We'd expect our share account to creep up somewhat given that we front-end loaded our share repurchases
79,We expect modest share repurchase activity in the near-term
80,Our first priority now is to ensure our free cash flow track as planned in a repaid $600 million debt obligation that matures in May 2017.
81,"As in the past however, we will remain flexible and opportunistic in terms of capital deployment"
82,Let me point out that the rest of our previously communicated fiscal '17 financial guidance for ABC consolidated is unchanged and reaffirmed at this time
83,Before I wrap up I'd like to comment on our working assumptions for the pharmaceutical drug pricing environment
84,I will cover generic drug pricing first
85,We are not changing our negative 7% to negative 9% generic deflation range for fiscal '17 at this time
86,After one quarter based on our drug company's generic drug portfolio we are tracking in line with this assumption
87,"As we progress through the year, we'll hopefully have more clarity on generic pricing trends and if needed we will revise our assumption"
88,"Moving to brand drug pricing, we are comfortable with our 7% to 9% brand inflation rate assumption based on the WAC price increases we realized in January"
89,"Both the number of brand pricing announcements, and the overall percentage increases were right in line with what we had assumed"
90,"As a reminder we also anticipate that we will have a certain level of brand price increases in the June, July time period"
91,This is clearly an open item given the unpredictability of pricing actions in the high level of scrutiny
92,This is part of the reason we continue to have a somewhat wider adjusted EPS range
93,"So in closing a better than expected quarter and a solid start to our fiscal year, as always we continue to deliver outstanding service, solutions and value to our customers each and every day"
94,And at the same time we look to drive operating efficiencies
95,This is a winning combination that enables AmerisourceBergen to grow and create long-term shareholder value
96,Now here's Keri to start our Q&A
97,Thanks Bob for the question and I'll take them in order
98,So the first one we did see brand pricing trail off a bit in our first quarter to December quarter
99,So that was a little bit of a headwind for our core drug business that we were able to cover
100,So that's true
101,but then we got the January
102,", we saw the price increases relatively in-line with last year in terms of the number of announcements"
103,The percentages were probably a little bit less overall on a kind of weighted average basis but clearly the January price increases were in line with our 7% to 9% assumptions
104,So no change there
105,We're keeping that assumption for the full-year
106,"I think our point in my script was really to say that there is another time period coming June, July"
107,Our guidance still has a certain level of pricing activity in our assumptions and that's an open item
108,but I think with our $0.20 range
109,", I think Steve and I and the management team"
110,"we're comfortable that if that trailed off a bit in June or July, we would still fall within the range"
111,okay
112,but again that's just one item
113,but I would say we feel good that if the brand inflation - again I'll repeat myself as it trails off a bit we can still stay in the range but on probably the lower end
114,"Yes, and I think Steve you hit it"
115,", I mean certainly we benefited â€"
116,"“ December is always one of the better quarters from MWI as they come down to year end contracts with manufacturers but going forward the consulting business I commented in my script that they will be implementing the new ERP system and theyâ€™ll be having some expenses in that area will ramp up a bit in quarters two, three and four"
117,"But itâ€™s a great margin, itâ€™s the margin have been fairly high"
118,But I would say that - this probably isnâ€™t the run rate but probably not that far off
119,I mean it should be a good margin business and
120,all those businesses leverage well
121,"Let me go back, I mean I think the brand -"
122,your brand question is a good one
123,and I think I should clarify
124,"I think I said when I answered Bob's question first, I said it trailed of a bit"
125,we would stay in our range and again I think that's important to me
126,I'm not going to comment if we had zero price increases for the rest of the year
127,and we didnâ€
128,™t see any pricing activities
129,I mean weâ€™d had to go back and think about that and understand the impact
130,but certainly it trails off a bit
131,we feel comfortable staying in our range on the brand side
132,"Generic deflation, I mean we've been very consistent on the minus 7% to minus 9%"
133,We've always pegged that off of our acquisition cost of the acquisition cost in our inventory to let people know that that's what weâ€™re seeing in terms of how that price - so how our acquisition cost is changing over period time
134,We're probably up towards the higher end of that range
135,and so I think I answered your question
136,"but again that's how we calculate itâ€™s on our portfolio, our mix of business based on our fiscal year"
137,but we still feel good about that minus 7% to minus 9% and as we go through the year we'll update the range
138,Thanks Bob Iâ€™ll start
139,Certainly we reaffirmed our guidance and
140,so I mean the guidance for free cash flow was at adjusted net income
141,"we're just slightly above,"
142,so weâ€™re still on that
143,"I know we had a negative free cash flow in Q1, but the cadence seasonality in our business we should see a nice positive free cash flow in our March quarter somewhat neutral to up a little bit the June quarter"
144,and then traditionally our fourth quarter is pretty high in terms of free cash flow
145,So that's how we get back to where we need to be for the year
146,And CapEx I think we said $500 million roughly - thatâ€™s
147,reaffirmed
148,and we should be right about that in that range and most of that
149,is the DC work and the ERP system
150,So both were consistent and both we still feel good about
151,Iâ€™ll start Garen on the first one back to the generic deflation
152,We have not changed our methodology or approach
153,"We've been very, very consistent"
154,"It's always based on our drug company's portfolio of what they have in inventory, weighted average"
155,It's based on our fiscal year
156,We do exclude generic items that have not been on the market for longer than one year
157,So we take the ones that too have higher variability in that first year
158,So we've been very consistent and we track it
159,We look at the methodology and were still coming up in that range of minus 7 to minus 9 and again I said little on the high end right now at the minus 9.
160,That's why we still feel comfortable at this point
161,"Tax reform, I'm looking atâ€¦"
162,"Yes, thanks Lisa"
163,"Let me clarify no, thereâ€™re couple pennies we called out a little bit of timing and that would be in pharmaceutical distribution so more on the drug company side"
164,"Right, yes the couple pennies to clarify -"
165,the couple pennies
166,really we thought we would come as we earned in the March quarter they have pulled forward
167,We hit some triggers early but Steve point is right in terms of the MWI that our calendar year there are contracts of manufacturers around our calendar year and you always come down to proving that up based on final volumes and you have two different tiers and that helped us in the December quarter with MWI
168,but that happens every December nothing unusual
169,"I think the manufacturers realize we provide extremely valuable service in terms of the quantities we keep an inventory, the credit, the collections that we provide so"
170,"I mean I think they realize it, itâ€™s a very good value and very economical"
171,"And we had discussions, we had fee-for-service agreements over 10 plus years and we see those continuing and we donâ€"
172,™t see those changing going forward though it seems to be very acceptable based on WAC pricing and that's how the industry is compensated
