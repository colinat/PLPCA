12,"Again, thank you to the AmerisourceBergen team for all that you do"
13,"Next, let me take a minute to talk about the U.S"
14,"pharmaceutical industry, where AmerisourceBergen has strategically focused its business"
15,"While there are challenges, the U.S"
16,pharmaceutical market remains well-positioned for the long term
17,"Key drivers for growth include an aging patient population, an improving U.S"
18,"economy, a robust pipeline of new anticipated brand drug launches, and an increasing focus on the relationship between value and outcomes"
19,"We see both resilience and continuing growth opportunities in pharmaceuticals and, importantly, we see a vital role for manufacturer and provider services to support the market expansion over time"
20,"So, against the backdrop of these market conditions and long-term opportunities, how do we view AmerisourceBergen's role within the broader healthcare landscape"
21,"We define that role with our company's new purpose statement, which I think is particularly important in today's environment"
22,"At AmerisourceBergen, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures"
23,Everything we do as a company ties back to this purpose
24,"When we provide services and solutions that improve product access, increase efficiency across the healthcare system, and enhance patient care, all that is done to fulfill our purpose"
25,"The value we bring to manufacturers, providers and, most importantly, to patients helps fulfill that responsibility to create healthier futures"
26,"Let's talk about how are we delivering on this responsibility and supporting the growth of our customers, while also creating value for our shareholders"
27,We believe there are four key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart and have positioned us for growth
28,"First, we believe we have the best customer base in the business"
29,Our broad and diversified portfolio of growing customers across all our businesses performed well in the second quarter
30,We enjoy long-standing collaborative relationships with our anchor customers and they continue to be among the best positioned companies in the industry for long-term growth
31,"Walgreens Boots Alliance remains a strong and aligned partner, and we look forward to continuing to expand our relationships to deliver value"
32,We expect to add the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime business in June of this year
33,"Although, the profit contribution will be immaterial this fiscal year and we continue to be optimistic about the future addition of Rite Aid, we are also seeing impressive growth across all other key customers, several large community oncology practices and MWI's largest customers"
34,"Additionally, as recently announced, we entered into a five-year strategic contract with Express Scripts for their brand business through 2022."
35,This is a key win for AmerisourceBergen and an illustration of the strong relationships we're able to build with our customers
36,"For the past five years, we worked hard to be the best possible partner and provide the highest levels of service and value to the Express Scripts team"
37,We are proud that those efforts resulted in a new long-term contract agreement and we are excited to continue to collaborate with Express as a distribution service partner of choice
38,"In the last year, our Drug Corporation has also discussed two important customer initiatives and we are making progress on both"
39,"First, our efforts to improve compliance and expand our share of wallet within our existing customer base are yielding results and helping us to grow our generics volumes"
40,We've sharpened our focus on reducing leakage and on providing our customers with the tools they need to realize the greatest business benefit of buying within their Prime Vendor Agreement
41,"For example, our investments in Good Neighbor Pharmacy member services are helping to optimize front-end sales"
42,"We are providing access to business coaching, manufacturer promotions and new reporting tools that incorporate point of sales data"
43,GNP also entered into a five-year partnership with the National Community Pharmacists Association to produce a series of educational seminars for members
44,Early response to those services has been extremely positive
45,We've had 50% growth in the past 12 months across our GNP premier level membership
46,"Second, we are making progress with our Drug Corporation customers on our effort to rebalance our contracts and specialty pricing strategies to better reflect changing market trends and shifts in product mix"
47,This rebalancing effort is one we've embarked on over a year ago
48,and we have made significant progress
49,Our customers understand the value this restructuring brings in and we continue to establish mutually beneficial adjustments
50,"Throughout AmerisourceBergen, we have the strongest customer base in the industry"

53,The strength of our business is reinforced by the high quality of our customers and our ability to develop these long-term collaborative partnerships
54,"Working together to advance and enhance patient care, it is always our goal to create customers for life"
55,"Our second differentiator is our leadership position in specialty, which puts AmerisourceBergen at the forefront of a rapidly growing market segment"
56,We are very proud of our long-standing leadership in specialty
57,"I should note that when we refer to our leadership here, it includes our market leading position in full-line distribution within our drug company, specialty distribution through our ABSG business and our service offerings to specialty manufacturers ranging from pre to post commercialization support"
58,AmerisourceBergen has a history of strategic investment and leadership in specialty
59,"And in the second quarter, we continued to grow our footprint and capabilities"
60,"We are pleased to see continued growth of specialty products available through full-line distribution, affirming the value and efficiency of the Prime Vendor model with many products for customers across multiple sites of care including hospital, health system and community pharmacies"
61,"For example, we are seeing strong growth in hospital and health systems use of biosimilar that recently became available in full-line distribution"
62,"In the second quarter, our ABSG specialty distribution businesses delivered very strong results with revenue growing double-digits year-over-year"
63,This is the 13th consecutive quarter with that level of growth for this business
64,"Our strong operating income growth was driven by overall volume increases, new drug introductions, expanded indications for existing products and good expense leverage"
65,"Our market-leading patient support services, biopharma consulting businesses, and clinical trial logistics businesses provided by Lash Group, Xcenda and World Courier also continue to make important contributions in supporting existing and newly launched specialty products"
66,"With our market-leading franchises, AmerisourceBergen is a clear leader in the commercialization, market access and patient support of specialty drugs"
67,We are proud of our trusted partner status and close collaboration with manufacturers and providers to ensure patient access to all types of specialty products
68,"Third, AmerisourceBergen's innovative approach to services and solutions is helping to drive our customers' growth"
69,We at AmerisourceBergen know that we are a healthcare services company
70,Our value lies in offering our manufacturer and provider customers the most innovative and business critical services and solutions they need to advance their business and drive their growth
71,"Customer adoption of our innovative offerings has been strong, and we believe that is enabling us to grow within our existing customer base now and in the future"
72,"For example, our Consulting Services continues to lead the market and demonstrated very strong growth in the fiscal second quarter"
73,"We now have more than 5,000 employees in Consulting, working with all top 20 pharmaceutical companies and more than 150 manufacturers in total"
74,Manufacturer services are key to our differentiated upstream value proposition and we continue to grow the breadth and scale of our offerings
75,The value we provide through our product commercialization services and our consultant strategic approach was just reaffirmed to our senior management team at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores industry meeting when manufacturers called out to us the unique strength of AmerisourceBergen
76,Another area where we are investing is our design of state-of-the-art distribution centers and our implementation of innovative IT solutions
77,"To improve the customer experience and enhance capacity and operational efficiency, we are strategically building our new state-of-the-art distribution centers for our Drug Corporation business"
78,"In the second quarter, we brought our Olive Branch, Mississippi center fully online, both on time and on budget"
79,Olive Branch employs the most leading-edge technology in our industry and is now the largest distribution center in our network
80,We're excited by the improved capabilities these investments provide and how they position AmerisourceBergen for the future
81,"On the IT front, we are currently building out a new robust technology platform to better support our Lash Group patient services"
82,"We're also continuing the phased rollout of our ABC Order platform; a state-of-the-art customer experience and e-commerce system designed by pharmacists for pharmacists that provide the intuitive tools to order effortlessly, manage inventory, access data and information, and resolve any issues quickly"
83,Both of these business critical system investments remain on budget and on track for full implantation
84,"In addition, in January we rolled out a new order analytics module through our Swiss analytics platform, Certio, with generics manufacturers as the initial target"
85,This module offers manufacturers unprecedented insight into the order fulfillment cycle
86,Order shipment and receiving align for more proactive daily managing of service and inventory levels
87,The module is an industry-first innovation and demonstrates our commitment to providing increased transparency and incremental value to our manufacture partner through analytics
88,"There are several other information system projects and programs underway across our business, all aimed at increasing efficiency and effectiveness while improving our customer engagement"
89,All of these IT initiatives are examples of why AmerisourceBergen is the trusted data company in our industry
90,"We plan to continue to invest in data solutions, analytics and internal and customer-facing IT capabilities to maintain and grow that position"
91,"And finally, our fourth differentiator is our strong history of financial stewardship and proven ability to integrate acquired businesses, which together gives AmerisourceBergen an advantage in driving growth"
92,AmerisourceBergen always takes the strategic approach to capital deployment
93,"We are focusing on investing in the business, strong expense management, building long-term durable growth, and creating significant value for shareholders"
94,We are proud of our ability to integrate our acquisitions smoothly and enhance growth across those businesses
95,"For example, a growth driver in our March quarter was the contribution from our strategic acquisition of MWI Animal Health"
96,"MWI delivered another record revenue quarter led by excellent customer retention, strong growth in the U.S"
97,"companion pet market, and its doubling of the number of corporate accounts in the past year"
98,"Additionally, we are strategically increasing our investment in PharMEDium to support its continued growth"
99,"We are committed to the highest levels of product quality and patient safety and, therefore, are enhancing PharMEDium's QA and QC systems"
100,This supports batch level finished product testing prior to product release
101,"The initiative will enable us to deliver the highest levels of product quality and patient safety, while also creating a compelling competitive advantage"
102,"These efforts do mean that we will ship fewer units and incur incremental costs as we focus on optimizing the QA systems, resulting in slight bottom line headwind for the business in fiscal year 2017, but we are excited about the progress being made here"
103,"Turning to our capital deployment priorities, in the near term, as we've previously communicated, we are planning to pay down our $600 million in debt due this month"
104,"Over the longer term, we continue to approach capital deployment strategically and opportunistically and our priorities are as follows"
105,One: invest in the business
106,"As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in infrastructure and quality assurance processes and to enhance our services and solutions product offerings all to better serve our customers and drive organic growth"
107,Two: strategic M&A
108,We are always evaluating ways we could further add to our value proposition and grow AmerisourceBergen through the addition of best-in-class and market-leading businesses
109,We are interested in enhancing our broad range of core capabilities to better upstream and downstream customers and build on our proven track records on M&A and success
110,Three:
111,share repurchases
112,"We are open to and have board authorization for continued buyback of AmerisourceBergen shares, and we will repurchase when we believe it is the optimal way to build shareholder value"
113,"And finally, four:"
114,dividends
115,We remain committed to providing shareholders with a reasonable dividend
116,"In summary, we believe AmerisourceBergen is clearly differentiated, strategically focused and delivering undeniable value to our customers and the overall healthcare industry"
117,We remain resilient and have continued to execute in the fiscal second quarter despite market challenges
118,"We remain committed to enabling the growth of our customers, serving patients and delivering value to our shareholders, and we are moving forward with a clear and defined purpose, unified and united in our responsibility to create healthier futures"
119,"Now, let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth look at our quarterly financial results and our updated financial guidance"
120,Yeah
121,"I'll start off, Bob"
122,Thanks for the question
123,"Again, our competitors â€"
124,"“ I think, in many ways, of course, we live in the same environment, but we have lots of differences in our businesses, including capital deployment and generic profile"
125,"We're not big, for example, on the spot market, telemarketing, tough ("
126,38:51) businesses
127,"I think there also may be some differences in the way that we measure that index now as well, at least we heard on the call recently"
128,So our forecasting method has remained constant
129,"Tim said we are at the top-end of the range and we most certainly are, and we'll have to see how â€"
130,"“ it's a very fluid market, the generic market, you know as well as I do"
131,"And the key determinants are the higher price, the drugs are â€"
132,“ the higher priced generic drugs are subject to more competition
133,"Currently, that's an area where I think manufacturers are seeing opportunity, and we could see some more pressure, but right now, we're holding onto that high-end of the 7% to 9% range"
134,"Tim, you want to add"
135,It started last year when we go through our planning process
136,"We start that around May every year with it being a September year-end, and recognizing that we weren't going to have the robust industry trends that we had experienced in the past couple of years"
137,"And Tim and I spoke to our business heads, and we really instituted some strict expense policies"
138,And ABC had had a pretty good couple of years
139,and I think there were opportunities
140,We felt there were some opportunities to take some expenses down
141,Our team is fantastic
142,Our culture is very receptive to providing good returns to investors
143,"So I think we were very cautious, and it's worked out probably even better than we expected"
144,The expense control has been impressive
145,"Hopefully â€“ certainly to ourselves and, hopefully, to all of you as well"
146,"Anything to add, Tim?"
147,Yeah
148,It's also the first quarter we hadn't lapped
149,We didn't have any new acquisitions that we hadn't lapped
150,"It's the first quarter where everything had been lapped, so"
151,"It's actually, in a couple of months' time, I saw Mick Besse, and it's almost 20 years since we bought Besse Medical, and Lash Group was also 20 years ago"
152,"And so, we've had a history, and I think a lot of our management team comes from the specialty group"
153,"We've had a history of adding in businesses that expand our services, but are very tied to pharmaceutical care"
154,We absolutely regard businesses like Lash and Xcenda as core businesses
155,We've talked a lot on this call about our investments in Lash
156,It's our biggest people business
157,and we detailed the number programs we're doing
158,So we do regard that as an area of strong capability and strong interest
159,"Again, those markets, those businesses, are not as well developed outside the U.S"
160,In the U.S
161,", we have very high market share and very strong customer relationships and a lot of opportunities to deploy capital to be more efficient"
162,So that's often how we think about it
163,"So areas of focus for us are international specialty, which is an emerging area"
164,We look at a lot of companies
165,We start with â€“ FCPA is critical to us and the type of partners
166,"We've learned a lot from our pro forma experience, so I think that's very illustrative to us"
167,And one thing we believe we've done very well there is choose our partners
168,We've done really well with the specialty JV
169,Innomar in Canada is another good example of success that we've had where we are leading the specialty market there
170,So those are the sort of characteristics of a market we like
171,"MWI is â€“ certainly, one of the reasons they joined ABC, is for international development, and we've done some in the U.K"
172,Jim and his team are very active
173,"I think we'd be disappointed if, in the next few years, we didn't get something done there"
174,"We think there's opportunities and we have technology to deploy particularly on the lot feeding production side, where the customers seem to be very sticky"
175,"and we think, as land becomes more scarce, there will be a trend towards lot feedings"
176,Those are some of the key themes
177,"Tim has one thing he wants to say, no?"
178,"First of all, the business is ahead of what our acquisition model is"
179,I would say we had an exceptional first year there
180,"And I think this year, we're strengthening the team"
181,"We're happy with Jenn Adams, who's leading that business for us and was the Head of Sales"
182,"and she's had a long history of the business, what she's doing"
183,"We called it out because we've had some reduction in the quantities that they are producing and it's because of some very, really, ahead of the market, ahead of legislation procedures that we've decided to adopt around testing"
184,But we're doing all that internally
185,It's certainly nothing â€
186,“ I haven't heard of a connection with Charles River or anything
187,"It's just really making sure we stay ahead of the quality curve, making sure we stay ahead of regulators"
188,"We are several times the size of any other competitors in that space and, of course, the regulators look to us to set the standard"
189,So that's absolutely what we're doing
190,"and we feel good about the quality and the competitive edge that AmerisourceBergen and PharMEDium have, and we think our customers have also been very, very supportive"
191,So we like the business and we continue invest in it
192,"So, I think that covered all your questions"
193,"Yeah, Garen, that's tough, right?"
194,Anytime you look at one key â€
195,"“ it is a key assumption and we track it, but it's hard to look at anything in isolation"
196,"In any business you're going to have puts and takes, you're going to have things go in different ways"
197,But we have a $0.15 range
198,We felt that was important in the second half of the year because of brand pricing and generic pricing
199,So I really â€
200,"“ certainly, that would be a headwind, but we'd have to see how it fits in with other puts and takes"
201,"Yeah, we knew a cash flow question was coming, Bob"
202,"Well, we are very proud"
203,"You'll recall that when this contract was signed first time five years ago, we really came from well behind to become the combined Express Scripts and Medco distributor"
204,That was â€
205,“ we were very proud of that at the time and we're proud to continue
206,I think we were disappointed that we didn't get called wickedly good again on the press release
207,We thought that was a really neat adjective
208,"But I think that we had some other great descriptions, future derisked, or"
209,"So we struggle to keep up with the eloquence of our CEO colleague, my CEO colleague at Express Scripts"
210,"But the agreement is largely as it was before, no big changes on terms"
211,"We were very mindful, of course, of changes in mixes which you'd expect us to do and is a theme with all of our customers from big to small, how the mix would change and what sort of contemplation of newer therapies like biosimilars, maybe cell-based therapies, but this framework gives us an opportunity to partner in really any category, and that's what we're excited about"
212,"and there's also lots of good business reasons for us to work with Express on, say, networks, et cetera"
213,We continue to do that
214,"And we're really proud that they selected us and also for a five-year term, which we think is very significant with a company that is so scaled in our industry"
215,So that's about all I'd say
216,You know what?
217,Thanks for the question
218,We talked a lot about how robust the generic sales were
219,"In fact, we now have over 4,500 GNP and Elevate customers"
220,"And that's, I think, one of the key things that Tim and I judge our management team on is, we're making these investments, what's it doing in the marketplace?"
221,And we are really pleased with how Elevate and GNP Premier are progressing
222,Part of the CPA renewal was to bring all their members onto Premier level membership
223,"Our view is certainly one that may be it could be a little bit biased, but we believe it that GNP Premier members are more successful"
224,We have data to show that
225,They're more integrated with us
226,and we have peer-to-peer information that could show they're the most successful pharmacy
227,And we believe they're the most reliant customers
228,"They're customers we don't have to worry about on compliance, et cetera"
229,So we had a very good quarter with independents and we expect it to continue
230,"But growing within our customer base and increasing that market share, so we've had very nice pickup on compliance and part of that is tools and part of it is emphasis"
231,"In my experience, if you point sales people in the right way and tell them what you want to accomplish, and we've been very clear that we expect to get compliance out of the contracts that we have, that we've signed and we think are very fair to our customers"
232,So probably that's all to say there
233,"Next question, please?"
234,"Hi, Lisa"
235,"Yeah, I think two years ago, one buying group switched, and we've talked about that a lot"
236,"And again, the buying groups, it's tough for them to switch because it is a shared relationship and most of us have had those customers for a long time"
237,So we've been talking about this for a long time
238,It's competitive
239,It's always been competitive
240,I think we face competition amongst our peers
241,We also face competition with reimbursement rates and making sure that our customers can stay in networks
242,"And I always talk about this that we have three key missions at AmerisourceBergen in terms of smaller customers, and that's community veterinarians, community oncologists and retail pharmacies, and our goal"
243,there is to help them be successful as independent businesses and looking at all the forces that they have to contend with
244,"So, think about a standalone business and how do we help them?"
245,So that's why we do GNP and Elevate
246,", that's why we do business coaching, and we do these type of things, clinical programs, we do these type of things across all three businesses"
247,"And one of the things that brings me great interest and satisfaction is when we can look at combined programs that benefit each of those groups, and we're seeing that a lot"
248,"Obviously, there's enormous differences between, say, an oncologist and a veterinarian, but there's a lot of things that they have in common, and we work on that, and we have a lot of shared experience"
249,"But I would also say we've got a lot of good mobile tools now, so those reps that go out on the field, they do have key data points that they can share with customers about how compliance benefits them"
250,"We've worked very hard with our buying group customers, the management of those buying group customers to say we've been transparent, we're giving you the great price, this is how compliance benefits both of us"
251,This is what we expect to get
252,"This is what best in class looks like, and I think that that's been very productive"
253,"And then I go back to those suite of services and solutions, the customers are realizing value, and I think that that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy"
254,"As they realize the value, they become more adherent and we do better through that"
255,So it's always been competitive
256,We haven't picked up any new buying group customers
257,"Some of our buying groups are growing, but nothing exceptional"
258,"We are really pleased with the pickup in compliance rate, but we're not complacent"
259,We think there's more
260,"We want to see that compliance rate be in the 90%s, so that's our long term goal"
261,"So, we'll start servicing Prime next month, so it's really more of a fourth quarter event"
262,A lot of it is specialty
263,"The Alliance JV, Prime Alliance JV is mainly specialty products, and we were expecting it"
264,"And I think the relationship we have with WBA is enormously successful, and we have incredibly close interaction with them, and we expect that business that comes into their orbit becomes ABC business, and that's why we did the 10-year agreement"
265,", we did WBAD, the warrants, et cetera"
266,"All of these were planned out four years ago, and we're proud as to how it's working out in the real world, and it is over four years now into that relationship"
267,"And we've been proud to help WBA grow, and make sure that anybody they bring into their sphere significantly becomes an ABC customer as well"
268,"So that's really been the goal, and that's what we're seeing with Prime"
269,"Tim, do you want to just â€"
270,“ anything on the top line volume that we've come to expect (61:35)?
271,"Thank you, everybody"
272,Thank you for the questions
273,"Our prepared remarks are a bit long, so we appreciate your attention, but we're just very proud of the quarter"
274,"I think we are achieving so many of our goals, say, in generic compliance and the technology deployments, and we also are very proud on the softer side of the recognition we're getting in areas like diversity"
275,"Internally, the purpose, united in our responsibility to create healthier futures has been very well received, very uplifting, and again, AmerisourceBergen proves to be a great place to work, a great place to partner with and a great place to invest in"
276,So many thanks for your time today
