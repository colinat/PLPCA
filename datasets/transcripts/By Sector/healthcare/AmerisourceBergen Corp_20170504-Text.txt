Thank you, Keri, and good morning, everyone
I'm pleased to discuss our solid second quarter results and AmerisourceBergen's continued execution within a challenging market
Revenues were up 4% to $37.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS grew 5% compared to previous fiscal year period
There were three key drivers to note for our results this quarter: strong performance across our specialty businesses, good generics volumes growth, and strategic and disciplined management of operating expenses
As a result of this solid performance, we are pleased to be updating aspects of our fiscal year 2017 financial guidance, including tightening our adjusted diluted EPS range as we feel well-positioned moving into the second half of the fiscal year
I continue to be very proud of how AmerisourceBergen is successfully navigating and executing in today's healthcare environment
That execution is driven by the daily contributions of our more than 19,000 associates, so I do want to take a moment to thank them for their dedication and diligence on behalf of our company and our customers
These associates are the foundation of our compelling corporate culture and our success in making AmerisourceBergen a rewarding place to work
Multiple news organizations have again named AmerisourceBergen or one of our business units on their list of best places to work
And DiversityInc recently named us as a 2017 Noteworthy Company, selecting us from a field of more than 1,000 firms evaluated
I believe and studies show that companies with diverse rewarding workplaces deliver better long-term results, so this is an important driver of company growth on many levels
Again, thank you to the AmerisourceBergen team for all that you do
Next, let me take a minute to talk about the U.S
pharmaceutical industry, where AmerisourceBergen has strategically focused its business
While there are challenges, the U.S
pharmaceutical market remains well-positioned for the long term
Key drivers for growth include an aging patient population, an improving U.S
economy, a robust pipeline of new anticipated brand drug launches, and an increasing focus on the relationship between value and outcomes
We see both resilience and continuing growth opportunities in pharmaceuticals and, importantly, we see a vital role for manufacturer and provider services to support the market expansion over time
So, against the backdrop of these market conditions and long-term opportunities, how do we view AmerisourceBergen's role within the broader healthcare landscape
We define that role with our company's new purpose statement, which I think is particularly important in today's environment
At AmerisourceBergen, we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures
Everything we do as a company ties back to this purpose
When we provide services and solutions that improve product access, increase efficiency across the healthcare system, and enhance patient care, all that is done to fulfill our purpose
The value we bring to manufacturers, providers and, most importantly, to patients helps fulfill that responsibility to create healthier futures
Let's talk about how are we delivering on this responsibility and supporting the growth of our customers, while also creating value for our shareholders
We believe there are four key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart and have positioned us for growth
First, we believe we have the best customer base in the business
Our broad and diversified portfolio of growing customers across all our businesses performed well in the second quarter
We enjoy long-standing collaborative relationships with our anchor customers and they continue to be among the best positioned companies in the industry for long-term growth
Walgreens Boots Alliance remains a strong and aligned partner, and we look forward to continuing to expand our relationships to deliver value
We expect to add the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime business in June of this year
Although, the profit contribution will be immaterial this fiscal year and we continue to be optimistic about the future addition of Rite Aid, we are also seeing impressive growth across all other key customers, several large community oncology practices and MWI's largest customers
Additionally, as recently announced, we entered into a five-year strategic contract with Express Scripts for their brand business through 2022. This is a key win for AmerisourceBergen and an illustration of the strong relationships we're able to build with our customers
For the past five years, we worked hard to be the best possible partner and provide the highest levels of service and value to the Express Scripts team
We are proud that those efforts resulted in a new long-term contract agreement and we are excited to continue to collaborate with Express as a distribution service partner of choice
In the last year, our Drug Corporation has also discussed two important customer initiatives and we are making progress on both
First, our efforts to improve compliance and expand our share of wallet within our existing customer base are yielding results and helping us to grow our generics volumes
We've sharpened our focus on reducing leakage and on providing our customers with the tools they need to realize the greatest business benefit of buying within their Prime Vendor Agreement
For example, our investments in Good Neighbor Pharmacy member services are helping to optimize front-end sales
We are providing access to business coaching, manufacturer promotions and new reporting tools that incorporate point of sales data
GNP also entered into a five-year partnership with the National Community Pharmacists Association to produce a series of educational seminars for members
Early response to those services has been extremely positive
We've had 50% growth in the past 12 months across our GNP premier level membership
Second, we are making progress with our Drug Corporation customers on our effort to rebalance our contracts and specialty pricing strategies to better reflect changing market trends and shifts in product mix
This rebalancing effort is one we've embarked on over a year ago and we have made significant progress
Our customers understand the value this restructuring brings in and we continue to establish mutually beneficial adjustments
Throughout AmerisourceBergen, we have the strongest customer base in the industry
We bring the philosophy to be innovative, integrated and indispensable to our customers
We are proud to offer the most advanced and business critical services and solutions to help our customers most efficiently navigate the reimbursement landscape and actively support their growth, especially in a tough healthcare environment
The strength of our business is reinforced by the high quality of our customers and our ability to develop these long-term collaborative partnerships
Working together to advance and enhance patient care, it is always our goal to create customers for life
Our second differentiator is our leadership position in specialty, which puts AmerisourceBergen at the forefront of a rapidly growing market segment
We are very proud of our long-standing leadership in specialty
I should note that when we refer to our leadership here, it includes our market leading position in full-line distribution within our drug company, specialty distribution through our ABSG business and our service offerings to specialty manufacturers ranging from pre to post commercialization support
AmerisourceBergen has a history of strategic investment and leadership in specialty
And in the second quarter, we continued to grow our footprint and capabilities
We are pleased to see continued growth of specialty products available through full-line distribution, affirming the value and efficiency of the Prime Vendor model with many products for customers across multiple sites of care including hospital, health system and community pharmacies
For example, we are seeing strong growth in hospital and health systems use of biosimilar that recently became available in full-line distribution
In the second quarter, our ABSG specialty distribution businesses delivered very strong results with revenue growing double-digits year-over-year
This is the 13th consecutive quarter with that level of growth for this business
Our strong operating income growth was driven by overall volume increases, new drug introductions, expanded indications for existing products and good expense leverage
Our market-leading patient support services, biopharma consulting businesses, and clinical trial logistics businesses provided by Lash Group, Xcenda and World Courier also continue to make important contributions in supporting existing and newly launched specialty products
With our market-leading franchises, AmerisourceBergen is a clear leader in the commercialization, market access and patient support of specialty drugs
We are proud of our trusted partner status and close collaboration with manufacturers and providers to ensure patient access to all types of specialty products
Third, AmerisourceBergen's innovative approach to services and solutions is helping to drive our customers' growth
We at AmerisourceBergen know that we are a healthcare services company
Our value lies in offering our manufacturer and provider customers the most innovative and business critical services and solutions they need to advance their business and drive their growth
Customer adoption of our innovative offerings has been strong, and we believe that is enabling us to grow within our existing customer base now and in the future
For example, our Consulting Services continues to lead the market and demonstrated very strong growth in the fiscal second quarter
We now have more than 5,000 employees in Consulting, working with all top 20 pharmaceutical companies and more than 150 manufacturers in total
Manufacturer services are key to our differentiated upstream value proposition and we continue to grow the breadth and scale of our offerings
The value we provide through our product commercialization services and our consultant strategic approach was just reaffirmed to our senior management team at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores industry meeting when manufacturers called out to us the unique strength of AmerisourceBergen
Another area where we are investing is our design of state-of-the-art distribution centers and our implementation of innovative IT solutions
To improve the customer experience and enhance capacity and operational efficiency, we are strategically building our new state-of-the-art distribution centers for our Drug Corporation business
In the second quarter, we brought our Olive Branch, Mississippi center fully online, both on time and on budget
Olive Branch employs the most leading-edge technology in our industry and is now the largest distribution center in our network
We're excited by the improved capabilities these investments provide and how they position AmerisourceBergen for the future
On the IT front, we are currently building out a new robust technology platform to better support our Lash Group patient services
We're also continuing the phased rollout of our ABC Order platform; a state-of-the-art customer experience and e-commerce system designed by pharmacists for pharmacists that provide the intuitive tools to order effortlessly, manage inventory, access data and information, and resolve any issues quickly
Both of these business critical system investments remain on budget and on track for full implantation
In addition, in January we rolled out a new order analytics module through our Swiss analytics platform, Certio, with generics manufacturers as the initial target
This module offers manufacturers unprecedented insight into the order fulfillment cycle
Order shipment and receiving align for more proactive daily managing of service and inventory levels
The module is an industry-first innovation and demonstrates our commitment to providing increased transparency and incremental value to our manufacture partner through analytics
There are several other information system projects and programs underway across our business, all aimed at increasing efficiency and effectiveness while improving our customer engagement
All of these IT initiatives are examples of why AmerisourceBergen is the trusted data company in our industry
We plan to continue to invest in data solutions, analytics and internal and customer-facing IT capabilities to maintain and grow that position
And finally, our fourth differentiator is our strong history of financial stewardship and proven ability to integrate acquired businesses, which together gives AmerisourceBergen an advantage in driving growth
AmerisourceBergen always takes the strategic approach to capital deployment
We are focusing on investing in the business, strong expense management, building long-term durable growth, and creating significant value for shareholders
We are proud of our ability to integrate our acquisitions smoothly and enhance growth across those businesses
For example, a growth driver in our March quarter was the contribution from our strategic acquisition of MWI Animal Health
MWI delivered another record revenue quarter led by excellent customer retention, strong growth in the U.S
companion pet market, and its doubling of the number of corporate accounts in the past year
Additionally, we are strategically increasing our investment in PharMEDium to support its continued growth
We are committed to the highest levels of product quality and patient safety and, therefore, are enhancing PharMEDium's QA and QC systems
This supports batch level finished product testing prior to product release
The initiative will enable us to deliver the highest levels of product quality and patient safety, while also creating a compelling competitive advantage
These efforts do mean that we will ship fewer units and incur incremental costs as we focus on optimizing the QA systems, resulting in slight bottom line headwind for the business in fiscal year 2017, but we are excited about the progress being made here
Turning to our capital deployment priorities, in the near term, as we've previously communicated, we are planning to pay down our $600 million in debt due this month
Over the longer term, we continue to approach capital deployment strategically and opportunistically and our priorities are as follows
One: invest in the business
As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in infrastructure and quality assurance processes and to enhance our services and solutions product offerings all to better serve our customers and drive organic growth
Two: strategic M&A
We are always evaluating ways we could further add to our value proposition and grow AmerisourceBergen through the addition of best-in-class and market-leading businesses
We are interested in enhancing our broad range of core capabilities to better upstream and downstream customers and build on our proven track records on M&A and success
Three: share repurchases
We are open to and have board authorization for continued buyback of AmerisourceBergen shares, and we will repurchase when we believe it is the optimal way to build shareholder value
And finally, four: dividends
We remain committed to providing shareholders with a reasonable dividend
In summary, we believe AmerisourceBergen is clearly differentiated, strategically focused and delivering undeniable value to our customers and the overall healthcare industry
We remain resilient and have continued to execute in the fiscal second quarter despite market challenges
We remain committed to enabling the growth of our customers, serving patients and delivering value to our shareholders, and we are moving forward with a clear and defined purpose, unified and united in our responsibility to create healthier futures
Now, let me turn the call over to Tim for a more in-depth look at our quarterly financial results and our updated financial guidance
Yeah
I'll start off, Bob
Thanks for the question
Again, our competitors – I think, in many ways, of course, we live in the same environment, but we have lots of differences in our businesses, including capital deployment and generic profile
We're not big, for example, on the spot market, telemarketing, tough (38:51) businesses
I think there also may be some differences in the way that we measure that index now as well, at least we heard on the call recently
So our forecasting method has remained constant
Tim said we are at the top-end of the range and we most certainly are, and we'll have to see how – it's a very fluid market, the generic market, you know as well as I do
And the key determinants are the higher price, the drugs are – the higher priced generic drugs are subject to more competition
Currently, that's an area where I think manufacturers are seeing opportunity, and we could see some more pressure, but right now, we're holding onto that high-end of the 7% to 9% range
Tim, you want to add
It started last year when we go through our planning process
We start that around May every year with it being a September year-end, and recognizing that we weren't going to have the robust industry trends that we had experienced in the past couple of years
And Tim and I spoke to our business heads, and we really instituted some strict expense policies
And ABC had had a pretty good couple of years and I think there were opportunities
We felt there were some opportunities to take some expenses down
Our team is fantastic
Our culture is very receptive to providing good returns to investors
So I think we were very cautious, and it's worked out probably even better than we expected
The expense control has been impressive
Hopefully – certainly to ourselves and, hopefully, to all of you as well
Anything to add, Tim?
Yeah
It's also the first quarter we hadn't lapped
We didn't have any new acquisitions that we hadn't lapped
It's the first quarter where everything had been lapped, so
It's actually, in a couple of months' time, I saw Mick Besse, and it's almost 20 years since we bought Besse Medical, and Lash Group was also 20 years ago
And so, we've had a history, and I think a lot of our management team comes from the specialty group
We've had a history of adding in businesses that expand our services, but are very tied to pharmaceutical care
We absolutely regard businesses like Lash and Xcenda as core businesses
We've talked a lot on this call about our investments in Lash
It's our biggest people business and we detailed the number programs we're doing
So we do regard that as an area of strong capability and strong interest
Again, those markets, those businesses, are not as well developed outside the U.S
In the U.S
, we have very high market share and very strong customer relationships and a lot of opportunities to deploy capital to be more efficient
So that's often how we think about it
So areas of focus for us are international specialty, which is an emerging area
We look at a lot of companies
We start with – FCPA is critical to us and the type of partners
We've learned a lot from our pro forma experience, so I think that's very illustrative to us
And one thing we believe we've done very well there is choose our partners
We've done really well with the specialty JV
Innomar in Canada is another good example of success that we've had where we are leading the specialty market there
So those are the sort of characteristics of a market we like
MWI is – certainly, one of the reasons they joined ABC, is for international development, and we've done some in the U.K
Jim and his team are very active
I think we'd be disappointed if, in the next few years, we didn't get something done there
We think there's opportunities and we have technology to deploy particularly on the lot feeding production side, where the customers seem to be very sticky and we think, as land becomes more scarce, there will be a trend towards lot feedings
Those are some of the key themes
Tim has one thing he wants to say, no?
First of all, the business is ahead of what our acquisition model is
I would say we had an exceptional first year there
And I think this year, we're strengthening the team
We're happy with Jenn Adams, who's leading that business for us and was the Head of Sales and she's had a long history of the business, what she's doing
We called it out because we've had some reduction in the quantities that they are producing and it's because of some very, really, ahead of the market, ahead of legislation procedures that we've decided to adopt around testing
But we're doing all that internally
It's certainly nothing – I haven't heard of a connection with Charles River or anything
It's just really making sure we stay ahead of the quality curve, making sure we stay ahead of regulators
We are several times the size of any other competitors in that space and, of course, the regulators look to us to set the standard
So that's absolutely what we're doing and we feel good about the quality and the competitive edge that AmerisourceBergen and PharMEDium have, and we think our customers have also been very, very supportive
So we like the business and we continue invest in it
So, I think that covered all your questions
Yeah, Garen, that's tough, right? Anytime you look at one key – it is a key assumption and we track it, but it's hard to look at anything in isolation
In any business you're going to have puts and takes, you're going to have things go in different ways
But we have a $0.15 range
We felt that was important in the second half of the year because of brand pricing and generic pricing
So I really – certainly, that would be a headwind, but we'd have to see how it fits in with other puts and takes
Yeah, we knew a cash flow question was coming, Bob
Well, we are very proud
You'll recall that when this contract was signed first time five years ago, we really came from well behind to become the combined Express Scripts and Medco distributor
That was – we were very proud of that at the time and we're proud to continue
I think we were disappointed that we didn't get called wickedly good again on the press release
We thought that was a really neat adjective
But I think that we had some other great descriptions, future derisked, or
So we struggle to keep up with the eloquence of our CEO colleague, my CEO colleague at Express Scripts
But the agreement is largely as it was before, no big changes on terms
We were very mindful, of course, of changes in mixes which you'd expect us to do and is a theme with all of our customers from big to small, how the mix would change and what sort of contemplation of newer therapies like biosimilars, maybe cell-based therapies, but this framework gives us an opportunity to partner in really any category, and that's what we're excited about and there's also lots of good business reasons for us to work with Express on, say, networks, et cetera
We continue to do that
And we're really proud that they selected us and also for a five-year term, which we think is very significant with a company that is so scaled in our industry
So that's about all I'd say
You know what? Thanks for the question
We talked a lot about how robust the generic sales were
In fact, we now have over 4,500 GNP and Elevate customers
And that's, I think, one of the key things that Tim and I judge our management team on is, we're making these investments, what's it doing in the marketplace? And we are really pleased with how Elevate and GNP Premier are progressing
Part of the CPA renewal was to bring all their members onto Premier level membership
Our view is certainly one that may be it could be a little bit biased, but we believe it that GNP Premier members are more successful
We have data to show that
They're more integrated with us and we have peer-to-peer information that could show they're the most successful pharmacy
And we believe they're the most reliant customers
They're customers we don't have to worry about on compliance, et cetera
So we had a very good quarter with independents and we expect it to continue
But growing within our customer base and increasing that market share, so we've had very nice pickup on compliance and part of that is tools and part of it is emphasis
In my experience, if you point sales people in the right way and tell them what you want to accomplish, and we've been very clear that we expect to get compliance out of the contracts that we have, that we've signed and we think are very fair to our customers
So probably that's all to say there
Next question, please?
Hi, Lisa
Yeah, I think two years ago, one buying group switched, and we've talked about that a lot
And again, the buying groups, it's tough for them to switch because it is a shared relationship and most of us have had those customers for a long time
So we've been talking about this for a long time
It's competitive
It's always been competitive
I think we face competition amongst our peers
We also face competition with reimbursement rates and making sure that our customers can stay in networks
And I always talk about this that we have three key missions at AmerisourceBergen in terms of smaller customers, and that's community veterinarians, community oncologists and retail pharmacies, and our goal there is to help them be successful as independent businesses and looking at all the forces that they have to contend with
So, think about a standalone business and how do we help them? So that's why we do GNP and Elevate, that's why we do business coaching, and we do these type of things, clinical programs, we do these type of things across all three businesses
And one of the things that brings me great interest and satisfaction is when we can look at combined programs that benefit each of those groups, and we're seeing that a lot
Obviously, there's enormous differences between, say, an oncologist and a veterinarian, but there's a lot of things that they have in common, and we work on that, and we have a lot of shared experience
But I would also say we've got a lot of good mobile tools now, so those reps that go out on the field, they do have key data points that they can share with customers about how compliance benefits them
We've worked very hard with our buying group customers, the management of those buying group customers to say we've been transparent, we're giving you the great price, this is how compliance benefits both of us
This is what we expect to get
This is what best in class looks like, and I think that that's been very productive
And then I go back to those suite of services and solutions, the customers are realizing value, and I think that that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
As they realize the value, they become more adherent and we do better through that
So it's always been competitive
We haven't picked up any new buying group customers
Some of our buying groups are growing, but nothing exceptional
We are really pleased with the pickup in compliance rate, but we're not complacent
We think there's more
We want to see that compliance rate be in the 90%s, so that's our long term goal
So, we'll start servicing Prime next month, so it's really more of a fourth quarter event
A lot of it is specialty
The Alliance JV, Prime Alliance JV is mainly specialty products, and we were expecting it
And I think the relationship we have with WBA is enormously successful, and we have incredibly close interaction with them, and we expect that business that comes into their orbit becomes ABC business, and that's why we did the 10-year agreement, we did WBAD, the warrants, et cetera
All of these were planned out four years ago, and we're proud as to how it's working out in the real world, and it is over four years now into that relationship
And we've been proud to help WBA grow, and make sure that anybody they bring into their sphere significantly becomes an ABC customer as well
So that's really been the goal, and that's what we're seeing with Prime
Tim, do you want to just – anything on the top line volume that we've come to expect (61:35)?
Thank you, everybody
Thank you for the questions
Our prepared remarks are a bit long, so we appreciate your attention, but we're just very proud of the quarter
I think we are achieving so many of our goals, say, in generic compliance and the technology deployments, and we also are very proud on the softer side of the recognition we're getting in areas like diversity
Internally, the purpose, united in our responsibility to create healthier futures has been very well received, very uplifting, and again, AmerisourceBergen proves to be a great place to work, a great place to partner with and a great place to invest in
So many thanks for your time today
