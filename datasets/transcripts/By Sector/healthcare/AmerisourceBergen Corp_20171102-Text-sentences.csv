0,"Thanks, Steve"
1,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us"
2,I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results
3,"Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results, and growth rates and comparisons that are made are against the prior-year quarter unless otherwise noted"
4,"As Steve mentioned, we're very pleased with the progress we made this fiscal year, especially in several key areas such as improving generic compliance levels, resigning key customers like Express Scripts and, importantly, continuing to grow our specialty distribution and services businesses"
5,Our continued execution has allowed us to successfully navigate in what has remained a challenging healthcare environment
6,"We are confident that our overall strategy, combined with that ability to consistently execute will enable us to drive sustainable growth"
7,This morning I will provide commentary in three main areas
8,"First, I will highlight our fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance"
9,"Next, I will spend a few minutes on our fiscal 2017 full year performance"
10,And the third area I will cover are fiscal 2018 expectations
11,Let's begin with our Q4 2017 results
12,"We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS at $1.33, an increase of 2% and in line with our expectations"
13,"As Steve highlighted, we're extremely pleased with our operations teams' comprehensive preparations and rapid coordinated response to the recent hurricanes"
14,These efforts resulted in the safety of our associates and no major issues for our facilities
15,"I should mention our revenues were slightly impacted from these events, including shipments from our PharMEDium facility in Sugar Land, Texas"
16,"Overall, our EPS was impacted, we estimate, by about $0.01."
17,"Our consolidated revenues were $39 billion, up 4%, while having one less business day in the quarter compared to last year"
18,"We also continued unfortunately to experience a headwind from lower hepatitis C revenues this quarter, consistent with the overall U.S"
19,market trends
20,"As an illustration, excluding this headwind from hep C and also adjusting for the one less business day, our revenue growth would have been 7%"
21,"Operating income; our adjusted operating income was $471 million, up $7 million or 1.5%, with our operating margin down four basis points"
22,"As expected, we had higher operating expenses in the fourth quarter"
23,"The expected costs associated with bringing our five new distribution centers on-line dampened our operating income growth, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the OpEx increase"
24,"Moving below the operating income line, income taxes"
25,"Our adjusted income tax rate was 32.5% for the current quarter, up some from last year"
26,"Unlike previous quarters this fiscal year, the current September quarter had an insignificant benefit from the accounting rule change regarding share-based compensation"
27,I should also highlight that last year's September quarter had a favorable true-up adjustment for our 2016 tax expense
28,This caused a headwind in the current quarter of about 110 basis points on the tax rate
29,"Our adjusted net income decreased about 1% to $293 million, primarily as a result of the items I just covered, including the tax headwind"
30,Our adjusted diluted share count decreased about 6.5 million shares or 3% year-over-year to 221 million shares
31,"In the September quarter, we repurchased about $100 million worth of shares and we end the year with $790 million remaining on our current board share repurchase authorization"
32,Moving over to cash flow
33,"We are extremely pleased with our Q4 free cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion, a record quarter"
34,This was much better than we anticipated as a result of our revenue mix and also a heightened focus on our inventory levels and turns
35,This finishes the review of our consolidated results
36,"Next, let me switch and cover our segment results"
37,"Before I start, let me highlight that in conjunction with our transformation efforts and as highlighted in our press release this morning, we combined the Legacy Drug company and Legacy Specialty operating segments into a single operating segment, effective September 30, 2017."
38,This conference call will be the last time I'll make any reference to the Specific Drug and Specialty businesses
39,"Additionally, we moved two of our businesses between our reportable segments"
40,"One of the businesses that moved, TheraCom distribution, a high revenue business with low margins within our consulting group and the other segment was moved to our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment"
41,As a result of these changes we have restated the segment results for all prior reported periods
42,These changes had an immaterial impact on segment operating results and will be fully highlighted in our 10-K
43,"With that, we can begin our review with Pharmaceutical Distribution"
44,Total segment revenues were $3.7 billion up 4%
45,"Legacy Drug Company had solid revenue growth up 4%; not only did this business have to lap lower hepatitis C revenues as we mentioned earlier, but the business continued to be disproportionately impacted from brand and generic conversions by certain large customers"
46,"As an example, the segment lost 140 basis points of revenue growth year-over-year from lower revenues associated with just the top three brand drugs that previously converted and had been holding share"
47,"In the past, brand inflation provided a partial revenue offset to conversions"
48,But inflation has been less impactful this year
49,"And, I should point out with certain large customers upon conversion to the generic drug we do not always retain the prescription volume"
50,Our Legacy Specialty business which primarily distributes specialty drugs to physician practices continued with market leading revenue growth of just over 10% percent; notably the 15th consecutive quarter of this level of performance
51,"Growth was driven by increased volumes especially in Oncology and to a lesser degree, in MS, Ophthalmology and Plasma"
52,We continue to see strong volume and revenue growth from Immuno-oncology drugs due to expanded indications and overall market growth
53,Segment operating income was $399 million and essentially flat
54,Our Legacy Specialty Group led the way with excellent growth which was offset by the expected lower contribution from the Drug company
55,Two items negatively impacted our Drug company business
56,"The first item, last quarter we specifically highlighted that Q4 would have higher OpEx due primarily to the go-live dates of five distribution centers"
57,The original go-live date for the DCs had been spring 2017 in order to coincide with the anticipated timing of the new Walgreen's Rite Aid business
58,"Despite the deceleration of opening these DCs, the Drug company had to eventually bring the DCs online and was therefore burdened with some incremental OpEx ahead of onboarding the new business"
59,"And the second item, our PharMEDium business experienced an increase in sequential shipping volumes in Q4, so we are pleased with their progress at increasing throughput while having best-in-class QC procedures"
60,"However, the business was still down in terms of year-over-year performance"
61,Some of this headwind is timing related to lower demand at PharMEDium's Texas facility as a result of the Houston hurricane
62,"Overall, we are making progress in the Pharmaceutical Distribution services segment despite macro industry challenges"
63,"We continue to see growth in order lines shipped, including pro-generics order lines"
64,"We have an efficient modernized distribution network, and we've made key technology investments, most of which center around redefining the customer experience and enabling our customers to more effectively operate their businesses"
65,We can now move to the Other segment
66,"This includes World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI, businesses that focus on global commercialization services and animal health"
67,In the quarter total revenues were a record at just under $1.5 billion up about 12%
68,All three businesses contributed meaningfully to the revenue growth
69,World Courier had a record number of shipments in the quarter
70,"MWI had strong volume and revenue growth, especially in Companion Animal and to a lesser degree in Production Animal"
71,"From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $72 million up 8%"
72,"As a reminder, there is some seasonality in the MWI business with Q4 typically being their lowest profit quarter"
73,"Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the core fundamental of the three businesses in Other"
74,All remain the undisputed market leaders in their effective sectors
75,I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal 2017 full year consolidated financial items
76,"Revenue; our full year growth was a solid 4%, and this includes a negative 130 basis points impact due to lower Hepatitis C revenues"
77,"Additionally, the current fiscal year had two less business days than the prior year, making for an unusual comparison"
78,"Adjusting for these two items, our overall revenue growth would have been 6.5%"
79,"As a note, in fiscal 2018, we will stay flat in terms of business days"
80,"Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues"
81,"ABSG, our Legacy Specialty business, finished the year at $31.5 billion, with revenue growth of just over 10%"
82,Another outstanding year for this business
83,"Our adjusted operating income was almost flat for the year, ending about 1% down at a total of roughly $2 billion"
84,"Our adjusted operating margin finished at 1.32%, a decrease of six basis points"
85,"While navigating a tough healthcare environment this year, we executed extremely well, especially in a priority area"
86,"We grew our PROGenerics business, with order lines up over 10% and made significant improvement in customer compliance rates"
87,"Unfortunately, this wasn't enough to fully offset gross profit headwinds from changes in manufacturer pricing practices and key customer renewals carried forward from fiscal 2016."
88,"EPS; our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.88, up about 5%, due to operational execution and our ability to maintain our operating income level, despite the current market environment"
89,And our EPS benefited from a lower tax rate and reduced share count
90,"Free cash flow, as highlighted earlier; we had an exceptionally strong finish and this resulted in fiscal 2017 free cash flow of just over $1 billion"
91,This free cash flow number is net of the $260 million litigation payment we made at the end of September
92,"Excluding the litigation payment, our free cash flow was about 100% of our adjusted net income"
93,"We ended the year with roughly $2.4 billion in total cash, of which $1 billion was held offshore"
94,We enter fiscal 2018 with great financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet
95,"Our adjusted debt leverage is well under two times, and we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business and be opportunistic if strategic opportunities present themselves"
96,Now let's turn to fiscal 2018 expectations
97,"Before I start working through the specific guidance items, I will comment on three key working assumptions"
98,"First, let's start with brand manufactured drug pricing"
99,"During fiscal 2017 our brand inflation finished right at 7%, and this includes fewer price increases and at lower rates in our fourth quarter"
100,"Based on these trends as we think about fiscal 2018, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to 6% to 7%"
101,"Next, generic manufactured drug pricing"
102,"Current trends indicate that the generic buy side deflation rate has not worsened, which is a positive"
103,"Our deflation rate, which is calculated specifically for our business remains stable in the high single-digit percentage range"
104,"This elevated level presents a continued headwind that we need to work to offset, primarily achieved through increasing volumes and over the long-term, optimizing our margins for brand, specialty and generic drugs"
105,"For fiscal 2018, we are forecasting that the generic buy side deflation range will remain a negative 7% to negative 9%"
106,"And finally, the third key working assumption, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-over-year"
107,We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal 2018.
108,Revenues; we expect consolidated revenue growth in the 7% to 9% range
109,This growth includes the onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores which will happen over an extended time period and finish near the end of our third fiscal quarter
110,"From a segment standpoint, both Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and Other are expected to grow in the same 7% to 9% range"
111,"Consolidated gross profit; we don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but to repeat previous commentary, our priorities continue to be one: grow our overall PROGenerics volumes"
112,"However, we expect that fiscal 2018 will be at a slower pace than fiscal 2017."
113,Two: continue to source generic drugs cost effectively
114,Three: successfully and efficiently onboard the new Rite Aid business
115,And four: price appropriately to receive fair compensation
116,"As always, it's our objective that these items will help offset assumed manufacturer pricing pressures"
117,"Consolidated operating expenses; as mentioned last quarter in fiscal 2018, we will have a mismatch of certain operating expenses such as the new DC costs and duplicate IT costs before we are fully optimized with either additional run rate revenues or expected savings from technology efficiencies"
118,"Consequently, we expect OpEx growth in the range of 4% to 6% in fiscal 2018."
119,"As always, we remain diligent in managing our OpEx and continually look for ways to streamline and gain efficiencies, which is an imperative in a rapidly evolving U.S"
120,healthcare market
121,Consolidated adjustment operating income; we expect to grow operating income between 3% and 5%
122,"Our operating margin will be down 2 to 7 basis points primarily due to mix, meaning higher growth rates within our largest customers"
123,"Importantly, from a segment standpoint we expect the following"
124,Pharmaceutical Distribution Services
125,; we remain in the midst of our efforts to transition customer contracts to more balanced pricing to help offset lower contributions from generics
126,"As a result, we expect the segment's operating income growth to be also between 3% and 5%"
127,"The segment will benefit from the new Walgreens Rite Aid business, however given the anticipated onboarding schedule, it's likely that only the fourth fiscal quarter will have the full benefit of all the new pharmacies"
128,Commercialization Services and Animal Health
129,; this group is a key differentiator for ABC and will remain so going forward
130,We're projecting continued strong growth for MWI and World Courier
131,"However, for fiscal 2018, we do expect the group's overall growth will slow to 3% to 6% due to the timing of and the expected operating expenses associated with our full Fusion implementation"
132,Fusion is our new technology system in our Lash consulting business
133,"The nature of any consulting business, including one like Lash Consulting, is that it requires new contract wins each year to maintain the normal course of running and ultimately growing the business"
134,"As we forecast the year, we are building in the impact the new platform will have on our customer capacity including converting existing customers"
135,We are projecting a more limited business ramp for Lash during this Fusion transition period
136,Our Fusion system is a game changer
137,"It is a best-in-class patient support system that will provide a significant competitive advantage for Lash, be highly valued by our manufacturer partners, and also enable a better patient experience"
138,And because of this we are confident that our Consulting business group will ramp at the end of fiscal 2018 and return to its normal level of growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond
139,"Moving below the operating income line, tax rate"
140,Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of about 32% to 33%
141,"This is a slightly higher tax rate versus fiscal 2017 due to one-time benefits from R&D tax credits that won't repeat in fiscal 2018, a higher mix of U.S"
142,"income, somewhat offset by continued tax initiatives"
143,"Share repurchases; our guidance assumes modest share buybacks, generally enough to offset the dilutive impact from employee exercises"
144,"As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment, depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions"
145,Adjusted EPS
146,; we expect our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.15.
147,Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression
148,"We expect our second half of fiscal 2018 EPS growth to be much better than our first half EPS growth, due primarily to the benefit of the gradual onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores as previously discussed"
149,"Switching to our cash flow; first, CapEx is expected to be about $325 million"
150,"Roughly 60% of this CapEx spend relates to key projects that are being carried over from fiscal 2017 and, for the most part, will be completed during fiscal 2018."
151,"The projects include the completion of two remaining distribution centers and strategic technology system investments like ABC Order, our new customer order-entry system, Fusion which we just discussed, and Nova, our new logistics system which is the backbone of our World Courier business"
152,Free cash flow
153,"; we expect our free cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, for fiscal 2018 to be $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion"
154,"Revenue growth and mix between brand and generic sales, each of which have distinct cash conversion metrics, are the drivers that can move us within the range"
155,"In closing, let me reiterate that we are actively investing in and advancing our business to address the evolving healthcare market"
156,"We want to be the most important partner to our customers, and a critical driver of their growth"
157,"Our people, services and systems are innovative and differentiate ABC, enabling us to deliver for our customers and importantly for our shareholders"
158,"We at AmerisourceBergen are proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2017, and we are looking forward to continuing to deliver in fiscal 2018."
159,We appreciate your interest in ABC
160,Now here is Keri to start our Q&A
161,"Hi, Eric"
162,"Yes, our, we've been consistent"
163,Our free cash flow target has been â€“ adjusted free cash flow
164,125% of adjusted net income
165,We feel good about our target for fiscal 2018.
166,I would say that our range maps to our target
167,"And as you think about that range, the puts and takes, it certainly allows for revenue growth"
168,"I mean at the end of the day, two key factors would be the revenue growth and then certainly the mix of that revenue between brand and generic both of which have very distinct working capital metrics"
169,"So those are kind of the puts and takes, but we're pleased with our target"
170,"And as always, we'll work to achieve it"
171,"Thanks, George, for the question and good morning"
172,"On Rite Aid, we â€“ in Steve's script, I think he called out that we're already starting to ship to a few stores, we'll onboard"
173,We'll see a pickup
174,We'll see a pickup on that onboarding in calendar 2018.
175,"We'll be done onboarding in spring, so really before our June quarter"
176,And I think it's important
177,"I mean, I called out that really, the fourth quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter, is really the first quarter that we'll have all the volume"
178,"And so again, it's helpful"
179,It's certainly helpful
180,It's a part of our revenue growth
181,And I â€
182,“ but I think we're really pleased with our guidance
183,Our revenue growth is 7% to 9%
184,That's only â€
185,"“ that's a portion of it, but if you take out Rite Aid, we're really pleased that we're still growing significantly above the market, especially in our Specialty business"
186,"Oh, no"
187,"Kevin, that â€"
188,“ this is Tim
189,"Certainly, we guided for modest capital deployments in the share repurchase area"
190,"As we do every year, we always enter the year assuming that we will do an amount that will offset the dilutive impact"
191,So our working assumption always entering the year is to make sure we keep our share count flat
192,"And then during the year, depending on cash flow and other priorities, we'll adjust accordingly"
193,"Steve, that was awesome, and I would just say, just remind our listeners, again we are not only ABC but the sector"
194,We are extremely efficient at what we do for a very fair margin and taking title
195,And also I think we continue to invest
196,"Again, we're on a little bit of the offensive here, where we continue to invest in leading edge solutions to service our customers and ultimately the patients even better"
197,"Yes, I would just say, John, the one thing, and we've always said this, we've been very consistent"
198,", there's certainly a firewall between ABC and a wholesaler and manufacturers in terms of pricing"
199,We're notified
200,They send us e-Mails and PDFs when they adjust pricing and that's when we learn about it
201,"Yep, hi, Dave"
202,"We had a little bit of a cost in Q3 again sequentially, but the DCs were not open for the entire third quarter"
203,"When we got to the fourth quarter, we had all five DCs virtually open"
204,The costs don't abate as we move forward
205,That's kind of the run rate for those five new DCs entering into 2018.
206,"But, again, I think the key point"
207,there is we start to have new revenue and Rite-Aid revenue also coming on
208,So there's just a better match of revenue and OpEx
209,So hopefully that answers your question
210,"But when we, last time we gave our earnings back in, for Q3, we thought that maybe our OpEx in 2018 would be slightly higher"
211,"Again, we weren't done with our plan process"
212,We commented on that on the last call
213,We've gone back to businesses
214,We've worked hard
215,We pressure tested and we're really pleased with our OpEx growth for 2018 of 4% to 6%
216,"Thanks, Glen, and welcome back"
217,"The way to think about it, we, the 4% to 6%, at one point â€“ again, I kind of go back to the June quarter, we thought there might be some transformation OpEx that we might need"
218,Nothing is contemplated right now
219,"We, at this point, we don't think we need anything"
220,So it's not in that 4% to 6%
221,"But I think importantly, as you think about our OpEx, we're not â€"
222,"“ again, 4% to 6% is high"
223,I mean we're in an evolving healthcare market
224,We need to do better than 4% to 6% and that's our objective
225,So we're going
226,see that 4% to 6% in fiscal 2018.
227,"As we move into fiscal 2019, that should come down to what I would say should be a more normalized rate because we start to eliminate duplicate systems and we start to gain efficiency"
228,"So clearly, our objective is to move into 2019 and start to realize the benefits from all that CapEx that we've had"
229,"I think Steve, well said"
230,"I mean certainly, we're focused on sell-side"
231,"We've talked about that, communicated"
232,We're make really good progress
233,"As Steve mentioned earlier, I think in Q&A, we have more room to go there"
234,"But again, we just need to make sure we get fair compensation for each category class of drugs that we sell the customer and those are ongoing discussions"
235,We're making progress
