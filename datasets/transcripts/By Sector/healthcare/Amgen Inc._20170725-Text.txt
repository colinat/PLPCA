Thank you, David, and you'll find the sales details starting on slide number 10. We delivered a strong solid quarter with sales increasing 2% year-over-year
Prolia and our more recently launched brands including Repatha and KYPROLIS continue to deliver strong volume growth
We are focused on their near-term growth and realizing their long-term potential as the product portfolio continues to transom
For the quarter, sales in the U.S
increased 2% year-over-year while sales outside the U.S
increased 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange or 3% including
Internationally we had double-digit volume growth led by our European business
Let me begin first with Prolia
Prolia sales increased 15% with an 18% volume growth year-over-year, with share gains in both the U.S
and our international markets
Prolia continues to offer a unique opportunity to both post-menopausal osteoporosis patients as well as Amgen
There are currently about 3.5 million patients on Prolia globally relatively equally distributed across the regions, about 1 million in the U.S
, about 1.6 million in Europe and the rest of the world about 1 million
Elderly patients who suffer bone fractures often become bedridden and face potential loss of their independence
This places an enormous economic burden on society and less than half the diagnosed patients are treated, raising the need for improved education and treatment guidelines
This is what we as a company are focusing on next
Prolia's average share of treated patients is around 20%, both in the U.S
and globally
However, there are some countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Ireland, where better diagnosis and treatment rates for osteoporosis have led to Prolia having 50% share or better
These are countries that truly understand the societal cost of non-intervention
Prolia has a strong clinical profile with a proven ability to reduce risk of fractures
Combined with solid long-term safety data spanning over 10 years and a convenient twice per year administration schedule, Prolia will remain an important growth driver and we will continue to target our commercial efforts on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of these patients
KYPROLIS grew 23% year-over-year, led by our successful launch efforts across existing and new markets outside the United States
Uptake continues to be robust across the launch markets with a 20% sequential volume growth
As Bob mentioned, KYPROLIS has developed two sets of exciting overall survival data in relapsed multiple myeloma patients this year
Earlier in the year in the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study against VELCADE, we demonstrated that the KRYPOLIS arm reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved overall survival by about eight months compared to the VELCADE arm
Just recently, the ASPIRE study demonstrated that adding KYPROLIS to REVLIMID and dexamethasone also reduced the risk of death by 21% and improves survival by about eight months
It is clear
Multiple myeloma patients live longer when treated with KYPROLIS
With these two new sets of overall survival data, our message to physicians is simple and powerful
When multiple myeloma relapses, don't put your patient's survival at risk
KYPROLIS-based regimens KRd and Kd reduce the risk of death by 21% versus Rd and Vd and extended overall survival by 7.9 and 7.6 months respectively
This data will also help community oncologists better understand the risk/benefit ratio of profile of KYPROLIS versus other options
XGEVA grew 4% year-over-year, mostly due to volume
We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label in 2018, which will expand the eligible patient population and provide a new growth opportunity for XGEVA
For Nplate and Vectibix, we continue to see strong volume growth in both brands
Vectibix has now over 50% share of the U.S
EGFR segment
Our recent label update, which includes expanded RAS testing, demonstrates Amgen's ongoing commitment to using cutting edge science and technology to target treatments to patients most likely to benefit
Turning now to Neulasta
We continue to drive adoption of Neulasta Onpro, exiting the second quarter with about 55% share of Neulasta sales
The treatment and convenience benefits to patients and providers is clear, as penetration continues to improve in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens
I'd point out, however, as we look at the cancer therapy in total, PD1s and other new novel therapies are causing a low single digit decline in the usage of myelosuppressive agents
We've also seen a small share loss internationally and we believe these factors contributed to the year-over-year decline of about 5%
The quarter-over-quarter decline of 10% was primarily due to heavier purchasing by certain end customers and favorable accounting adjustments in the first quarter
We expect the trend in myelosuppressive regimens to continue for the remainder of the year
I'd point out, however, that in spite of decreased use of myelosuppressive regimens, there has been an increase in the number of hospital admissions for febrile neutropenia and we continue to focus on improving penetration for the benefit of patients and for the reduction of unnecessary hospitalization costs
Looking forward, I'd remind you that the fourth quarter of 2016 also included a single $38 million purchase from the U.S
government
NEUPOGEN declined 30% year-over-year
The impact of short-acting biosimilar competition on NEUPOGEN in the U.S
was in line with prior trends
We exited the second quarter holding 44% share for the short-acting segment and importantly have maintained pricing discipline over the three-plus years since NEUPOGEN first faced competition in the U.S
We expect the competitive dynamic to continue through the rest of 2017. Enbrel sales declined 1% year-over-year but increased 24% on a quarter-over-quarter basis
In the first quarter, you'll recall that market volume growth rates in both rheumatology and dermatology segments had contracted from recent levels
As we expected, in the second quarter, market volume growth improved in both segments
We expect year-over-year segment growth trends to approximate these recent levels for the balance of the year
Sequentially, our unit share was relatively stable in both rheumatology and dermatology, declining less than 1 percentage point to 31% in rheumatology and 15% in dermatology
Changes in net selling price had a positive impact on Enbrel's sequential growth
Recall that quarter one was negatively impacted by increased commercial co-pay assistance
As calculated on a full year basis, we continue to expect year-over-year impact of changes in net selling price to be negligible
We estimate that we exited the second quarter with a balance of about $140 million of excess end-user inventory
We expect a portion of this excess inventory to deplete through the remaining of the year
In summary, we saw improvement in the underlying segment performance this quarter versus the prior quarter and our share trajectory continues as previously projected
Enbrel has a strong track record of safety and efficacy in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis
We continue to believe the long-term dynamics are intact and continue to invest in Enbrel to remain competitive in these growing segments
Aranesp grew 6% year-over-year, primarily from volume growth, which includes a benefit from some timing of tenders in certain markets outside the U.S
versus the prior year
With EPOGEN, we've been executing our lifecycle management strategy by successfully transitioning much of the dialysis business to Aranesp and extending our supply contract with DaVita through 2022. The transition to Aranesp is largely complete and the second quarter year-over-year decline in EPOGEN is primarily due to lower net prices as a result of the DaVita agreement
We believe that for now our EPOGEN volumes have stabilized
Sensipar year-over-year growth of 10% was mainly due to net selling price and to a lesser extent unit growth
We continue to await CMS guidance on the reimbursement mechanism for Parsabiv
Parsabiv launch is underway in Europe with seven markets so far and three more expected by year-end
In conclusion, let me turn to Repatha
We continue to extend our market leadership across the U.S
and Europe
We now hold 58% share of the PCSK9 segment in both markets, with sequential growth points of 4% in the U.S
and 2 points in Europe
More importantly in the U.S
, new-to-brand patient share averaged 70% in the second quarter
Since March, and the presentation of the positive Repatha outcomes data, we have been engaging with payers to improve their utilization of management criteria and processes to improve access for appropriate patients
Payers and PBMs acknowledge the benefit to patients demonstrated by the outcomes data and are evaluating changes to their processes
We continue to believe that Repatha will grow steadily as guidelines and clinical pathways are revised and the outcome data are in our label
We look forward to the publication of the final update of the ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway, an important reference for physicians
Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number one cause of death and disability in the world
Repatha has the potential to help millions of patients around the world dealing with this grievous illness
Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff who worked so hard and tirelessly to get important products to patients around the world
I'll now provide you (26:00) to Dr
Matt, it's Tony
So let me get back to discussing the inventory
So inventory, as we said, we report at a point in time
So it's either on March 31 or it is June 30. So it's an endpoint
What we have in hand is we know exactly what the revenue numbers are in terms of ex-factory sales
We also understand what our in-market demand is based on the IMS retail prescriptions, which are about 90% accurate and 10% predicted
We also understand exactly what is held by the wholesalers because of our contracts with them and the triangulation between how much has been sold from wholesalers to end users minus the demand leaves us with a number which we then extrapolate as being the end-user inventory
So clearly what happens is, at the beginning of the quarter, there's a drawdown of that inventory, which we did see in April-May this year, and then there appeared to be a build towards the end of June
So what I'm saying is we ended the quarter with an excess of about $140 million of inventory, which I would expect to burn off the majority of that during the rest of the year
So I mean, it's clear to us, Eric, that in our discussion with the payers, they do pay very careful attention to position papers and the guidelines coming from these bodies
And the National Lipid Association is a subdivision of the AHA
So it's clear that they're making those decisions on that regard
The ACC, of course, has always been the grand-daddy of guidelines and people will pay definitive attention and look at how they will be actually servicing patients aligned with these position papers or pathways that the ACC are put into place
So we're working extensively with them at the moment
As Sean says, as the weight of evidence continues to build around the importance of delivering Repatha to patients who do have this particular disease
So, Geoff, it's Tony
I mean, one, we've never given pricing guidance prior to a launch
Aimovig is going into a patient population that are uniquely different from a symptomatic perspective, right
So we estimate about 3.4 million patients presently on prophylactic treatment for migraine, both episodic and chronic, which is a crippling disease resulting in mothers not being able to be mothers, or employees not being able to do their work
And our discussions have been with payers from a clinical perspective at this particular stage as we move things forward
And there's a huge unmet need, and we're busy developing our pharmaco-economic value-based pricing models for this particular disease
It's going to be a competitive market
That we understand
But our pricing will be made as we get closer to the launch time
So when we look at the actual usage in the marketplace, right, there are sort of three patient segments that are pathing to us that are clearly indicated inside the label, and aware physicians are starting to understand they're important to treat, right
These are patients who have ASCVD, who've had two events in the last 24 months, clearly high-risk patients or what we call higher high-risk patients
They are those who have ACS who have had an event in the last year or so with ASCVD
And then there's the FH population
And that's a fairly large population, and we've seen the majority of our patients coming from that group at the moment
If you look at the NRx data, which is really looking at the new-to-brand prescriptions in terms of new patient capture, you are seeing that we are gaining market share there and gaining traction consistency in terms of getting patients
When you look inside the data and you see that our abandonment rate by commercial patients has gone down to about 24%, it is clear that we are assisting patients who can't afford their co-pay or their deductible
So we're getting a higher access to patients there
So we see a continued usage and expansion by existing physicians
We are capturing about between 300 and 400 new prescribers per month, so the prescriber base is growing as we go forward
The new guidelines are starting to take a little bit of traction
We look forward to the ACC presentations
So that's where we see the growth of our business right now
So, Geoff, let me take that one as best I can in the moment
So just to remind you, that the outcomes data was presented at the ACC in March
We are not promoting that data at the moment
We are clearly awaiting the FDA decision to include the data in our label, at which stage we will start being able to promote that data into the marketplace itself
We are working consistently with the payers at the moment in terms of reevaluating and challenging some of the utilization management criteria, challenging some of the onerous processes that are in place and actually working with the professional bodies themselves so they become involved in ensuring they can get access to their patients
We have seen a high level of willingness from the payers and the PBMs to relook at their utilization management criteria to ensure that the processes are reasonable
The cohorts are probably a bit too small to be able to really understand patient persistency at the moment, so what we are tracking is new patient capture early on, and as you know, you can see that quite easily from the IMS data
And that continues to grow as well as the growth trial as (55:06) we go forward
We do believe that once the FDA ratifies the data and puts it in the label, we'll be in a much better position to see an opening of access through the payers
Okay
So let me start doing a little bit of an answer there if I can, and perhaps Sean can add around the clinical data
Right, so just to go back, my comment to Geoff earlier on, around the unmet need, the more we dig into this market, the more you realize that not only patients but specialist physicians themselves have been absolutely frustrated for decades because of the inability to actually prescribe a migraine drug for a migraine
They've used substitutes
They've used drugs that have caused huge side effects, and patients are unhappy with them
So as we've talked to patients, patient bloggers, patient groups about their needs, it's clear the unmet need continues to be large
Every specialist I've spoken to who looked at the Aimovig data has been impressed by the data, has seen a dramatic potential for change in what this will do for patients on their day-to-day lives
We do believe that we will be first to market
We have submitted first
We intend coming to market first
We have a partnership with Novartis who have an existing strong relationship with the neurologists, a lot of them who treat migraine
And we expect to be using their skills, competencies and relationships to set us up and to move fast and quickly into the marketplace
Umer, this is Tony
I think a lack of inflection would be a terrible tragedy for those patients who suffer from this disease and who will either be suffering an early untimely heart attack or stroke
The price we came to market with was clearly aligned with an understanding about the rebate that would be required in the marketplace to gain a competitive position
When you look at the data we presented at the ACC in March this year, we clearly talked about the pharmaco-economic value of this product, how PCSK9 within the class, and reconfirmed that our net price to payers is presently very much in the range of a pharmaco-economic price
We continue to believe that this drug brings value
When you look at the second year data, that you're reducing heart attacks by 35%, reducing stroke by 24%, 27%
It's an enormous crack in this disease that takes lives on a untimely basis
So we will continue to drive it forward, and to ensure that the value we bring is distinct and beneficial in the marketplace
Ronny, it's Tony
I don't have those exact numbers with me
We can get back to you, but obviously a lot of our oncology business is in the institution which falls under 340B and we watch that versus carefully
It has grown quite dramatically in the last three, four years or so, but I think it's sort of under 20% of our total business would be 340B
So, Jim, the value-based process is defining the value of a product based on the threshold you set for a quality of life you saved
It's a process used by most health technology assessment companies around the world, such as the UK, Canada and Australia
It's an evolution of a process in the U.S
at the moment and we feel quite robust and confident in our ability to establish that type of range of value for a product
We discuss that with the payers on an ongoing basis
I think what you might be referring to is a bit of our risk-share contract we've actually put into place
And those are interesting ones too, where we have product deliver a distinctive value and we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is with those particular products
Some payers have taken us up, such as Harvard Pilgrim
Others are trying to work at how do they track that, monitor that as they go forward
But I would imagine going forward, it has to be something that becomes more and more popular
If you turn to page 23 of your slide deck, that's of course a chart that I look at often, which shows a distinctive movement of our market share since the outcomes data was delivered at the ACC in March
Clearly people understanding the value of this drug in terms of long-term treatment
So we have in the interim also worked hard as I said earlier to try and reduce the impact on patients who have large commercial co-pays or large commercial deductions
And we're working consistently with payers to try and make the utilization management criteria as well as the process to get access to drug more reasonable to ensure appropriate patients get access
You guys can see the size of the multiple myeloma market based on the patient numbers themselves
So there's a distinctive population that exists over there
It's a population that presently isn't in our label and therefore we have not been able to promote on that particular patient group
And we look forward to doing it early in or whenever we get in a label in 2018.
