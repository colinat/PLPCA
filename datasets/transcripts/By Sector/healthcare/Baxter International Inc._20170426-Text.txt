Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today
I will get started by sharing some comments on our first quarter performance, then I will turn it over to Jay who will walk through the rest of the P&L and provide an update on our guidance for the year
After that, we'll close with Q&A
We opened 2017 with a strong quarter, reflecting continued progress across our three strategic vectors of portfolio management and innovation, operational excellence, and capital allocation
On the top line, Baxter delivered sales growth of 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis
Operationally, Baxter's sales rose 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for the U.S
cyclophosphamide market, and the previously communicated selected strategic product exits the company is undertaking
The results were driven by strength across our U.S
businesses as well as growth in peritoneal dialysis, acute renal therapies and nutrition (03:27) globally
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.58 per diluted share
This reflects solid execution on the top line as well as the sustained momentum of our business transformation efforts
Now, I will walk you through performance by business, and I will be speaking to growth figures on an operational basis to provide a clear understanding of underlying performance
Global sales for Hospital Products were $1.6 billion, advancing 10% operationally
Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $585 million, up 13% operationally
Performance was driven by IV solutions strength in the U.S
along with increased sales of IV access sets, reflecting the ongoing pull-through from our growing SPECTRUM pump installed base
Moving to Integrated Pharma Solutions or IPS
Global sales were $552 million, increasing 4% operationally
Contributing to performance in the quarter was increased demand for the company's nutritional therapies globally in four (04:43) premixed injectable drugs enhanced (04:47) drug reconstitution systems in the U.S
We are continuing to bolster growth in the IPS business through both organic and inorganic opportunities, particularly in the generic injectable pharmaceuticals
We remain on track to close our acquisition of Claris Injectables in the second half of 2017, which will greatly expand our marketed portfolio and pipeline
And in the first quarter, we announced a new strategic agreement with ScinoPharm, one of the world's leading API manufacturers to help develop, manufacture and commercialize five injectable drugs used in a range of cancer treatments with an option to partner on an additional 15 molecules
In addition, we are preparing to launch several proprietary premixed injectable molecules in 2017 through our internal research and development pipeline
As we have stated previously, we plan to continue expanding our presence in the generic injectable space
Moving to Surgical Care, which includes anesthesia and biosurgery, total sales were $334 million, increasing 11% operationally
Performance in the quarter was fueled by strong U.S
growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven primarily by increased demand for Transderm Scop due to a temporary supply disruption in an alternate product during the quarter
Increased sales of Brevibloc, a fast-acting IV beta blocker, also contributed to the growth in the quarter
The biosurgery business advanced mid-single digits on a global basis driven by double-digit growth internationally of our core hemostat sealant (06:32)
As we have previously mentioned, we have increased our investment in this business in an effort to turn around performance
We expect to begin recognizing the benefit of these actions towards the latter part of this year and beyond
Some recent highlights include the acquisition of Wound Care Technologies Incorporated, the manufacturer of the DERMACLOSE Continuous Tissue Expander
DERMACLOSE is a highly innovative device used to facilitate the suturing and stapling of the skin around moderate to large wounds and represents our entry into a complementary product category
We are also focused on enhancing growth organically
Early this month, we unveiled customer-centric enhancements to both our FLOSEAL and TISSEEL hemostatic agents
They are designed to improve safety for patients and ease of use for clinicians
And in March, we announced the publication of two compelling analyses in the Journal of Medical Economics supporting FLOSEAL as a cost-effective hemostat that may contribute to broader cost savings at hospitals as compared to other options
Finally, in the Hospital Products sales in our Other category, we were $108 million, up 18%
Growth in the quarter benefited from continued demand for our contract manufacturing services, including our expert thesis (08:05) cytotoxic manufacturing at our Jülich, Germany facility
During the first half of 2017, we expect higher growth for this business as we continue to anniversary the impact from one of our customers bringing manufacturing in-house
Turning to our Renal business, sales were $896 million in the first quarter, up 2% operationally
Globally, peritoneal dialysis achieved mid-single digit operational growth, reflecting an increasing patient base and ongoing market momentum of our new Automated Peritoneal Dialysis or APD cyclers, AMIA in the U.S
and HOMECHOICE CLARIA for international markets
The success of AMIA and HOMECHOICE CLARIA APD is due in large part to our proprietary shares towards (08:54) telemedicine technology, which recently surpassed 0.5 million patient treatments
In a related development, Baxter also received approval in the quarter for a new KAGUYA APD system in Japan, which we expect to launch later this year
Japan is a market in which we are looking to broaden our presence across the portfolio
Renal growth in the quarter was impacted by a mid-single digit decline in in-center hemodialysis globally
Positive performance in our U.S
in-center agency business was offset by lower sales internationally due to continued competitive pressures on dialysis
We continue to focus on enhancing the profitability of this business while also stabilizing the growth profile
The acute renal business delivered solid mid-single digit growth globally in the quarter
As we have previously mentioned, we believe the acute market holds substantial opportunity for us, and we are pleased to report that our next-generation leading-edge PRISMAX acute care technology now has been deployed for patients' use in several European locations as part of an initial limited distribution
Clinician and patient response to-date has been favorable, and we look forward to the full European commercial launch in 2018. In summary, our companywide results for the quarter reflect our focus on disciplined execution to drive improved operational performance
Certainly, our business transformation efforts have been central to margin expansion and we are by no means finished
We are pursuing several new fronts to accelerate these efforts, which we expect will generate incremental savings going forward, a portion of which we intend to redeploy back into the businesses to drive innovation and growth
The most important point to stress in closing is that we are on a continuing journey, and our results this quarter reinforce our confidence that we are on the right path to achieve our goal of sustained top quartile performance
With that, I will turn it over to Jay
Matt, the performance of our Renal business in the PD, peritoneal dialysis, and acute renal care is doing very well
And because we are market leaders in both of them, our growth for the vast majority dictates the growth of the market
We have added a good number of patients for the PD business
And AMIA has been a tremendous success in the U.S
As a matter of fact, the growth is at or above what we have said before in terms of market
The issue that we have is simply in-center HD and is focused in Europe for the vast majority
We have had a decent amount (22:38) of competition – price competition actually in Europe on the dialyzer, and we have plans to come back at that with growth opportunities in Asia to offset that
And our issue in Renal is primarily Europe in-center HD, and we are attentively looking at that
Just a note on the general business of Baxter, for Europe, we have made significant changes in management and as well as country management
We are revamping that organization and looking forward to the new folks to make an impact
So, that's the area of focus that we have right now
But in terms of the Renal business, not only we are very happy with the PD business and acute renal care
Matter of fact, the acute renal care, we are taking market share in the U.S
We continue to convert at a large rate hospitals in the U.S
, and the profitability, most importantly, has increased significantly in the renal business
So, we're quite happy with that
So, the focus, as I said, is in fixing Europe in-center HD
Vijay, good morning
My perspective has not changed about where Baxter stands
We're open to the tuck-ins, and we're doing them, and we're working very hard to get even more opportunities
We have a good pipeline in our pharmaceutical business between partnership and some tuck-ins and even in our advanced surgery, our biosurgery business
With the performance of the company and the work that Jay and Cathy Skala have done in our business transformation process and how quick we are integrating and simplifying our back office, I feel more confident that Baxter could do a 20%, 25% of our market cap deal without a problem, okay? It doesn't mean that we're going to do it, but my confidence has increased in the management of the company in really pulling off something that would be a good deal for our shareholders in terms of bringing synergies to the bottom line and a good accretion to the top line
Mike, you have a good memory, and I'm happy you listen to what I say
We do have more confidence in Baxter
First of all, as a new CEO last year, you're just getting to know the company
You're getting to know the management and its capabilities
No, we have a solid team, a very, very good team, and the execution has been great
So, that gives me confidence that we can do something bigger if the opportunity arises and things are in the right place, and there is value for our shareholders and never compromising what we think is our primary reason in doing deals, which is deliver more value to our shareholders
So, basically, our confidence goes up, the percentage goes up, and I think it's really reasonable to assume that if there's an opportunity, Baxter has the balance sheet, has the borrowing capability, and we feel comfortable with it
David, I would say that all of the efforts that were put into innovation and the better deployment of R&D dollars and portfolio management are all starting to give us more comfort that our top line growth can be augmented organically towards the end of 2017 into 2018. Those are not overnight programs
Those are programs that take a significant amount of time if you know our products
Even our hemostats, those are long-term studies that need to be done
But as what I have seen so far coming out our R&D reviews and portfolio business reviews that we're going to start getting momentum towards the end of this year, beginning next year with the things that we started since we started as CEO
I would say that there are some very notable upticks in areas like PD with AMIA and HOMECHOICE CLARIA
We are seeing the launch of some technologies across the board that were not before emphasized by the company such as our extra portfolio (35:48) technologies as well as acute renal care new technology we match (35:51)
So, I would tell our investors that there's a significant focus in innovation, but innovation is the part that takes a little longer, and we see that hitting most in 2018. Our story is one of providing value to the shareholder
We went very hard at our cost structure as well as our efficiency selling products in the market, and you can see that
The Claris acquisition will bring some really good molecules, between 150 to 175. I gave the team led by Robert Felicelli a specific goal that by 2021, we need to have more than 300 molecules in the marketplace as well as understanding and potential pipeline of biosimilars
So, we are just in the beginning of our journey to develop a really strong top line organic growth company
And in the meantime, to deliver value to our shareholders, we're hitting everything that we can in terms of making this company the most efficient and effective in everything we do
Hi, Larry
The Renal pipeline is one of the richest that we have right now
And we reorganized our company that put squarely under the general managers and presidents of the businesses, the research and development management with people that we brought from other companies to Baxter
It has enhanced significantly our ability to not only develop, put products in the market but also accelerate the clinical studies that we're doing
So, I'll give an example
We're very excited about THERANOVA
We're going to be investing in the next few years $25 million in clinical data because we are convinced and have sufficient data in hand right now that proves this product is superior to any dialyzer in the market today
When it comes to acute renal care, we have great products for the sepsis treatment
We're going to continue to double down (41:56) in places like Japan and bring that technology on a global basis
And then let me talk about the point of care
A lot has been said by a bunch of different people about point of care and PD and all of this stuff
And Baxter is probably the only company that has the capability to vertically integrate all of these technologies
And to that end, we will be putting our first patient on point of care treatment towards the end of 2018. So, we have a very strong belief, and our pathway is now determined that we can do that
So, that is a great achievement to the chronic renal team that has put that together
So, as I say to the folks at Baxter, go compete for the dollars, go show the best ROIC, and Renal has done a great job so far
I hope the other divisions will follow through, go fight for that dollar that we have available for product development and clinicals
Clinical trial
Will be first – a little – I would say fourth quarter of 2018 we'll have a (43:16) first patient clinical trial
And from that point on, we're going to roll it out as soon as we can in terms of getting the population defined by the agencies in terms of clinical trial
And the launch, we'll be looking at probably towards the end of 2019.
Larry, this is a very dynamic marketplace
There's a lot of things happening
We have a relentless focus in inorganic opportunities
But inorganic opportunities is now what will drive our company solely
So, we do a very good balance between how much time we spend in looking new opportunities, how much time we spend managing Baxter's current businesses and making sure that all the businesses are performing well
We are every month looking at least 10, 12 opportunities
Some fall off for financial reasons
Some of them have changed in dynamics and performance and situation
With the expansion of our reach in terms of size, it brings a bit more opportunity to the table in terms of evaluating
This doesn't mean that we're going to do the deal, but this means that we're going to evaluate
And one thing Baxter is starting to do very well, we're very fast at evaluating the deal coming to the table, have enhanced significantly our internal capabilities, which are under Andy Kidd who runs the strategy for us and BD&L (45:12) and David Roman who is in strategy as well here
So, these teams have been put together, a significant amount of horsepower
So, we are doing everything we can, but the first thing is if it strategically makes sense, it needs to make sense for our shareholders
The money, when we look at this, this is not our money
We're just here taking care of the money for our shareholders
Welcome
Hi, Bob
We have four areas that we consider core growth in our portfolio
It doesn't mean that we don't pay attention neither invest in those other areas
We do and we pay a lot of attention to those
But Renal is about new therapies and end-to-end care of our patients
Then we have critical care, which is an augmentation of what we already have between acute renal care as well as our IPS, our fluid management business
Then we have the Baxter Pharmaceutical business, which is to go into generics and eventually into biosimilars, okay, all injectables, cytotoxic molecules, oncolytics, so that's in Baxter Pharmaceutical
And then you have advanced surgery, which is to complement our product
So, the way we think about this, by defining broader categories within Baxter, allows us to look at spaces that is less singularly focused on product but more focused in areas of care
So, in process of looking at this, we really stumble at opportunities and encounter opportunities that has a little bit of white space in them
At the moment, we are looking at augmentation to support areas of growth for us, not specifically and exclusively in white spaces
We're not there yet
We have our venture capital group here at Baxter where we look at opportunities in white space, but those are at the venture capital level
So, this should give you a bit more color on how we think about deals
The second in wound management specifically is a natural adjacency of our biosurgery business, which is an adjunct, that knowledge in the OR, are opportunities such as this one we just acquired
It's a small business but goes nicely into our wraps bags (50:08)
The wound management per se in terms of traditional wound management, specifically is not an area of interest
As I said, we may come across a company that we like overall products but has that as a small business
It's a different conversation
But to have us specifically targeting wound management is not something that is in the cards at the moment in time
This has to do with wound closure, which is very adjacent to our hemostat and sealing business
Thank you
Danielle, if you look at our long-term objective is to be at mid-single digit growth rate, okay? And the only way to get there in the markets that we are today is to go into a business like the generic injectables, which will change the weighted average market growth rate of our company
So, I would say that Claris will have an impact likely in 2018, and then when you go in 2019 and 2020, they will bring probably 50 to 100 basis points of incremental growth to the company because it's not Claris itself, but it's everything else that will be attached to Claris
Claris has great manufacturing capabilities
In our integration plans, we are already starting to expand a couple of their buildings to put more capability like dual chamber bags and other things there
And so, we are looking at that as a platform
So, I would say that with comfort that 50 to 100 basis points in the midterm growth rate is acceptable
We're looking at Brik Eyre and Robert Felicelli (53:55) to really deliver on those numbers and also to augment our molecule pipeline
Matt, you have to think about what are the major prerequisites for something to get into the funnel
And one of them is be within those four pillars I mentioned before
The second thing is to make sure there is category of leadership in the products that people make and sell
Then once you pass through those broad lenses, it's about what can Baxter do to be a better owner for that business
And if you look at our contract capability in the U.S
, (55:45) growth in the U.S
, this is phenomenal job (55:47) doing this
So, that is a positive
Baxter is a hospital company, and we are a supply company
We are in every hospital in this country
So, we should have the ability to bring synergy (56:01) in terms of distribution as well as how we manage sales and marketing within the regions of the world because we are effective and very efficient in doing it
Above and beyond that, the scale of products and the ability to synergize by channel, you have the whole efficiency of cost to maintain the infrastructure, the pure G&A, which I think now we are in a position to really bring a lot of synergies to the table that about a year-and-a-half ago, we were not
So, that gives me confidence that once and if we find the right opportunity for Baxter and our shareholders, we will have the channel synergy as well as the cost synergy
Now, remember, we always have this conversation about improving our weighted average market growth rate, and that's the only and sole focus of going into businesses on an inorganic manner and to get businesses that have markets that they serve that will be complementary to ours and the growth will be accretive to us
So, once we get those things on the table, we can make our decisions more clearly
Sure
We'll forgive you for flipping calls back and forth like that (58:12)
So, this is a platform for Baxter
Baxter had this product line for decades in several different shapes and form
We are here to stay
We have this SPECTRUM platform today in the U.S
and Canada, which is doing very, very well
Most importantly is not only the pumps but also the ability to place the sets
And the sets are what continues to deliver on profitability and revenue growth
We have a couple more generations of our SPECTRUM pump coming up in the next couple of years, and then we're going to launch a new global platform that includes different types of pumps that were currently in development
We're outside the U.S
We have a partnership with a foreign manufacturer where we're going to be augmenting our product lines in Anglo-Saxon speaking countries, so we have the ability to replace our old platform called COLLEAGUE, which is still being sold outside the U.S
in a few countries with a much more modern
But the beauty about our platform on a global basis is our drug library is second to none
And having that being retrofitted in any platform, including the one that we are developing with a foreign partner at the moment, is really important
So, our teams are working very hard
We have augmented our research and development teams across the globe
We have strong center in the U.S
We have centers now in India
We augmented not only with third-party design houses but also our own people in our R&D centers in India
So, we are ramping up to really make this business a leading business in the industry that it competes
Glenn, I don't think there was any pull forward
I think our cycle of sales and growth that Jay had explained here, it had to do a lot with the placements of products that we had early this year and also in the last year-and-a-half
So, we see the U.S
supply business as steady, as low single-digit growth, but it is growing
And we don't see at the moment anything that would create major disruption to the system
Clearly, healthcare reform is up there
And now, they were looking at tax reform and how things are coming along, but I think in businesses like ours where the significant infrastructure products that are used for day-to-day operation of a hospital or a care center or patient care like our PD business, we see that the market in the U.S
is still a good market
The increase of growth is about 2%, 3%
So, we find no disruption in the near term or foreseeable future to that market
Glenn, once you take out the businesses that we exited, which are all in emerging markets, so we are talking about India, you're talking about Venezuela, you're talking about Turkey
Our growth was 6%, and emerging markets is 20% to 22% of our overall sales
You have an impressive growth in Latin America ex Venezuela of 10%
We had good growth in China, 5%
Remember, we are not in physician-preferred medical devices in China
We are local manufacturer of fluids in China for PD and so specialty fluids or IV as well as nutrition
So, 5% is a good growth in China for those products
Emerging Asia, 5%, and East EMEA (01:03:45), which is all the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa is about 4%
So, I'm quite happy with that
We had to exit those businesses because the profitability profile of them were way below what we had set as acceptable for our company
But ex those businesses, we are pretty good there
The issues that we have in international, some parts of Europe which are underperforming, as I said, we're taking measures to replace management but also to extend product line offerings and clinical trials to get new products in the market there
Thank you, Glenn
