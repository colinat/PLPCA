0,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone"
1,"As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results, reinforcing our confidence that we are on the right path to achieve our goal of sustaining top quartile performance"
2,"Sales in the quarter increased 1% on a reported basis, 2% constant currency and 3% operationally, in line with our expectations"
3,The results were really driven by strength across many of our U.S
4,businesses and improving operational growth internationally
5,"On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.63 per diluted share"
6,"This exceeded our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share and reflects solid execution on the top-line, the ongoing impacts from our business transformation efforts and a modest benefit from other income and a lower tax rate"
7,Now I will walk you through performance by business
8,I will be speaking to growth figures on an operational basis to provide a clearer understanding of underlying performance
9,"As a reminder, our operational basis presentation excludes the impact of foreign exchange, U.S"
10,"cyclophosphamide, and selected strategic product exits"
11,"Global sales for Hospital Products were $1.6 billion, advancing 4% operationally"
12,"Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $607 million, up 6% operationally"
13,Performance was primarily driven by strong sales of IV solutions in the U.S
14,"Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS, global sales were $568 million, increasing 4% operationally"
15,Contributing to performance in the quarter was increased demand for the company's nutritional therapies in the U.S
16,", driven by a temporary market disruption for select nutritional products"
17,"Sales for premixed injectable drugs also increased in the quarter, driven by recent launches and incremental pull-through of other premixed injectable products in our portfolio"
18,"Moving to Surgical Care, which includes anesthesia and biosurgery, total sales were $352 million, increasing 3% operationally"
19,Performance in the quarter was fueled by strong U.S
20,"growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by increased sales of Brevibloc, a fast-acting IV beta blocker, and Transderm Scop"
21,We did experience a slight benefit in the quarter as the alternate supplier for Transderm Scop returned to the market a bit later than expected
22,"Globally, biosurgery sales slightly declined during the quarter"
23,"Mid-single digit growth of core hemostats and sealants was more than offset by the impact from lower sales of non-core products, such as PERI-STRIPS and ACTIFUSE"
24,"Finally, in Hospital Products, sales in our other category were $110 million, declining 10%"
25,"Growth in the quarter was impacted by lower demand for our contract manufacturing services in our Bloomington, Indiana, facility and lower manufacturing service revenues from Shire"
26,"Turning to Renal business, sales were $968 million, up 3% operationally"
27,Sales in the quarter benefited from solid sales of peritoneal dialysis and acute renal care products
28,"The in-center hemodialysis business advanced low single digits globally, driven by strong sales in the U.S"
29,", partially offset by lower sales internationally"
30,"The Acute business delivered mid single-digit growth globally in the quarter, driven by increased sales internationally"
31,slowed in the quarter given a difficult year-over-year comparison as sales in Q2 2016 benefited from a temporary market disruption for continuous renal replacement solutions
32,We expect growth in this business to return to double digits in the back half of the year
33,"Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 45.2% represents an improvement of 140 basis points over the prior year, driven by improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio, favorable manufacturing performance and a benefit from our business transformation efforts aimed at simplifying the portfolio to drive efficiency and reduce cost"
34,"Adjusted SG&A totaled $603 million, decreasing 9% on a reported basis"
35,The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on effectively managing our expense base to eliminate costs and reduce inefficiencies
36,"Transition service agreement totaled â€“ income totaled approximately $16 million in the quarter, a reduction of approximately $10 million compared to the second quarter of 2016."
37,We expect transition service incomes to total approximately $20 million in the second half of 2017.
38,Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $155 million increased 3% versus the prior year
39,This reflects our stated intention to increase investments in R&D to drive innovation and augment top-line growth
40,"Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.1%, an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year"
41,"Operating margin compared favorably to our expectations, driven by improved gross margin and disciplined expense management"
42,"Net interest expense was $13 million in the quarter, as was adjusted other income, which totaled $13 million in the quarter"
43,This reflected a benefit from foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions
44,"The adjusted tax rate was 16.9% for the quarter, which reflects the benefit from the new stock compensation guidance, along with select discrete items"
45,"And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.63 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share, driven by operational strength, other income benefit and a lower tax expense"
46,"During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $45 million or approximately 750,000 shares"
47,These targeted repurchases were more than offset by option-related dilution
48,"Before turning to our updated outlook, I will provide some commentary regarding our cash flow performance"
49,"On a year-to-date basis, we've generated free cash flow of $488 million, an improvement of more than $400 million versus the prior year, driven by strong operational performance and lower capital expenditures, along with continued focus on improving the company's working capital performance"
50,"Of particular note, we ended the quarter with DSO of 53 days and days payable of 52 days"
51,Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2017 and 2020.
52,"Starting with 2017, we expect full-year sales to increase approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis"
53,"cyclophosphamide impact, select strategic product exits and removing the benefit from the proposed Claris acquisition, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%"
54,All three of these sales ranges represent an increase from our prior guidance
55,"This growth reflects approximately $55 million in incremental sales from the Claris acquisition, which, as Joe said, we expect to close imminently"
56,"We now expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and 5% to 6% operationally"
57,"Within Hospital Products, we now expect Fluid Systems constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6% and 7% to 8% on an operational basis"
58,"For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions business, we expect constant currency sales growth of 4% to 5%"
59,We expect full-year sales for cyclophosphamide of approximately $160 million as compared to our previous guidance of $135 million
60,Our updated assumption is that additional competitors will enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2017.
61,"And as I just mentioned, we anticipate that Claris will add approximately $55 million of revenues to IPS"
62,"Operationally, IPS sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%"
63,Within Surgical Care we now anticipate sales to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% operationally
64,"And finally, for the Hospital Products business we now expect DPS and other to increase low single-digits"
65,"For the Renal business, we expect full year constant currency sales to increase approximately 3% and growth of approximately 4% operationally"
66,"Moving down the P&L, we now expect an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.5% to 16%"
67,We expect net interest expense to total approximately $60 million and other income of approximately $20 million for 2017.
68,"For the year, we now expect an average adjusted cash rate of approximately 19.5%"
69,For full year 2017 we anticipated diluted average share count of approximately 555 million shares
70,"Based on these factors, we now expect 2017 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.34 to $2.40 per diluted share"
71,"Finally, for the year, we are increasing our outlook and now expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion"
72,"Specific to the third quarter 2017, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 4% on a reported basis and increase approximately 5% on a constant currency basis"
73,"Operationally, sales in the third quarter are expected to increase approximately 6%"
74,Claris is expected to contribute approximately $20 million in sales to the third quarter
75,"And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.58 to $0.60 per diluted share"
76,"Before opening up the call to Q&A, I'd like to expand a bit on our updated longer-term financial outlook"
77,"Since we provided our updated projections last May, we have been very focused on opportunities for improvement"
78,Our solid operational performance to date has positioned us well for continued success
79,"As Joe stated, we expect sales growth of 4% compounded annually"
80,"While our sales outlook has not changed, I do want to point out a couple of factors"
81,Top-line performance in 2016 came in better than we had projected in May 2016.
82,And the guidance provided last year did not incorporate the select strategic exits we undertook this year
83,These two factors offset the expected benefit from the Claris acquisition
84,"In addition, as we approach 2020 we expect sales growth to be north of 4% on annual basis as we benefit from the actions we've taken to optimize the portfolio and drive increased productivity from our pipeline investments"
85,The adjusted operating margin of 20% compares favorably to previous guidance of 17% to 18% and reflect continued momentum from our business transformation efforts as well as improve manufacturing performance
86,"In 2020, we expect adjusted EPS of $3.25 to $3.40 per share, representing a mid-teen increase from the prior guidance of $2.75 to $3 dollars per share"
87,Our EPS outlook does not assume any meaningful share repurchases
88,"We've only modeled repurchases to offset dilution, holding our share count flat to 2017 levels"
89,"In addition, we've not included any additional meaningful business development initiatives beyond the Claris acquisition in these projections"
90,"For me, one of the most important numbers Joe mentioned earlier is our increased cash flow outlook"
91,We expect to generate more than $2.6 billion in operating cash flow by 2020.
92,"We will further reduce CapEx spending which is expected to be less than 6% of sales by 2020, resulting in free cash flow improving approximately $250 million to approximately $2 billion in 2020."
93,"And to rephrase my earlier comment, this is an unlevered view of our business"
94,It does not reflect any meaningful deployment of the balance sheet other than the repurchase of shares to offset dilution
95,"Similar to our previous guidance, this plan was built from the bottoms up"
96,"We're pleased with this update but as always, we'll look for ways to enhance this performance"
97,"And 2020 by no means represents the peak, or rather just another step in our journey"
98,"We expect to host an Investor Day during the second quarter of 2018 where we will provide a review of our business strategies, product pipeline, innovation, along with a more extended financial outlook"
99,"With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A"
100,Question-and-Answer Session
101,"Vijay, thanks for the question"
102,So just commenting on your second question first with respect to gross margin performance over the LRP
103,"In last year's iteration of our financial projections, we shared an operating margin of roughly 17% to 18%, we've increased that to 20% in our current look at 2020."
104,"But to decompose the 17% to 18%, we were really in the range of 44% to 45% on a gross margin standpoint"
105,R&D was roughly 5% and then SG&A was 22%
106,"As we moved to this year's LRP, there are a number of areas of improvement"
107,One of the biggest relates to gross margin where we now expect roughly a 46% gross margin in 2020.
108,There are a number of contributing factors to this
109,I said in the past I've been very pleased with the manufacturing performance under the leadership of Scott Pleau
110,That team has been incredibly focused on driving cost savings and improvements in the manufacturing network
111,So we expect to see some of that
112,But on the gross margin line we'll also benefit from mix as we move forward as we did exit some lower margin sales and then furthermore as we look at the inclusion of Claris in our projections
113,"To complete the picture, R&D is basically unchanged versus the prior iteration and SG&A improves another hundred basis points, again, driven by continued and relentless focus on cost"
114,So that's really the picture from a margin standpoint
115,"As it relates to sales projections, yes, I think it's safe to say we've been very pleased with the sales performance of our business, right?"
116,"And as we look at the LRP, really the biggest changes for us are a couple of fold"
117,"One, we've included Claris"
118,so the IPS business now will grow faster than we previously expected
119,but then we did exit certain strategic lower margin sales areas
120,And so we do have an impact on Fluid Systems and on the Renal business
121,Those business growths are down a little bit from the prior version of the LRP
122,"So as we sit here today, obviously we're looking to accelerate wherever possible"
123,"And in fact, Joe's comments and my comments around innovation, as we look over long-term, we're looking to accelerate the pace of innovation and pull-forward where possible"
124,"But as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with the 4%"
125,We would normally expect to see an uptick in the second half EPS just based on natural business trends
126,And that's something that we've seen over the last several years
127,There are several factors that we have to be mindful of
128,"First of all, transition service income"
129,"We expect Shire to wind down their need for our services, and right now that's a $0.03 headwind first-half to second-half"
130,"Secondly, we did from a cyclo-performance standpoint, we have roughly $0.04 of deterioration, $0.03 to $0.04 of deterioration first-half to second-half"
131,"Third, we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments, I think these are very strategic and important"
132,"And as we get to your first question in relation to how do we accelerate sales growth, it's very much about pulling forward timelines as much as possible, something our team is really focused on"
133,R&D tics up roughly $0.03 in the second half of the year
134,"And then finally, the way the tax rate works with the benefits related to FASB 123(NYSE:R), typically those benefits are concentrated in the first half of the year, and so we do see the tax rate ticking up $0.03 to $0.04."
135,"And finally, we have other income and interest which is $0.01 â€"
136,“ or there's a $0.01 impact in the second half of the year
137,"So as we look at the first half to the second half, there are roughly $0.14 to $0.15 of headwinds as we analyzed it, that we fight through to give the guidance that we've shared with you today"
138,"From a Claris standpoint, we expect roughly $0.05 of accretion in 2020, a little bit north of that"
139,"And then from a dividend payout ratio, our expectation is to maintain over the long term this targeted payout ratio of 35% of adjusted net income"
140,"As you know, we are not doing today-"
141,"Larry, thanks for the question"
142,"Overall, from a margin standpoint, the first comment I would make is we do not believe that 20% is the peak"
143,"In fact, as we share our guidance in May of next year we'll extend beyond 2020."
144,"And you heard Joe make some earlier comments about a business' life, our injectables business, there's incredible excitements around that in part because of the higher margin those businesses carry than the Baxter corporate average"
145,"So as we move from 2020 to beyond, we start to get lift from mix and innovation really, really accelerating and helping the margin improvement"
146,"In terms of how we develop the target as a conservative or not, it's the same methodology that we've used over the last three years for developing our long-range financial planning commitments"
147,"Specifically, we have programs earmarked from a bottoms-up standpoint that sum total to 20%"
148,"In the past, I've talked with investors about outside-in and comparing to competitors and using that as a basis"
149,"But for us, we've never done that"
150,We've always done bottoms up initiative by initiative
151,"And so we know exactly how we're going to get from where we are today, 15.5% to 16%, to the 2020 target of 20%"
152,"And, in fact, as we leave this call, Joe and I will be going to a zero-based budgeting meeting where we will be reviewing many of the savings initiatives that support this 2020 objective"
153,"As far as the linearity of this, I don't want to get into guidance discussions for 2018 at this point"
154,"What I will tell you is, it is now like there's 300 basis points of improvement in a particular year"
155,It is fairly balanced
156,"But again, I'll stop short of giving annual targets for margin improvement"
157,Thank you
158,"One important point relates to Claris, and so as we think about the growth rate for the third quarter, there is some benefit from Claris, roughly $15 million in the third quarter"
159,"$20 million, sorry"
160,"$20 million in the third quarter,"
161,so that's one item
162,"As far as other areas, there is some acceleration outside the U.S"
163,and part of the business outside the U.S
164,relates to tenders
165,"So as we look at some of our regions, our EMEA region, our Asia-Pacific region, we do see a sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 based on the timing of tenders, which is a little bit different than we've seen in prior quarters and years"
166,So really that is one of the factors that drives this acceleration into the third quarter
167,"And then, of course, we had a solid Q4 last year"
168,So that factors into our math
169,"Again, we also have cyclo which tails off a little bit in the fourth quarter, so that's a factor as we look at pure constant currency growth"
170,So that's another element to consider
171,"I think as we look at the second-half growth, we feel confident in our ability to achieve it"
172,There are some nuances between Q3 and Q4 related to timing of tenders' performance in Q4 cyclo
173,"But on balance, I think it's consistent with what we've expected"
174,"And like I said, we feel confident in our ability to deliver it"
175,"David, the EBITDA margin in 2020 is approximately 26%"
176,"In our modeling, we've held share counts flat to 2017 levels"
177,And underlying that is an assumption about a certain amount of buyback
178,"But the result of that, given the very strong cash flow generation of the company, is a serious positive net debt or net asset position as we look at cash relative to growth stat"
179,"Thanks, Isaac"
180,"Yes, again, for us, the relevant number is the 4% over the period"
181,"As we approach the back part of this long-range plan horizon, you start to see the impact of innovation and annual rates ticking the 2020 rate is a little bit above the 4%"
182,"And then as we look at 2018, there are a few different factors in play that impact that"
183,You have the full â€
184,“ a annualization or some â€
185,"“ a part of your benefit from Claris, but you also have an assumption around cyclo competition that we will be taking"
186,And then also the impact of innovation in 2018 is not as great as it is in the latter part of this plan period
187,So a number of different factors
188,"We'll stop short again today of giving annual revenue guidance because, again, there's a lot of puts and takes as we approach 2018."
189,"By 2020, we have a fairly small cyclo business, so we expect this winding down very significantly from the current level to a 2020 number, and that occurs â€"
190,“ starts to occur at the end of 2018 â€“ or 2017 as a result of incremental competition on-boarding
191,But I will tell you this is one that we have frankly been surprised by over the last several years
192,"The level â€“ the number of competitive entrants has been fewer than we originally modeled in 2015, than we modeled again in 2016."
193,So it's best for us to keep watching this one
194,"We'll provide an update on cyclo guidance on our January earnings call certainly, and again as we approach the balance of this year in next quarter's call"
195,But it's hard to say what's ultimately going to happen
196,What I can tell you is we have a fair amount of competition that's assumed by 2020 with a fairly de minimis business left in cyclo at that point
197,"The prior guidance, the midpoint of the range was roughly $2.24, and as we think about the current midpoint, it moves to $2.37."
198,There's a few drivers
199,The over-performance that we experienced in Q2 contributes roughly $0.07.
200,"The tax rate, improvements in tax is roughly $0.03."
201,Cyclophosphamide is a couple of pennies of impact
202,FX is $0.01 and Claris is $0.01.
203,"So if you add those up, it's roughly $0.14 versus the midpoint of the last guidance range"
204,About half of that speaks to the Q2 performance with the residual relating to other aspects of the business
