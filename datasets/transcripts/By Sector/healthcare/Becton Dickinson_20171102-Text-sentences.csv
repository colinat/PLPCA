95,Safety revenues grew 16% in emerging markets in the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full fiscal year
96,Slide 13 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results
97,"As discussed, revenues grew 4.4% in the quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes approximately 100 basis points negative impact from the U.S"
98,dispensing change
99,"As we move down the P&L, I would like to point out that, similar to our prior quarters, our results in the prior year period include the Respiratory Solutions business while the current period does not, as the business was divested in October 2016."
100,"Starting with gross profit, the decline of 50 basis points year-over-year includes approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from the loss of gross profit related to Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S"
101,dispensing change
102,I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment
103,SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 24.4%
104,"In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional selling and shipping costs related to our efforts to scale shipments in the month of September, as previously discussed"
105,"As a result for the full year, SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was slightly above our guidance range"
106,Accounting for the impact from the Respiratory divestiture and the U.S
107,"dispensing change, we are pleased with the leverage we have achieved on an underlying basis, with SSG&A dollars growing slower than revenues"
108,R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7%
109,The decline in R&D dollars spent year-over-year is due to the divestiture of the Respiratory Solutions business as well as the comparison to the prior year where we increased R&D spend in the fourth quarter as a result of the medical device tax suspension
110,"Our tax rate declined to 14.6% in the quarter, resulting in a full year effective tax rate below our guidance range of 15.2%"
111,"As you are aware, we expected a lower tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as an offset to the impact of U.S"
112,dispensing change
113,"Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, as you will see when I take you through our adjusted EPS guidance, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate"
114,This is largely the result of discrete items in fiscal 2017 that are not expected to recur
115,"In the quarter, operating income grew 6.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 13.2% compared to the prior year"
116,Both operating income and EPS include approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S
117,dispensing change
118,"Turning to slide 14 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter, as you can see, currency did not have an impact on gross profit margin or operating margin in the quarter"
119,"On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 100 basis points as continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix which includes the positive impact of divestitures were partially offset by slight headwinds from pension and raw materials"
120,"As expected, operating margin improved significantly in the fourth quarter, increasing 180 basis points"
121,This was largely driven by the comparison to the high level of R&D spend in the prior year
122,"For the full year, we are extremely pleased to have delivered approximately 180 basis points of underlying margin expansion"
123,"As Vince said earlier, over a three-year period we achieved approximately 500 basis points of margin expansion"
124,"Moving to slide 15, I'd like to highlight our EPS growth which was in line with our expectations for the total year"
125,"Starting with fiscal 2016 EPS of $8.59, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver currency neutral EPS growth of 13.2% while overcoming notable headwinds"
126,"The strength of our performance as well as the tax benefit from stock comp accounting and other discrete items drove our ability to offset significant headwinds from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture, the U.S"
127,"dispensing change, pension and unfavorable currency"
128,"All in, we delivered earnings growth of 10.4%"
129,"Moving on to slide 17 and our full fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance for stand-alone BD, at a high-level, we expect revenue growth of 4% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis which represents strong underlying growth of 4.5% to 5.5% excluding the impact of the U.S"
130,dispensing change
131,"On a reported basis, revenue growth is expected to be between 5% and 6%, reflecting a currency tailwind of approximately 100 basis points"
132,This assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.18.
133,"From a phasing perspective, as a reminder, in the first quarter we have a very tough comparison to 6.1% revenue growth in the prior year in addition to the impact from the U.S"
134,dispensing change
135,"Moving on to the segments, we expect BD Medical to grow between 4% and 5%, and we also expect our Life Sciences segment to grow between 4% and 5%"
136,Revenue growth contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure
137,We expect revenue growth to continue to be driven by recent product launches across both segments and continued strength in both developed and emerging markets
138,"We expect high single digit growth in emerging markets driven by a diversified base, with China growing low-double digits and continued strength in Latin America"
139,"And in terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 18 to 24 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of around 4% in fiscal 2018."
140,"Now moving on to slide 18 and our full fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance for stand-alone BD, in fiscal year 2018, we expect another year of very strong earnings with 15% to 16% growth on an underlying basis"
141,This includes additional CareFusion cost synergies and aggressive continuous improvement initiatives which will help offset notable headwinds from the U.S
142,"dispensing change and the expected increase in our effective tax rate, resulting in currency neutral earnings growth of approximately 10%"
143,"Assuming current spot rates, we expect currency will provide a tailwind in fiscal 2018, the first time in seven years, resulting in expected EPS growth of approximately 12%"
144,"Now from a phasing perspective, beyond the tough compare for revenues in the first fiscal quarter and the impact of the U.S"
145,"dispensing change, there are a few additional items to consider"
146,"The additional cost base initiatives are not expected to ramp until the second fiscal quarter and the tailwind from foreign currency is not expected to be ratable across the year, but rather disproportionately larger in the second quarter"
147,"Regarding Puerto Rico, our current fiscal 2018 revenue and EPS guidance does not contemplate any potential impact related to Hurricane Maria"
148,"We are still evaluating the impact and estimate it could be as much as $40 million to revenues, with a corresponding impact that could be as much as 1 percentage point of EPS growth"
149,The products manufactured in our three plants in Puerto Rico represent approximately 5% to 6% of total company revenues
150,"All three of our plants are suffering from the destruction of the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, which, as you are aware, has interrupted the supply of power, water and raw materials"
151,Our two plants in Cayey are currently back in production
152,"However, we are still working to scale them to full productivity"
153,"Our third plant, which is located in Juncos, experienced more damage than the plants in Cayey and is not operational today"
154,"With that said, we expect to resume production in Juncos by the end of the first quarter"
155,"While we feel good about our ability to return to full productivity during the fiscal year, this is dependent on several factors that are outside of our control"
156,"Before I move on, I'd like to echo Vince in thanking our associates in Puerto Rico, who over the last six weeks have demonstrated great dedication and perseverance"
157,"Now turning to slide 19, I'd like to walk through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2018."
158,We expect gross profit margin to be between 54% and 55%
159,SSG&A as a percent of sales is expected to be between 23% and 24%
160,"We expect our R&D investment to be in line with fiscal year 2017 at 6% to 7% of revenues, as we continue to invest in new products and platforms"
161,"As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenues, up from 22.9% in fiscal year 2017."
162,"Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve 100 basis points to 150 basis points, bringing our cumulative margin improvement over four years to 600 basis points to 650 basis points"
163,We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%
164,"This is higher than our fiscal 2017 tax rate, which included a number of discrete items"
165,"For fiscal year 2018, we anticipate our adjusted average fully-diluted share count to be approximately 219 million shares"
166,Cash flow is expected to remain strong with operating cash flow of about $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2018.
167,Capital expenditures are expected to be between $800 million and $850 million
168,"With respect to our anticipated acquisition of Bard, things are progressing well"
169,The financial parameters we described when we announced the deal have not changed
170,We will provide guidance for BD plus Bard after the transaction closes
171,"In summary, we have good momentum exiting fiscal 2017, and I'm confident that the fiscal year 2018 will be another strong year of performance"
172,We look forward to the closing of the Bard acquisition
173,"We believe that the combination of BD and Bard will create an even more powerful healthcare company, enhancing value for our customers, patients and shareholders globally"
174,"Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio"
175,So to the second part of that question on the phasing as we look into 2018.
176,"As we said, the toughest compare is in the first quarter, as you know"
177,Second quarter stabilizes a little bit
178,You still got the overhang from the 100 basis points of dispensing and that stabilizes a little bit
179,And then you make up for the first quarter for the most part in the second half of the year
180,"Remember, the third quarter will be a bit of an easier compare because we had a low growth quarter this year in the third quarter"
181,And then fourth quarter is pretty much an average compare
182,"So think about it as a tough compare first quarter, which drives a lower than average first half, made up for in the second half"
183,And I'll take the first one on the year one accretion
184,"So as we said in our prepared remarks, we feel good about the Bard transaction and the financial parameters are in line with what we had articulated at the time of the deal announcement"
185,"Specifically, related to year one accretion, we had said low-single-digit accretion and that still stands"
186,"Bear in mind that was for a full year, we'll probably get nine months, but we still see low-single digit per share accretion"
187,"So on the year one accretion, as I said, the most important thing is all the financial parameters on this deal are consistent with what we had said"
188,"We did give guidance for the full year, to your point, but the interesting thing is it's low-single digits"
189,"It's low-single digits whether you do it over a year or nine months, and so you have the nine months"
190,"We also have the divestiture of what we have to do on the needle biopsy, but we'll give more precise information on that along with multiple other parameters and inputs related to the transaction when we give the full guidance for the transaction in February"
191,But it's consistent low-single digits
192,"Yes, and that's consistent with what we did last quarter as well"
193,"So on the first piece, we really can't say much about Bard at this point"
194,But what we would say is they were fairly straightforward in the impact from Puerto Rico on their side
195,"They did have an impact in their last quarter, and they anticipate having an impact in the next quarter"
196,"But they're back up operating, much like our Cayey plants and are subject to the same power issues that we are"
197,But they don't have the same level of issue that we have at our Juncos plant
198,"They're more like our Cayey plants, which are further along"
199,"So on cash, we actually do have a nice step-up"
200,and we've seen that step-up over the last couple years
201,We're going from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion
202,Most of that is the flow-through of net income
203,"There is a payment of nearly $100 million related to pension payments, that kind of thing, that will have been made"
204,"You'll see that in the 10-K when we file, but a nice drop-through from net income"
205,"SSG&A, you're right"
206,"We did have some additional costs to drive the logistic issues, and we thought that was the right thing to do to drive the revenue and keep our customers happy, and so there was a step-up there"
207,"All in, with that, there were about $20 million or so of cost"
208,And the R&D question that you asked was?
209,"Well, you have the fact that we're scaling, and it's more of the growth is relating to the spending in the prior year, which was lumpy, which had to do with the repeal of the medical device tax"
210,of inventory
211,and the like that occurred
212,So we did overcome that as well
213,"Thanks, everyone"
