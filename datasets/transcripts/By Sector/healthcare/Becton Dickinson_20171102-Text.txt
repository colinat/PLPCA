Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone
I'm also extremely proud of our achievements this year as well as the extraordinary efforts made by our organization in the fourth quarter
Moving on to slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year
Total fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4.4% on a comparable currency-neutral basis
For the total year, revenues of $12.1 billion grew 4.5%, in line with our previously communicated expectations
The fourth quarter and full-year results include the impact from the U.S
dispensing change, which lowered total company revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and 50 basis points for the full year
Excluding this impact, we drove full-year revenue growth of approximately 5%, which is the high end of our full-year guidance range
As Vince mentioned, our underlying performance is strong
As we communicated to you last quarter, our confidence in achieving our outlook was based on strong fourth quarter performance in MMS and Diabetes Care and across the Life Sciences segment, combined with continued strength in emerging markets, all of which we achieved
In addition, through the excellent efforts of our associates and our distribution and logistics partner as well as strength across the business, we overcame the logistics-related issues we described to you in mid-September
I'll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when I take you through the results by segment and geography
We significantly expanded our margins and captured an additional $80 million in annualized synergy cost savings related to CareFusion, reaching $250 million in annualized cost savings on a cumulative basis through the end of fiscal 2017. We are on track to achieve approximately $350 million in total annualized cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2018, which is the high end of our previously communicated range
Adjusted EPS growth of 13.2% in both the fourth quarter and the full year reflects our ability to overcome the dilution from the Respiratory divestiture and the U.S
dispensing change
Combined, these headwinds impacted EPS growth by approximately 700 basis points in the fourth quarter and 400 basis points for the full year
We are also very pleased to have continued our longstanding record of delivering an increasing dividend
Fiscal 2017 marked our 45th year of consecutive dividend increases
Now moving on to slide 9, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a comparable currency-neutral basis
As discussed, fourth quarter revenue growth was 4.4% for the total company, including an estimated headwind of 100 basis points from the U.S
dispensing change
Pricing declined about 10 basis points in both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year
Due to the timing of Hurricane Maria late in our fourth quarter, there was very little impact to our fourth quarter results
BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 3.9% which includes a headwind of 160 basis points from the U.S
dispensing change
For the full fiscal year, Medical revenues grew a strong 4.3% which includes an estimated 80 basis points headwind from the U.S
dispensing change
Medication and Procedural Solutions, or MPS, fourth quarter growth was 1.5%
Broad strength in infusion-related disposables was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year
For the full fiscal year, MPS revenues grew 3.8%
Revenues in Medication Management Solutions, or MMS, grew 6.7% in the fourth quarter including a headwind of approximately 600 basis points from the U.S
dispensing change
Growth in MMS was driven by our international dispensing business and by global strength in infusion
For the full fiscal year, MMS revenues grew 4.9% including a headwind of approximately 300 basis points from the U.S
dispensing change
Diabetes Care revenues grew 6.4%, driven by strong growth of 8.7% in the U.S
and double-digit growth in emerging markets, as expected
International growth continued to be impacted by some softness in Europe, primarily in the UK
For the full fiscal year, Diabetes Care revenues grew 3.6%
Pharmaceutical Systems revenues grew 3.4% in the fourth quarter
Strong growth in Safety and SAIS were partially offset by the impact of timing of customer orders that benefited growth earlier in the fiscal year
For the full fiscal year, Pharmaceutical Systems grew 5.3%
BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 5.4%
Growth was driven by strength across the segment
For the full fiscal year, BD Life Sciences revenues grew 4.8%
Revenues in Diagnostic Systems grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter
Strength in core microbiology was driven by blood culture and IDAST
In addition, we saw continued strong growth in our BD MAX molecular platform
For the full fiscal year, Diagnostic Systems grew 6.4%
Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.3% in the fourth quarter was driven by strength in core products
For the full fiscal year, PAS grew 5.2%
Biosciences revenues grew 5.8% in the fourth quarter
This reflects growth in our newer research instruments such as the FACSMelody and FACSymphony as well as continued strength in research reagents
In addition, FACSLyric, our more recently launched next-generation clinical flow cytometer for HIV and leukemia and lymphoma applications, also contributed to growth in the quarter
For the full fiscal year, Biosciences grew 2.4%
This was driven by strong momentum in the second half of the year, which we expect to continue in fiscal year 2018. Moving to slide 10, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis
U.S
revenues grew 2.1% in the fourth quarter, which includes an estimated headwind of 200 basis points from the U.S
dispensing change
BD Medical revenues grew 2.2% including an estimated headwind of 280 basis points from the dispensing change
BD Life Sciences revenues grew 2% in the U.S
For the fourth quarter, growth in BD Medical in the U.S
was driven by performance in Pharmaceutical Systems, Diabetes Care and the infusion business within MMS
Within MPS, continued strength in prefilled flush devices was offset by a tough comparison to a strong performance in the prior year across the portfolio
For the fourth quarter, BD Life Sciences growth in the U.S
reflects strength in core products in Preanalytical Systems and in Research Instruments and Reagents in Biosciences
Growth in our U.S
Diagnostics business was driven by continued strength in BD MAX, offset by a tough comparison to significant Kiestra installations in the prior year
For the full fiscal year, U.S
revenues were strong, growing 3% despite an estimated headwind of 100 basis points from the U.S
dispensing change
Moving on to International, revenues grew 6.9% in the fourth quarter
Growth of 6% in the Medical segment was driven by performance from infusion-related disposables in the MPS unit and from both the infusion and dispensing businesses in MMS
Within our international dispensing business, strength in emerging markets and strong performance in our retail business in Europe contributed to MMS growth in the quarter
Diabetes Care revenues reflect strength in emerging markets, partially offset by continued softness in Europe, as previously discussed
Growth in the Life Sciences segment of 8.3% was driven by performance across the Diagnostic Systems, Biosciences and PAS
Diagnostic Systems growth reflects strength in core microbiology including IDAST and Kiestra and in BD MAX
Biosciences revenues reflect strong sales of our newer research and clinical instruments
Growth in PAS was driven by strong demand for core products in emerging markets
For the full fiscal year, international revenues grew 6.2%
On slide 11, developed markets revenues were strong, growing 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full fiscal year, despite estimated headwinds from the U.S
dispensing change of 130 basis points and 60 basis points respectively
Fourth quarter emerging markets revenue grew a strong 12.7% currency neutral, bringing our full-year growth to 10.1%, which exceeded our expectations
China growth for the fourth quarter was strong at 13.4%, bringing the total year growth to 11.6%
The fourth quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects broad strength across both segments
By geography, greater Asia, including China and EMA grew double digits and sales in Latin America were up high-single digits
Moving on to global safety on slide 12. Fourth quarter currency-neutral sales increased 3.9% year-over-year
By geography, safety revenues in the U.S
grew 30 basis points while international sales grew 9.1% currency neutral
By segment, fourth quarter Medical safety sales grew 2.7% and Life Sciences safety sales grew 5.9%
, growth in Preanalytical Systems and infusion disposables in MMS was offset by a tough comparison to the prior year
International performance was driven by strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems in China and solid growth in Europe in our Medical segment and strength in China and EMA in Preanalytical Systems
Safety revenues grew 16% in emerging markets in the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full fiscal year
Slide 13 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results
As discussed, revenues grew 4.4% in the quarter on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes approximately 100 basis points negative impact from the U.S
dispensing change
As we move down the P&L, I would like to point out that, similar to our prior quarters, our results in the prior year period include the Respiratory Solutions business while the current period does not, as the business was divested in October 2016. Starting with gross profit, the decline of 50 basis points year-over-year includes approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from the loss of gross profit related to Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S
dispensing change
I'll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment
SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 24.4%
In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional selling and shipping costs related to our efforts to scale shipments in the month of September, as previously discussed
As a result for the full year, SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was slightly above our guidance range
Accounting for the impact from the Respiratory divestiture and the U.S
dispensing change, we are pleased with the leverage we have achieved on an underlying basis, with SSG&A dollars growing slower than revenues
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7%
The decline in R&D dollars spent year-over-year is due to the divestiture of the Respiratory Solutions business as well as the comparison to the prior year where we increased R&D spend in the fourth quarter as a result of the medical device tax suspension
Our tax rate declined to 14.6% in the quarter, resulting in a full year effective tax rate below our guidance range of 15.2%
As you are aware, we expected a lower tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as an offset to the impact of U.S
dispensing change
Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, as you will see when I take you through our adjusted EPS guidance, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate
This is largely the result of discrete items in fiscal 2017 that are not expected to recur
In the quarter, operating income grew 6.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 13.2% compared to the prior year
Both operating income and EPS include approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture and the U.S
dispensing change
Turning to slide 14 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter, as you can see, currency did not have an impact on gross profit margin or operating margin in the quarter
On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 100 basis points as continuous improvement initiatives, cost synergies and favorable mix which includes the positive impact of divestitures were partially offset by slight headwinds from pension and raw materials
As expected, operating margin improved significantly in the fourth quarter, increasing 180 basis points
This was largely driven by the comparison to the high level of R&D spend in the prior year
For the full year, we are extremely pleased to have delivered approximately 180 basis points of underlying margin expansion
As Vince said earlier, over a three-year period we achieved approximately 500 basis points of margin expansion
Moving to slide 15, I'd like to highlight our EPS growth which was in line with our expectations for the total year
Starting with fiscal 2016 EPS of $8.59, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver currency neutral EPS growth of 13.2% while overcoming notable headwinds
The strength of our performance as well as the tax benefit from stock comp accounting and other discrete items drove our ability to offset significant headwinds from the Respiratory Solutions divestiture, the U.S
dispensing change, pension and unfavorable currency
All in, we delivered earnings growth of 10.4%
Moving on to slide 17 and our full fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance for stand-alone BD, at a high-level, we expect revenue growth of 4% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis which represents strong underlying growth of 4.5% to 5.5% excluding the impact of the U.S
dispensing change
On a reported basis, revenue growth is expected to be between 5% and 6%, reflecting a currency tailwind of approximately 100 basis points
This assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.18. From a phasing perspective, as a reminder, in the first quarter we have a very tough comparison to 6.1% revenue growth in the prior year in addition to the impact from the U.S
dispensing change
Moving on to the segments, we expect BD Medical to grow between 4% and 5%, and we also expect our Life Sciences segment to grow between 4% and 5%
Revenue growth contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure
We expect revenue growth to continue to be driven by recent product launches across both segments and continued strength in both developed and emerging markets
We expect high single digit growth in emerging markets driven by a diversified base, with China growing low-double digits and continued strength in Latin America
And in terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 18 to 24 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of around 4% in fiscal 2018. Now moving on to slide 18 and our full fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance for stand-alone BD, in fiscal year 2018, we expect another year of very strong earnings with 15% to 16% growth on an underlying basis
This includes additional CareFusion cost synergies and aggressive continuous improvement initiatives which will help offset notable headwinds from the U.S
dispensing change and the expected increase in our effective tax rate, resulting in currency neutral earnings growth of approximately 10%
Assuming current spot rates, we expect currency will provide a tailwind in fiscal 2018, the first time in seven years, resulting in expected EPS growth of approximately 12%
Now from a phasing perspective, beyond the tough compare for revenues in the first fiscal quarter and the impact of the U.S
dispensing change, there are a few additional items to consider
The additional cost base initiatives are not expected to ramp until the second fiscal quarter and the tailwind from foreign currency is not expected to be ratable across the year, but rather disproportionately larger in the second quarter
Regarding Puerto Rico, our current fiscal 2018 revenue and EPS guidance does not contemplate any potential impact related to Hurricane Maria
We are still evaluating the impact and estimate it could be as much as $40 million to revenues, with a corresponding impact that could be as much as 1 percentage point of EPS growth
The products manufactured in our three plants in Puerto Rico represent approximately 5% to 6% of total company revenues
All three of our plants are suffering from the destruction of the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, which, as you are aware, has interrupted the supply of power, water and raw materials
Our two plants in Cayey are currently back in production
However, we are still working to scale them to full productivity
Our third plant, which is located in Juncos, experienced more damage than the plants in Cayey and is not operational today
With that said, we expect to resume production in Juncos by the end of the first quarter
While we feel good about our ability to return to full productivity during the fiscal year, this is dependent on several factors that are outside of our control
Before I move on, I'd like to echo Vince in thanking our associates in Puerto Rico, who over the last six weeks have demonstrated great dedication and perseverance
Now turning to slide 19, I'd like to walk through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2018. We expect gross profit margin to be between 54% and 55%
SSG&A as a percent of sales is expected to be between 23% and 24%
We expect our R&D investment to be in line with fiscal year 2017 at 6% to 7% of revenues, as we continue to invest in new products and platforms
As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 24% and 25% of revenues, up from 22.9% in fiscal year 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve 100 basis points to 150 basis points, bringing our cumulative margin improvement over four years to 600 basis points to 650 basis points
We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%
This is higher than our fiscal 2017 tax rate, which included a number of discrete items
For fiscal year 2018, we anticipate our adjusted average fully-diluted share count to be approximately 219 million shares
Cash flow is expected to remain strong with operating cash flow of about $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $800 million and $850 million
With respect to our anticipated acquisition of Bard, things are progressing well
The financial parameters we described when we announced the deal have not changed
We will provide guidance for BD plus Bard after the transaction closes
In summary, we have good momentum exiting fiscal 2017, and I'm confident that the fiscal year 2018 will be another strong year of performance
We look forward to the closing of the Bard acquisition
We believe that the combination of BD and Bard will create an even more powerful healthcare company, enhancing value for our customers, patients and shareholders globally
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio
So to the second part of that question on the phasing as we look into 2018. As we said, the toughest compare is in the first quarter, as you know
Second quarter stabilizes a little bit
You still got the overhang from the 100 basis points of dispensing and that stabilizes a little bit
And then you make up for the first quarter for the most part in the second half of the year
Remember, the third quarter will be a bit of an easier compare because we had a low growth quarter this year in the third quarter
And then fourth quarter is pretty much an average compare
So think about it as a tough compare first quarter, which drives a lower than average first half, made up for in the second half
And I'll take the first one on the year one accretion
So as we said in our prepared remarks, we feel good about the Bard transaction and the financial parameters are in line with what we had articulated at the time of the deal announcement
Specifically, related to year one accretion, we had said low-single-digit accretion and that still stands
Bear in mind that was for a full year, we'll probably get nine months, but we still see low-single digit per share accretion
So on the year one accretion, as I said, the most important thing is all the financial parameters on this deal are consistent with what we had said
We did give guidance for the full year, to your point, but the interesting thing is it's low-single digits
It's low-single digits whether you do it over a year or nine months, and so you have the nine months
We also have the divestiture of what we have to do on the needle biopsy, but we'll give more precise information on that along with multiple other parameters and inputs related to the transaction when we give the full guidance for the transaction in February
But it's consistent low-single digits
Yes, and that's consistent with what we did last quarter as well
So on the first piece, we really can't say much about Bard at this point
But what we would say is they were fairly straightforward in the impact from Puerto Rico on their side
They did have an impact in their last quarter, and they anticipate having an impact in the next quarter
But they're back up operating, much like our Cayey plants and are subject to the same power issues that we are
But they don't have the same level of issue that we have at our Juncos plant
They're more like our Cayey plants, which are further along
So on cash, we actually do have a nice step-up and we've seen that step-up over the last couple years
We're going from $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion
Most of that is the flow-through of net income
There is a payment of nearly $100 million related to pension payments, that kind of thing, that will have been made
You'll see that in the 10-K when we file, but a nice drop-through from net income
SSG&A, you're right
We did have some additional costs to drive the logistic issues, and we thought that was the right thing to do to drive the revenue and keep our customers happy, and so there was a step-up there
All in, with that, there were about $20 million or so of cost
And the R&D question that you asked was?
Well, you have the fact that we're scaling, and it's more of the growth is relating to the spending in the prior year, which was lumpy, which had to do with the repeal of the medical device tax
of inventory and the like that occurred
So we did overcome that as well
Thanks, everyone
