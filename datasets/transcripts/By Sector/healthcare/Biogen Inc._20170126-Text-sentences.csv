70,Let me turn to our full year 2017 guidance
71,"Guidance this year has a few more moving pieces due to the spin-off of Bioverativ: Our focus on Biogen's 2017 guidance; but also provide additional context on Bioverativ in what we call WholeCo, the combined companies"
72,I'd refer you to the slides for today's call for reference
73,There are a couple of items of note before I go into the substance of the Biogen guidance
74,"First, there will be a stub period for the full month of January, where Hemophilia will be part of Biogen, not Bioverativ"
75,"Second, our, our GAAP guidance includes the minimum expense we expect to record in 2017 upon the effectiveness of our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma"
76,The actual charges for this recorded will depend on the outcome of the patent office proceedings in the U.S
77,and EU.
78,"Third, our guidance does not include any impact from potential corporate tax reform in the U.S"
79,", repatriation or changes to the Affordable Care Act"
80,And our plan is based on recent rates for foreign exchange
81,"Now, let's get into Biogen guidance, starting with revenues"
82,We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion
83,"This includes one month of Hemophilia revenues, which equates to approximately $75 million"
84,"This represents 5% to 7% growth on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for Hemophilia revenues, for both 2016 and January of this year"
85,"Starting with MS, our plan assumes OCREVUS is approved this year and launches in the U.S"
86,and Germany in the first half of 2017.
87,We anticipate relatively stable demand for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in 2017 on a global basis
88,This is comprised of ex U.S
89,"patient growth, offsetting modest patient declines in the U.S"
90,"We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline, as the market continues to shift away from the platforms"
91,"We anticipate continued strong growth from our Biosimilar business, predominantly driven by BENEPALI"
92,Moving to SPINRAZA
93,"We're very excited about bringing this therapy to patients, with such high unmet need"
94,We're assuming the vast majority of SPINRAZA revenue this year will be in the U.S
95,We're cognizant that there are near-term capacity constraints in the system and the need for patients to secure reimbursement
96,"So, we expect the revenue uptake to be gradual in 2017."
97,"Nevertheless, clearly, the kinetics of the launch are the biggest ambiguity in our outlook"
98,"Now, moving to expenses"
99,"We expect upward pressure on cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in 2017, largely due to the increase in royalties related to the sales of SPINRAZA and our Biosimilars revenue becoming a larger portion of the business"
100,We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales
101,"We anticipate additional expense driven by advancing our Alzheimer's programs, notably, aducanumab and the BACE inhibitor; as well as the desire to build our pipeline to business development"
102,"Guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict"
103,"SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues, a decrease from 2016, driven by the reduction in head count related to the Hemophilia spin and continued diligent focus on improving inefficiencies"
104,We're re-allocating resources to maintain our leadership position in MS
105,Ad we have resourced SPINRAZA for an excellent launch
106,"From a tax perspective, we anticipate our tax rate for 2017 to be largely comparable to 2016."
107,"For Biogen, we anticipate GAAP EPS results of $18 to $18.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $20.45 and $21.25."
108,Our shareholders will also benefit from the earnings of Bioverativ
109,"As a reminder, eligible shareholders will receive one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock"
110,"On an apples-to-apples basis, we aim to grow earnings per share for Biogen in the double digits on a pro forma basis"
111,I'll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing remarks
