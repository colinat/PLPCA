Thanks, Mike
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.99 in the fourth quarter and $16.93 for the full year
GAAP earnings per share were negatively impacted by $1.55 related to the settlement in license agreement with Forward Pharma
Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.04 in the fourth quarter and $20.22 for the full year
Total revenue for Q4 grew 1% year-over-year to approximately $2.9 billion and grew 6% for the full year to $11.4 billion
Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1 billion
This included revenues of $800 million in the U.S
, an increase of 2% versus Q4 last year, and $202 million outside the U.S
, a decrease of 3% versus Q4 of last year
As a reminder, in Q3, we believe TECFIDERA U.S
revenue benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million due to inventory build in the channel, which impacts the sequential quarter comparison
On a sequential basis, we believe inventory levels remained relatively constant
For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $4 billion, an increase of 9% versus prior year
This included $3.2 billion in the U.S
and $799 million in sales outside the U.S
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $688 million during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 7% versus Q4 last year
This included $488 million in the U.S
and $200 million in sales outside the U.S
For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $2.8 billion, consisting of $2 billion in the U.S
and $815 million in sales outside the U.S
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $474 million this quarter, a decrease of 1% versus Q4 last year
This included $289 million in the U.S
and $185 million outside the U.S
, Q4 TYSABRI revenue was unfavorably impacted by an increase in discounts and allowances specific to this quarter
For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were $2 billion, a 4% increase versus the prior year
We recorded U.S
revenues of $1.2 billion and $781 million internationally
Foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened full-year revenue by approximately $66 million for TECFIDERA, $79 million for interferons, and $62 million for TYSABRI versus prior year
As a reminder, with respect to ZINBRYTA, in the United States, we don't book in market revenue, we book a profit share
And in Q4, we experienced a contra revenue to the total revenue line
Our Hemophilia products continued to perform well this quarter
ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $149 million, an increase of 47% versus Q4 last year
This includes $126 million in the U.S
and $23 million outside the U.S
For the full year, world-wide ELOCTATE revenues were $513 million
We recorded U.S
revenue of $445 million, and $68 million internationally
ALPROLIX revenues in Q4 were $93 million, an increase of 31%, versus Q4 last year, including $74 million in the U.S
and $20 million outside of the U.S
For the full year, worldwide ALPROLIX revenues were $334 million
We recorded U.S
revenue of $268 million and $66 million internationally
Our Biosimilar business generated $53 million in revenues this quarter, and full-year Biosimilar revenues were $101 million
Turning to our Anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $318 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year
Total Other revenues were $51 million in Q4 and $316 million for the full year
Now turning to the expense line on the P&L
Q4 GAAP cost of goods sold was $378 million; non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $363 million; both 13% of revenue
Full-year GAAP COGS were 1.5 billion or 13% of revenue
And full year non-GAAP COGS were 1.4 billion or 12% of revenue
Q4 GAAP R&D expense was $534 million or 19% of revenue
Q4 non-GAAP R&D was $531 million or 18% of revenue
Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $50 million payment milestone to Eisai in Q4, following the dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase 3 program for the BACE inhibitor
Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were $2 billion, both 17% of revenue
Q4 GAAP SG&A was $496 million; Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was $484 million; both 17% of revenue
Both full-year GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A were $1.9 billion or 17 % of revenue
Throughout the year, we continued to execute on a number of measures to curb operating expense growth, while continuing to invest in R&D in key commercial priorities
We believe the benefits materialized in both the fourth quarter and full year results
We booked a GAAP-only charge in Q4 of $455 million related to our recent settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma
Upon effectiveness of this agreement, we've agreed to pay Forward Pharma $1.25 billion plus potential royalties
The charge in Q4 represents the portion of the payment attributable to the sales of TECFIDERA during the period April 2014 through December 31, 2016. GAAP other net expense, which includes interest was $48 million in Q4 and $217 million for the full year
Non-GAAP other net expense was $52 million in Q4 and $222 million for the full year
In Q4, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 23%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24%
For the full year, both GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 217 million for Q4 and 219 million for the full year, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share
For Q4, we booked $2.99 on a GAAP basis and $5.04 on a non-GAAP basis
For the full year, GAAP EPS was $16.93, and non-GAAP EPS was $20.22, representing a strong 10% and 19% growth year-over-year, respectively
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $651 million
We ended the quarter with approximately $7.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 30% of this in the U.S
In 2017, we expect to continue repurchasing shares as part of our previously announced $5 billion share repurchase program
Let me turn to our full year 2017 guidance
Guidance this year has a few more moving pieces due to the spin-off of Bioverativ: Our focus on Biogen's 2017 guidance; but also provide additional context on Bioverativ in what we call WholeCo, the combined companies
I'd refer you to the slides for today's call for reference
There are a couple of items of note before I go into the substance of the Biogen guidance
First, there will be a stub period for the full month of January, where Hemophilia will be part of Biogen, not Bioverativ
Second, our, our GAAP guidance includes the minimum expense we expect to record in 2017 upon the effectiveness of our settlement and license agreement with Forward Pharma
The actual charges for this recorded will depend on the outcome of the patent office proceedings in the U.S
and EU. Third, our guidance does not include any impact from potential corporate tax reform in the U.S
, repatriation or changes to the Affordable Care Act
And our plan is based on recent rates for foreign exchange
Now, let's get into Biogen guidance, starting with revenues
We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion
This includes one month of Hemophilia revenues, which equates to approximately $75 million
This represents 5% to 7% growth on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for Hemophilia revenues, for both 2016 and January of this year
Starting with MS, our plan assumes OCREVUS is approved this year and launches in the U.S
and Germany in the first half of 2017. We anticipate relatively stable demand for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in 2017 on a global basis
This is comprised of ex U.S
patient growth, offsetting modest patient declines in the U.S
We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline, as the market continues to shift away from the platforms
We anticipate continued strong growth from our Biosimilar business, predominantly driven by BENEPALI
Moving to SPINRAZA
We're very excited about bringing this therapy to patients, with such high unmet need
We're assuming the vast majority of SPINRAZA revenue this year will be in the U.S
We're cognizant that there are near-term capacity constraints in the system and the need for patients to secure reimbursement
So, we expect the revenue uptake to be gradual in 2017. Nevertheless, clearly, the kinetics of the launch are the biggest ambiguity in our outlook
Now, moving to expenses
We expect upward pressure on cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in 2017, largely due to the increase in royalties related to the sales of SPINRAZA and our Biosimilars revenue becoming a larger portion of the business
We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales
We anticipate additional expense driven by advancing our Alzheimer's programs, notably, aducanumab and the BACE inhibitor; as well as the desire to build our pipeline to business development
Guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions, as both are hard to predict
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues, a decrease from 2016, driven by the reduction in head count related to the Hemophilia spin and continued diligent focus on improving inefficiencies
We're re-allocating resources to maintain our leadership position in MS
Ad we have resourced SPINRAZA for an excellent launch
From a tax perspective, we anticipate our tax rate for 2017 to be largely comparable to 2016. For Biogen, we anticipate GAAP EPS results of $18 to $18.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $20.45 and $21.25. Our shareholders will also benefit from the earnings of Bioverativ
As a reminder, eligible shareholders will receive one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock
On an apples-to-apples basis, we aim to grow earnings per share for Biogen in the double digits on a pro forma basis
I'll now turn the call over to Michel for his closing remarks
