0,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today"
1,"Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tom McCarthy for his many years of service with Cigna"
2,As you know Tom announced his retirement this past February
3,"Tom has not only been an instrumental leader within our organization for more than three decades with considerable accomplishments and contributions to our growth and success, he's also a good friend to many of us, and we'll miss him on a both personal and professional level"
4,Tom's excited to start his next chapter
5,and I know you'll join me in wishing him and Linda (3:51)
6,all the best in his upcoming retirement
7,"Also, Eric Palmer will be stepping into our CFO role the summer"
8,"Eric's a proven financially leader with a strong track record of accomplishments over his 20 years with our company, and I'm confident in the value he'll bring to the role"
9,Eric's looking forward to discussions with you as we look ahead to Cigna's future and he'll be joining us for the Q&A portion of today's call
10,"To begin this morning's call, I'll briefly highlight our strong financial results"
11,"I'll then discuss how our approach to engaging, incenting and supporting our customers and healthcare professionals, combined with our ongoing investments in innovative capabilities, continues to fuel our growth and drive differentiated value for our stakeholders"
12,Tom will then address our first quarter financial results in more detail as well as provide more specifics for increased outlook for 2017 before we take your questions
13,And after Q&A I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks
14,I'll start with some highlights of our results
15,We started off 2017 with strong momentum in earnings growth across each of Cigna's business segments
16,"For the first quarter of 2017, consolidated revenue increased 5% to more than $10 billion"
17,We achieved 20% earnings growth with adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $719 million or $2.77 per share
18,"Our Global Health Care business delivered earnings growth of 12% over the first quarter of 2016 with strong customer growth across all Commercial market segments, increased contributions from specialty solutions, well-managed medical costs and effective operating expense management"
19,"Revenue growth in our Commercial employer business continues to be very strong as we retain, expand and add new customer relationships across National Accounts, Middle Market, Select and our International market segments"
20,"In the Individual market, we continue to take a measured approach, participating where we can best deliver value and accumulate learnings as that very dynamic environment continues to evolve"
21,"And in our Seniors business, we expect be in position to participate in the Open Enrollment cycle this fall"
22,In our Global Supplemental Benefits business Cigna again had double-digit revenue and earnings growth while continuing to make targeted investments to support future growth
23,Results from our Group Disability and Life business are benefiting from continued stable results in our Life portfolio and further improvements in our Disability performance
24,"Overall, we began 2017 with strong momentum that we expect to carry through the remainder of the year and as such have increased our outlook for revenue, medical customer growth and EPS"
25,"Now I'd like to transition to how our ongoing value creation for you, our shareholders, goes hand-in-hand with improving the lives of our customers"
26,"As you know, we remain focused on enhancing access to affordable personalized quality care when and where health care services are consumed, all while we continue to expand peace of mind solutions for our customers around the world"
27,"We continue to innovate new ways to incentivize, engage and support both customers and providers of healthcare in a very localized manner, an approach which our experience shows helps to identify health risks earlier while also providing customers with greater value when they do need health services"
28,Our proven approach begins with active listening to best understand and address the specific evolving needs of our customers and clients
29,"This critical first step fuels our highly consultative solution oriented actions where we leverage our broad portfolio of programs and services and our collaborative relationships with healthcare professionals to deliver high-value, personalized solutions at a local level"
30,We also actively engage customers and providers to facilitate the achievement of individual health goals and to strengthen incentive alignment particularly for our highest performing health care partners
31,"Further, by leveraging data and insights we are better positioned to identify health risks at an earlier stage and take actions which allow us to improve the quality of health outcomes at a lower cost"
32,"As for scale and reach, our collaborative arrangements now total approximately 250 physician-based group arrangements"
33,In addition to these partnerships we also have value-based arrangements in place with more than 125 hospital systems comprised of hundreds of individual hospitals spanning more than 30 states
34,We view our continued strength in Collaborative Accountable Care as paramount to accelerating the shared goals of increased value and sustainability across the healthcare system
35,"Taken together with our innovative clinical programs and broad array of specialty health programs, we continue to deliver industry-leading medical cost trend which directly benefits our customers and clients and as such you, our shareholders"
36,"In addition to our proven partnerships with healthcare professionals, we are taking our alignment and collaborative approach to pharmaceutical companies"
37,"We have created seven such arrangements in the past two years that base reimbursement on the efficacy of the drug, not just the consumption or volume of the drug"
38,Our leadership and innovation in the space was recently recognized by the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute with their excellence award in recognition of Cigna's strategic efforts to change the reimbursement model with drug manufacturers from volume to value as well as our use of outcome-based contracts which link financial terms to measured improvements in our customers health and our use of insights to inform future affordability strategies
39,"These accomplishments represent a clear source of sustainable value creation for our business going forward, and as such, shareholder value creation"
40,Our engagement with communities where we operate further complements our strategic growth initiatives and local focus
41,"Because health is so highly personal and highly local, we believe that taking steps to demonstrably improve the health of the communities we serve is critical to creating a more sustainable healthcare system which in turn creates a better environment"
42,We actively use our individual engagement tools to decrease the health risks in the communities we serve
43,These tools include differentiated partnerships as well as our information and insights and broad clinical programs
44,"For example, we're working with communities to address the U.S"
45,opioid addiction issue
46,We started in early 2016 by convening diverse leaders from public and private sectors and local communities across the U.S
47,to LA and from Chicago to Houston
48,And with these leaders we are taking action to stem addiction before it starts as well as address the needs for those who are addicted
49,"Additionally Cigna is committed to reducing our customers' opioid use by 25% by 2019 to take us back to pre-crisis levels, while still providing the right care at the right time for our customers"
50,"To date, more than 150 forward-looking physician groups with nearly 62,000 physicians have signed on to actively honor our shared pledge, which is driving meaningful improvement already"
51,"For example, to-date, we've already delivered a 12% reduction in our customers use of opioid pharmaceuticals"
52,"Another example of our focus on communities is the Cigna Health Improvement Tour, a multi-city tour bringing free health screening and health coaching to communities nationwide so people can learn their numbers for four key indicators of chronic health concerns including blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and BMI"
53,"To date, our tour has visited 18 cities and has had interactions with thousands of people"
54,"Our approach to partnering with our communities is another pathway towards creating greater access to more affordable, personalized and a more sustainable healthcare system"
55,"Now as I noted earlier, creating differentiated value for our clients and customers also enables us to deliver differentiated value for you, our shareholders"
56,A part of that value is underscored in our exceptionally strong capital position and strategic financial flexibility at Cigna
57,"We continue to expect to have over $5 billion of deployable capital at the parent company level in 2017, a testament to the strength and capital efficiency of our operating businesses"
58,"Given our under-levered balance sheet, as previous discussed, we also expect a significant increased degree of capital deployment capacity by returning to more normalized leverage ratios"
59,"Consistent with our prior comments, depending on the mix of share repurchase, dividend and M&A, we continue to expect capital deployment capacity of $7 billion to $14 billion in 2017."
60,We remain very well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder value over the long-term through a combination of strong organic revenue earnings growth and effective capital deployment
61,I'll now briefly touch upon the status of our proposed combination with Anthem
62,"As you saw last week, the U.S"
63,Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court enjoining the merger
64,This morning Anthem announced that it has filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court seeking a review of the decision by the Court of Appeals
65,"On May 8, there will be a hearing in the Delaware Chancery Court to determine Cigna's rights to terminate the merger agreement"
66,We will update you when there is additional news to share
67,"Now before I hand the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate a few key points"
68,The momentum we closed 2016 with has continued into 2017.
69,We've started the year with strong results highlighted by double-digit earnings growth and strength in each of our operating business segments
70,This performance gives us added confidence that we will achieve our increased 2017 earnings outlook which is now a growth rate of 15% to 20% versus 2016.
71,"We're continuing to deliver value with an emphasis on personalization, affordability and being the partner of choice"
72,Over the last couple of years we've positioned ourselves through ongoing investments in innovative capabilities and programs
73,"We are positioned with outstanding capital strength, and as a global health service company we are creating significant value for all of our stakeholders thanks to the passion and dedication of our Cigna colleagues around the world"
74,"And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom"
75,"Kevin, good morning; it's David"
76,"First, just at a macro level, we're quite pleased with the start of year, and just putting it into context, we set a pretty meaningful earnings growth goal for the organization for 2017 in the 12% to 18% range"
77,and we're quite pleased to start with this strength and raise that outlook to a 15% to 20% range
78,It's early in the year
79,"We feel really good about the fundamentals from the revenue to the customer life growth, to the foundational aspects within the business, and look forward to a very good year"
80,"There's nothing beyond other than a strong start to the year, we feel quite good about raising the outlook, and it's early in the year"
81,", hence we think the raise is appropriate and for an (26:24) appropriate range"
82,"Kevin, I'll just frame it and ask Eric to give you a little bit relative to the way our medical costs more broadly are unfolding"
83,"First off, to put it back in context, we're starting the year again quite positive"
84,"The -- put it back into context, 2016"
85,we delivered another very strong year of below 4% medical cost trend
86,"We set an expectation for ourself for this year of 4.5% to 5.5%, and we're performing well within those -- the construct"
87,We typically don't break out the prior year development by micro line of business
88,Eric can give you a little bit direction there
89,and then the little bit of color relative to just the core medical cost trend we're seeing within the business by some of the categories
90,"First, broadly relative to the PBM, our view relative to the services we need to deliver is that the broad-based pharmacy capabilities are one of the most critical capabilities to have an overall effective health service offering"
91,"To put your question back into context and be clear, today we own and fully operate our PBM and continue to"
92,"We partner where appropriate, and work to actively integrate our capabilities, and we're quite pleased with the outcomes we're delivering for the benefit of our customers, the service, the clinical quality"
93,"Eric just made reference to the sustained medical cost trend in the mid-single digit range, great value for our employer clients"
94,"And importantly, our approach to the integrated PBM presents even a further opportunity to integrate the information, the clinical program, the gap in care closure with our health care professionals"
95,"So own and operate, partner where appropriate, it's performing well and we're pleased"
96,"Lastly, in addition to the trend, I would note we've continued to successfully grow our PBM covered lives of our customer base pretty meaningfully"
97,and I think that's also a testament to the value we're delivering
98,So performing very well for us
99,"Well, first and foremost, as we stepped into this process early on and we've set an extremely aggressive push for our organization to attempt to get all of the issues resolved before the prior year's Open Enrollment process, acknowledging that it was an extraordinary, at least short timeframe based on historical standards"
100,"Once that window eclipsed we set our sights toward, obviously, fully finishing the remediation work, which we're at the final aspects of"
101,"Point two is ensuring that we position ourselves to come out of this phase with an even stronger business unit, operating platform, and team"
102,"and we're literally in the latter chapters of the body of work, ongoing dialogue, interaction with CMS as we speak"
103,"Lastly, just to reinforce, we're pleased with, while we don't like to shrink, we're pleased with the fact that our retention rates held up quite strongly through this process and I think that's a further validation and testament to the strength of the physician partnerships and collaboratives, with 85% of all of our MA lives in collaboratives and our very strong HealthSpring team that wakes up every day to serve our customers"
104,So we're in the final chapter
105,"We're having ongoing interaction and dialogue with CMS and we're planning for, in all aspects, to be in the fall enrollment cycle"
106,"Yeah, it's David"
107,Thank you for the question
108,"First and foremost, we're quite pleased with our customer growth coming into the year"
109,"We've set an objective for ourselves to grow in the 300,000 to 500,000 range"
110,and we're able to increase that outlook
111,"First, broadly speaking, we've seen strong retention results, good new business adds and good expansion of relationships across all of our Commercial business segment"
112,So quite important
113,Specific to the U.S
114,"National Accounts,"
115,"and as you know we define National Accounts as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state"
116,"The employment base in that market has more stabilized now versus the continued 2% or so attrition, broadly speaking, as you look at the marketplace"
117,"We've had a great selling season coming into 2017, outstanding retention, good expansion, and good new business adds"
118,"I would add to the notion of our approach, that consultative approach is working quite well here in our National Account team, both our sales team, our client management team, aided by our informatics experts and our clinicians who've just done an outstanding job"
119,Those employers are benefiting by our superior medical cost trend and it's working quite well in the market
120,"The only add I would give you, A"
121,", is that we did see some further contributions to the National Account number off of some private exchange growth, as well, which is additive to this"
122,I would say it's complementary
123,but the foundation performed quite well
124,"And then in our target go-deep markets and geographies, we saw some good growth on private exchange as well"
125,"So net-net, a strong Commercial performance"
126,", a bunch of questions there"
127,Let me try to frame the environment as we see it
128,"First, as you know, we've taken a very measured approach since the inception of the exchanges to this marketplace"
129,We've been in a range of five to seven states and 2% to 4% of our enterprise revenue in these programs
130,We still have to engage here to learn and to evolve the programs we've put in place
131,And we've seen some successful recipes by using our highly performing collaborative models
132,"Specific to your question, our growth is about where we expected it to be"
133,"The locations of our growth, the aggregate growth and our performance in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be as well"
134,"Relative to 2018, while it's already late in the cycle, unfortunately it's too early to declare because as you know, the evolving rules, regs and positioning coming out of Washington is still pretty dynamic and we're tracking it day-to-day and working with the federal government"
135,So growth in line with our expectations
136,First quarter performance in line with our expectations
137,Highly focused in seven states today and highly focused through our collaborative relationships
138,Stay tuned for more relative to 2018 as the final fact set closes relative to the regulatory environment
139,"Ralph, just framing it from a broad standpoint, our sales and client management team, supported by our underwriters, informatics and clinical team; we attempt to approach the market in terms of a solution orientation"
140,"So understanding the clients' needs; understanding their health burden; understanding their culture and strategy; understanding their readiness to change; recommend a series of programs: service, design, et cetera; and then engage with them on funding approach with a pretty agnostic orientation relative to ASO, ASO stop-loss experience-rated guaranteed cost"
141,And that's one of our strengths
142,And you'll see ebbs and flows over time
143,Now we had good growth in all of our customer segments for 2017 thus far and good growth in all of our funding mechanisms
144,I wouldn't call out anything unique relative to experience-rated there
145,"It's a part of our franchise that we've used over quite some time; and typically, that hunts well in the middle market"
146,"Lastly as I said to a prior call, we saw a little bit more uptick in the private exchange lives"
147,They were split about 50-50; you could think about that between ASO and guaranteed cost on the National Account franchise
148,"So, again, nothing to call out other than strong growth and leveraging the broad portfolio of funding mechanisms we have"
149,"Ralph, on the long-term we're looking forward"
150,"As we've discussed in the past, one of our M&A capital deployment priorities is to seek opportunities to expand, as we say our capabilities to serve Government-based high-risk programs over time"
151,We believe the marketplace will continue to evolve to use more actively managed and collaborative-oriented programs relative to both state and federal programs that serve the higher-risk population
152,"And over time, we see opportunities in a more localized manner to pursue those as we look to the future"
153,"Justin, it's David"
154,Good morning
155,"First and foremost, we're pleased with the performance"
156,"We saw a step up in Q3 of last year, Q4 we see strong performance in the first quarter this year with stable ongoing results on the Life side"
157,The Disability results were a little stronger in the first quarter than even we had anticipated which is good
158,And we're pleased to take up the outlook for that line of business
159,"As we look forward to the core of your question, we remain fully focused on completing all the bodies of work that are in front of us relative to stabilizing that business"
160,And our expressed objective is that we step out of 2017 with the full strength of that organization as we look to 2018.
161,"That's our objective, and we're well on our way relative to that goal"
162,"Justin, relative to Monday's court review and decision, not helpful for us to speculate on the outcome or the timing of that"
163,"Clearly, we'll be in position to communicate as quickly as possible, and recognize the importance relative to that, but not helpful for us to speculate on the timing or the outcome there, but it's on the immediate horizon"
164,"To the core of your question, we would challenge ourself once there's open clarity to be as comprehensive and timely as possible for our shareholders to communicate next steps for our organization"
165,And I would think you'd have confidence that we've always been both transparent and responsive and we would seek to be highly transparent and responsive as soon as the window opens to have that conversation
166,"The way we would frame it, I'm not sure how you're applying the net gross et cetera"
167,We would view that as the net number that our clients and customers experience and noting that the vast majority of our business is self-funded
168,That's the net number of what they're seeing
169,"And of course, you used the term buy downs"
170,Evolution of the benefit programs is obvious factored in and contemplated within that
171,"Gary, David"
172,Not helpful to try to put a pin point number on that
173,"Most important piece, we remain fully focused, aligned and prepared for the Open Enrollment process for the fall cycle"
174,Beyond that not helpful to expand further
175,"Gary, it's David"
176,First I compliment the efficiency of getting four questions in
177,Well done on your part
178,"Specific to Monday, we're not going to expand further in terms of speculating the outcome relative to the court"
179,"We leave it to the courts to draw the conclusion, and we will communicate this immediately as quickly as possible after there's clarity in terms of next steps"
180,"Chris, it's David"
181,"As I indicated to a prior question relative to the outlook, first off, macro â€"
182,“ we set a pretty meaningful increase relative to the franchise performance for 2017 as we stepped into the year
183,We're pleased to actually have such a strong quarter and be able to raise our outlook
184,There is nothing unique to call out
185,"It's just early in the year, a variety of moving parts, and we look forward to continuing to deliver strength as we look forward"
186,But there's nothing unique to call out relative to moving items within the Global Health Care business
187,"Our organization's orientation is going to be as soon as sanctions are lifted, we're ready to roll"
188,The team is anxious to get back into the marketplace
189,"It's a very capable, prideful, passionate team that have the deep position partnerships, and everybody's ready to move as soon we're given the green light relative to CMS's conclusion"
190,"So if that happens prior to the Open Enrollment cycle, there'll be activation in the current year, et cetera"
191,"Peter, let me try to package the framework of your questions together and try to be responsive to all the items you raised"
192,"First and foremost, stepping back, most important headline, we're pleased with our outlook"
193,"Remember, we've set an expectation for ourselves to grow 300,000 to 500,000 lives, so we expect it to grow across our business"
194,We had expectations to grow the Individual business
195,We had expectation to grow the Commercial business
196,We understood we would strengthen the Seniors business
197,That was contemplated within that
198,"Within all of our businesses, we're essentially in line with expectations save for a little bit more strength in the National Accounts and a little bit more strength in the regional markets"
199,"So headline, we expect it to grow"
200,"We've grown across all of our funding mechanisms, and by line of business or by segment, in line with expectations with a bit more strength in National Accounts, which is great, as well as the regional segment"
201,"Point two, you identified a bunch of risks"
202,I maybe go to the end of your question and work my way back
203,"As I discussed before, our approach has been for quite some time not to be in a position to sell products but rather to try to put in place a framework of solutions"
204,"So having the capabilities to do so is one thing, having the talent to do so is another thing, and having the information and infrastructure to support that is another thing"
205,"While our organization is far from perfect, we're sitting on a decade of investments to be able to deliver that, and our really talented team is able to be consultative in support of our clients and customers in the marketplace today and move the levers that best match those clients' needs relative to benefit design, engagement, incentive, network design, collaborative leverage, and then get the right funding mechanism in place"
206,"And the proof is in the pudding in terms of multiple years of lowest industry medical cost trend, last year below 4%"
207,"Targeted 4.5% to 5.5% for this your, performing in line with those expectations and moving forward"
208,"Now to try to come back to the core of your question, if you had to pin us down in terms of what would be the number one variable that sits in front of us right now, you still have to come back to the Individual market just because as an industry there's variability relative to that"
209,I would remind you it remains less than 5% of overall revenue for our organization
210,We're focused in seven states
211,"We exited three states coming into 2017 where we couldn't get the recipe we wanted in place, and the vast majority of what we're doing right now are aligned to the physician collaboratives and we performed, generally speaking, in line with our expectations for the first quarter"
212,But there would be more variability in that than our other lines of business just because of the nature of that animal
213,"But we're off to a start with the number of lives, the location of the lives, and the performance of those lives year-to-date, already"
214,"Well, Dave, remember first and foremost, if you take National Accounts, think about that marketplace as traditionally largely self-funded"
215,So let's go back to the base frame
216,"Outstanding retention year, so clients who are experiencing the service value proposition medical cost trend, et cetera, are pleased, therefore, staying with us"
217,"We could either drive innovation, changes, et cetera, but it starts with really strong retention"
218,"Second is earning the right to expand relationships with our existing corporate clients, either through adding new geographies for medical or further expanding the specialty solutions which is a cornerstone of our strategy, and then targeted new business adds"
219,"As I noted earlier, we've also been able to perform on some of the private exchanges"
220,There we orient relative to our very targeted go-deep orientation on key geographies where we believe we have a differentiated value proposition from collaboratives or otherwise and target some opportunities there
221,So we feel quite good about the quality of the business that's been put in the books
222,"Important to underscore though, this all starts with an outstanding retention result"
223,"Outstanding retention in National, regional and Select"
224,"then further expansion, then targeted adds"
225,"Sarah, good morning, it's David"
226,"We obviously, we've always talked about our growth strategy being oriented around retain, expand, add, because again you have to deliver on your promise relative to your existing clients and customers to earn the right, first off, to keep the relationships, ideally to expand the relationships on the targeted basis, and then new business adds"
227,"We talk within our corporation around a culture and an environment of customer centricity, putting the customer in the center of all we do"
228,I forget how many years ago it was
229,"We started measuring Net Promoter Score on a global basis multiple years ago, feels like five years ago or so"
230,We have it built into the incentive structure of the organization for everybody in the organization from me on down to anybody who's in a variable reward structure
231,And we think it's an important part
232,"It's not the singular part, but it's an important part of understanding both relational NPS"
233,", that's the aggregate relationship, the loyalty factor et cetera"
234,But then you have the ability to get really pinpointed as well in terms of transactional NPS
235,It helps you actually guide your business during the course of the year as opposed to waiting for the longer-tailed relational
236,So you want to look at both of those pieces of the equation
237,And lastly to further expand this
238,", we carry that orientation beyond our customers to our clients and our key health care professional partners as well"
239,"Understanding that orientation of beyond satisfaction, loyalty effect, and where dissatisfiers are versus satisfiers and continuing your innovative evolution around that is mission-critical"
240,"So we've been committed to this for a long period of time, and it's one of the mechanisms we use around our customer-centricity focus"
241,"Sarah, I would think about it intermediate to long term"
242,This is not a 12-month horizon item for us currently
243,"Ana, a big picture, no is the answer"
244,We don't see any disruption relative to that
245,"So, yes, we expect the growth rate to sustain going-forward"
246,"And as you step back from it, having the â€"
247,"“ our belief that is then having the transparent funding mechanisms to better align ourselves with the employers, enables us to have daily, weekly, monthly interaction with the employers as opposed to an annual interaction relative to the performance"
248,"And then dynamically manage, engage in how the programs are operating"
249,"For the smaller side of the employer space, as you move down beyond National into the lower end of Middle Market and into Select, the stop-loss component adds a measure of certainty and predictably for the employers"
250,and it augments
251,We never viewed that the prior law with the tax was an accelerant
252,"We don't view that the current proposed changes will be a decelerant, because we didn't see it as (57:42) push either way"
253,"It's an important toolset to have to be consultative and transparent with our employers, and we continue to see good growth there"
254,"Yeah, Ana, to your macro point, it's been a little choppy ride in terms of narratives and obviously state level"
255,"there's 50 different narratives, 50 different dialogue points"
256,"First, stepping back, putting it back in context, historically, Cigna's not participated in, or focused on the under 50 employer segment"
257,Our Select segment is focused on the needs for the under 250 life employer segment historically and typically in the 50 to 250 segment
258,"There's a few states that actually moved that line from 50 to 100, and some modification to our approaches took place, but our growth hasn't been impacted"
259,"More broadly, to the core of your question, and from a state standpoint, as we interact at both the federal level and state level, we strongly believe that enablement of more choice versus restrictive regulation is critical, including in the small employer market"
260,"And enabling access to the innovative programs that are working more broadly in the employer market that have transparency, have the incentive, have the engagement capabilities are good for the employer, the customer and the health care professionals"
261,"And it varies by state, but we're seeing good understanding and acceptance of that; and very importantly, a lot of activation and support from the employer community itself wanting to amplify that dialogue"
262,"Because again it's their employees, their financing and their needs and they're seeing value there"
263,So a dynamic environment and it will continue to be and we'll stay engaged
264,"But for our Select segment, we see great growth opportunities looking forward"
265,"Perfectly summarized, Michael, yes"
266,"Michael, good morning"
267,So we actually strongly agree with that
268,"So the ability as we talk about to engage, incent and support Individual customers is critical to the way we think about our portfolio"
269,"I'll give you two illustrations, prior set, current set"
270,"Aiding our customers with highly transparent consumer friendly decision support tools around cost and quality, quite important to us"
271,We've continued to evolve those tools and capabilities
272,"We've been chosen by Consumer Reports and others as having the industry-leading tools relative to it, not just because of the data that's out there but the usability and the ability to influence decision-making"
273,So that's kind of past current state
274,"2017, important launch for us"
275,In the first quarter of 2017 we launched a new program and service that does exactly what you're describing
276,It's known as Cigna One Guide
277,"It's a multichannel, multi-modal engagement capability that allows the direction that you just articulated but also has a learning dimension that's built into it with smart algorithms to provide next-best decision support, next-best recommendations"
278,It also has the ability to integrate between the consumer or the individual with our service professionals and our clinical professionals
279,And we see the opportunity to integrate that further in our health care collaboratives going forward
280,So it's quite exciting
281,"By order of magnitude and scale, we're already servicing 1.5 million customers"
282,With that platform it'll rapidly ramp to over 5 million customers
283,So indicative of the journey we're on to the prior conversation relative to the customer NPS consumer centricity
284,"These are just two examples of investments in customer-oriented capabilities to better engage and support them; and very importantly where possible, integrate them with the health care professionals so there could be a similar level of insights going forward"
285,So expect to see more from us even on a go forward basis
286,"Thank you, everyone"
287,"So just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight a few key points from our discussion"
