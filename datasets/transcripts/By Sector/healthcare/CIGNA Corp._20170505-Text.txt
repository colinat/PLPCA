Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today
Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tom McCarthy for his many years of service with Cigna
As you know Tom announced his retirement this past February
Tom has not only been an instrumental leader within our organization for more than three decades with considerable accomplishments and contributions to our growth and success, he's also a good friend to many of us, and we'll miss him on a both personal and professional level
Tom's excited to start his next chapter and I know you'll join me in wishing him and Linda (3:51) all the best in his upcoming retirement
Also, Eric Palmer will be stepping into our CFO role the summer
Eric's a proven financially leader with a strong track record of accomplishments over his 20 years with our company, and I'm confident in the value he'll bring to the role
Eric's looking forward to discussions with you as we look ahead to Cigna's future and he'll be joining us for the Q&A portion of today's call
To begin this morning's call, I'll briefly highlight our strong financial results
I'll then discuss how our approach to engaging, incenting and supporting our customers and healthcare professionals, combined with our ongoing investments in innovative capabilities, continues to fuel our growth and drive differentiated value for our stakeholders
Tom will then address our first quarter financial results in more detail as well as provide more specifics for increased outlook for 2017 before we take your questions
And after Q&A I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks
I'll start with some highlights of our results
We started off 2017 with strong momentum in earnings growth across each of Cigna's business segments
For the first quarter of 2017, consolidated revenue increased 5% to more than $10 billion
We achieved 20% earnings growth with adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $719 million or $2.77 per share
Our Global Health Care business delivered earnings growth of 12% over the first quarter of 2016 with strong customer growth across all Commercial market segments, increased contributions from specialty solutions, well-managed medical costs and effective operating expense management
Revenue growth in our Commercial employer business continues to be very strong as we retain, expand and add new customer relationships across National Accounts, Middle Market, Select and our International market segments
In the Individual market, we continue to take a measured approach, participating where we can best deliver value and accumulate learnings as that very dynamic environment continues to evolve
And in our Seniors business, we expect be in position to participate in the Open Enrollment cycle this fall
In our Global Supplemental Benefits business Cigna again had double-digit revenue and earnings growth while continuing to make targeted investments to support future growth
Results from our Group Disability and Life business are benefiting from continued stable results in our Life portfolio and further improvements in our Disability performance
Overall, we began 2017 with strong momentum that we expect to carry through the remainder of the year and as such have increased our outlook for revenue, medical customer growth and EPS
Now I'd like to transition to how our ongoing value creation for you, our shareholders, goes hand-in-hand with improving the lives of our customers
As you know, we remain focused on enhancing access to affordable personalized quality care when and where health care services are consumed, all while we continue to expand peace of mind solutions for our customers around the world
We continue to innovate new ways to incentivize, engage and support both customers and providers of healthcare in a very localized manner, an approach which our experience shows helps to identify health risks earlier while also providing customers with greater value when they do need health services
Our proven approach begins with active listening to best understand and address the specific evolving needs of our customers and clients
This critical first step fuels our highly consultative solution oriented actions where we leverage our broad portfolio of programs and services and our collaborative relationships with healthcare professionals to deliver high-value, personalized solutions at a local level
We also actively engage customers and providers to facilitate the achievement of individual health goals and to strengthen incentive alignment particularly for our highest performing health care partners
Further, by leveraging data and insights we are better positioned to identify health risks at an earlier stage and take actions which allow us to improve the quality of health outcomes at a lower cost
As for scale and reach, our collaborative arrangements now total approximately 250 physician-based group arrangements
In addition to these partnerships we also have value-based arrangements in place with more than 125 hospital systems comprised of hundreds of individual hospitals spanning more than 30 states
We view our continued strength in Collaborative Accountable Care as paramount to accelerating the shared goals of increased value and sustainability across the healthcare system
Taken together with our innovative clinical programs and broad array of specialty health programs, we continue to deliver industry-leading medical cost trend which directly benefits our customers and clients and as such you, our shareholders
In addition to our proven partnerships with healthcare professionals, we are taking our alignment and collaborative approach to pharmaceutical companies
We have created seven such arrangements in the past two years that base reimbursement on the efficacy of the drug, not just the consumption or volume of the drug
Our leadership and innovation in the space was recently recognized by the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute with their excellence award in recognition of Cigna's strategic efforts to change the reimbursement model with drug manufacturers from volume to value as well as our use of outcome-based contracts which link financial terms to measured improvements in our customers health and our use of insights to inform future affordability strategies
These accomplishments represent a clear source of sustainable value creation for our business going forward, and as such, shareholder value creation
Our engagement with communities where we operate further complements our strategic growth initiatives and local focus
Because health is so highly personal and highly local, we believe that taking steps to demonstrably improve the health of the communities we serve is critical to creating a more sustainable healthcare system which in turn creates a better environment
We actively use our individual engagement tools to decrease the health risks in the communities we serve
These tools include differentiated partnerships as well as our information and insights and broad clinical programs
For example, we're working with communities to address the U.S
opioid addiction issue
We started in early 2016 by convening diverse leaders from public and private sectors and local communities across the U.S
to LA and from Chicago to Houston
And with these leaders we are taking action to stem addiction before it starts as well as address the needs for those who are addicted
Additionally Cigna is committed to reducing our customers' opioid use by 25% by 2019 to take us back to pre-crisis levels, while still providing the right care at the right time for our customers
To date, more than 150 forward-looking physician groups with nearly 62,000 physicians have signed on to actively honor our shared pledge, which is driving meaningful improvement already
For example, to-date, we've already delivered a 12% reduction in our customers use of opioid pharmaceuticals
Another example of our focus on communities is the Cigna Health Improvement Tour, a multi-city tour bringing free health screening and health coaching to communities nationwide so people can learn their numbers for four key indicators of chronic health concerns including blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and BMI
To date, our tour has visited 18 cities and has had interactions with thousands of people
Our approach to partnering with our communities is another pathway towards creating greater access to more affordable, personalized and a more sustainable healthcare system
Now as I noted earlier, creating differentiated value for our clients and customers also enables us to deliver differentiated value for you, our shareholders
A part of that value is underscored in our exceptionally strong capital position and strategic financial flexibility at Cigna
We continue to expect to have over $5 billion of deployable capital at the parent company level in 2017, a testament to the strength and capital efficiency of our operating businesses
Given our under-levered balance sheet, as previous discussed, we also expect a significant increased degree of capital deployment capacity by returning to more normalized leverage ratios
Consistent with our prior comments, depending on the mix of share repurchase, dividend and M&A, we continue to expect capital deployment capacity of $7 billion to $14 billion in 2017. We remain very well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder value over the long-term through a combination of strong organic revenue earnings growth and effective capital deployment
I'll now briefly touch upon the status of our proposed combination with Anthem
As you saw last week, the U.S
Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court enjoining the merger
This morning Anthem announced that it has filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court seeking a review of the decision by the Court of Appeals
On May 8, there will be a hearing in the Delaware Chancery Court to determine Cigna's rights to terminate the merger agreement
We will update you when there is additional news to share
Now before I hand the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate a few key points
The momentum we closed 2016 with has continued into 2017. We've started the year with strong results highlighted by double-digit earnings growth and strength in each of our operating business segments
This performance gives us added confidence that we will achieve our increased 2017 earnings outlook which is now a growth rate of 15% to 20% versus 2016. We're continuing to deliver value with an emphasis on personalization, affordability and being the partner of choice
Over the last couple of years we've positioned ourselves through ongoing investments in innovative capabilities and programs
We are positioned with outstanding capital strength, and as a global health service company we are creating significant value for all of our stakeholders thanks to the passion and dedication of our Cigna colleagues around the world
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom
Kevin, good morning; it's David
First, just at a macro level, we're quite pleased with the start of year, and just putting it into context, we set a pretty meaningful earnings growth goal for the organization for 2017 in the 12% to 18% range and we're quite pleased to start with this strength and raise that outlook to a 15% to 20% range
It's early in the year
We feel really good about the fundamentals from the revenue to the customer life growth, to the foundational aspects within the business, and look forward to a very good year
There's nothing beyond other than a strong start to the year, we feel quite good about raising the outlook, and it's early in the year, hence we think the raise is appropriate and for an (26:24) appropriate range
Kevin, I'll just frame it and ask Eric to give you a little bit relative to the way our medical costs more broadly are unfolding
First off, to put it back in context, we're starting the year again quite positive
The -- put it back into context, 2016 we delivered another very strong year of below 4% medical cost trend
We set an expectation for ourself for this year of 4.5% to 5.5%, and we're performing well within those -- the construct
We typically don't break out the prior year development by micro line of business
Eric can give you a little bit direction there and then the little bit of color relative to just the core medical cost trend we're seeing within the business by some of the categories
First, broadly relative to the PBM, our view relative to the services we need to deliver is that the broad-based pharmacy capabilities are one of the most critical capabilities to have an overall effective health service offering
To put your question back into context and be clear, today we own and fully operate our PBM and continue to
We partner where appropriate, and work to actively integrate our capabilities, and we're quite pleased with the outcomes we're delivering for the benefit of our customers, the service, the clinical quality
Eric just made reference to the sustained medical cost trend in the mid-single digit range, great value for our employer clients
And importantly, our approach to the integrated PBM presents even a further opportunity to integrate the information, the clinical program, the gap in care closure with our health care professionals
So own and operate, partner where appropriate, it's performing well and we're pleased
Lastly, in addition to the trend, I would note we've continued to successfully grow our PBM covered lives of our customer base pretty meaningfully and I think that's also a testament to the value we're delivering
So performing very well for us
Well, first and foremost, as we stepped into this process early on and we've set an extremely aggressive push for our organization to attempt to get all of the issues resolved before the prior year's Open Enrollment process, acknowledging that it was an extraordinary, at least short timeframe based on historical standards
Once that window eclipsed we set our sights toward, obviously, fully finishing the remediation work, which we're at the final aspects of
Point two is ensuring that we position ourselves to come out of this phase with an even stronger business unit, operating platform, and team and we're literally in the latter chapters of the body of work, ongoing dialogue, interaction with CMS as we speak
Lastly, just to reinforce, we're pleased with, while we don't like to shrink, we're pleased with the fact that our retention rates held up quite strongly through this process and I think that's a further validation and testament to the strength of the physician partnerships and collaboratives, with 85% of all of our MA lives in collaboratives and our very strong HealthSpring team that wakes up every day to serve our customers
So we're in the final chapter
We're having ongoing interaction and dialogue with CMS and we're planning for, in all aspects, to be in the fall enrollment cycle
Yeah, it's David
Thank you for the question
First and foremost, we're quite pleased with our customer growth coming into the year
We've set an objective for ourselves to grow in the 300,000 to 500,000 range and we're able to increase that outlook
First, broadly speaking, we've seen strong retention results, good new business adds and good expansion of relationships across all of our Commercial business segment
So quite important
Specific to the U.S
National Accounts, and as you know we define National Accounts as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state
The employment base in that market has more stabilized now versus the continued 2% or so attrition, broadly speaking, as you look at the marketplace
We've had a great selling season coming into 2017, outstanding retention, good expansion, and good new business adds
I would add to the notion of our approach, that consultative approach is working quite well here in our National Account team, both our sales team, our client management team, aided by our informatics experts and our clinicians who've just done an outstanding job
Those employers are benefiting by our superior medical cost trend and it's working quite well in the market
The only add I would give you, A
, is that we did see some further contributions to the National Account number off of some private exchange growth, as well, which is additive to this
I would say it's complementary but the foundation performed quite well
And then in our target go-deep markets and geographies, we saw some good growth on private exchange as well
So net-net, a strong Commercial performance
, a bunch of questions there
Let me try to frame the environment as we see it
First, as you know, we've taken a very measured approach since the inception of the exchanges to this marketplace
We've been in a range of five to seven states and 2% to 4% of our enterprise revenue in these programs
We still have to engage here to learn and to evolve the programs we've put in place
And we've seen some successful recipes by using our highly performing collaborative models
Specific to your question, our growth is about where we expected it to be
The locations of our growth, the aggregate growth and our performance in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be as well
Relative to 2018, while it's already late in the cycle, unfortunately it's too early to declare because as you know, the evolving rules, regs and positioning coming out of Washington is still pretty dynamic and we're tracking it day-to-day and working with the federal government
So growth in line with our expectations
First quarter performance in line with our expectations
Highly focused in seven states today and highly focused through our collaborative relationships
Stay tuned for more relative to 2018 as the final fact set closes relative to the regulatory environment
Ralph, just framing it from a broad standpoint, our sales and client management team, supported by our underwriters, informatics and clinical team; we attempt to approach the market in terms of a solution orientation
So understanding the clients' needs; understanding their health burden; understanding their culture and strategy; understanding their readiness to change; recommend a series of programs: service, design, et cetera; and then engage with them on funding approach with a pretty agnostic orientation relative to ASO, ASO stop-loss experience-rated guaranteed cost
And that's one of our strengths
And you'll see ebbs and flows over time
Now we had good growth in all of our customer segments for 2017 thus far and good growth in all of our funding mechanisms
I wouldn't call out anything unique relative to experience-rated there
It's a part of our franchise that we've used over quite some time; and typically, that hunts well in the middle market
Lastly as I said to a prior call, we saw a little bit more uptick in the private exchange lives
They were split about 50-50; you could think about that between ASO and guaranteed cost on the National Account franchise
So, again, nothing to call out other than strong growth and leveraging the broad portfolio of funding mechanisms we have
Ralph, on the long-term we're looking forward
As we've discussed in the past, one of our M&A capital deployment priorities is to seek opportunities to expand, as we say our capabilities to serve Government-based high-risk programs over time
We believe the marketplace will continue to evolve to use more actively managed and collaborative-oriented programs relative to both state and federal programs that serve the higher-risk population
And over time, we see opportunities in a more localized manner to pursue those as we look to the future
Justin, it's David
Good morning
First and foremost, we're pleased with the performance
We saw a step up in Q3 of last year, Q4 we see strong performance in the first quarter this year with stable ongoing results on the Life side
The Disability results were a little stronger in the first quarter than even we had anticipated which is good
And we're pleased to take up the outlook for that line of business
As we look forward to the core of your question, we remain fully focused on completing all the bodies of work that are in front of us relative to stabilizing that business
And our expressed objective is that we step out of 2017 with the full strength of that organization as we look to 2018. That's our objective, and we're well on our way relative to that goal
Justin, relative to Monday's court review and decision, not helpful for us to speculate on the outcome or the timing of that
Clearly, we'll be in position to communicate as quickly as possible, and recognize the importance relative to that, but not helpful for us to speculate on the timing or the outcome there, but it's on the immediate horizon
To the core of your question, we would challenge ourself once there's open clarity to be as comprehensive and timely as possible for our shareholders to communicate next steps for our organization
And I would think you'd have confidence that we've always been both transparent and responsive and we would seek to be highly transparent and responsive as soon as the window opens to have that conversation
The way we would frame it, I'm not sure how you're applying the net gross et cetera
We would view that as the net number that our clients and customers experience and noting that the vast majority of our business is self-funded
That's the net number of what they're seeing
And of course, you used the term buy downs
Evolution of the benefit programs is obvious factored in and contemplated within that
Gary, David
Not helpful to try to put a pin point number on that
Most important piece, we remain fully focused, aligned and prepared for the Open Enrollment process for the fall cycle
Beyond that not helpful to expand further
Gary, it's David
First I compliment the efficiency of getting four questions in
Well done on your part
Specific to Monday, we're not going to expand further in terms of speculating the outcome relative to the court
We leave it to the courts to draw the conclusion, and we will communicate this immediately as quickly as possible after there's clarity in terms of next steps
Chris, it's David
As I indicated to a prior question relative to the outlook, first off, macro – we set a pretty meaningful increase relative to the franchise performance for 2017 as we stepped into the year
We're pleased to actually have such a strong quarter and be able to raise our outlook
There is nothing unique to call out
It's just early in the year, a variety of moving parts, and we look forward to continuing to deliver strength as we look forward
But there's nothing unique to call out relative to moving items within the Global Health Care business
Our organization's orientation is going to be as soon as sanctions are lifted, we're ready to roll
The team is anxious to get back into the marketplace
It's a very capable, prideful, passionate team that have the deep position partnerships, and everybody's ready to move as soon we're given the green light relative to CMS's conclusion
So if that happens prior to the Open Enrollment cycle, there'll be activation in the current year, et cetera
Peter, let me try to package the framework of your questions together and try to be responsive to all the items you raised
First and foremost, stepping back, most important headline, we're pleased with our outlook
Remember, we've set an expectation for ourselves to grow 300,000 to 500,000 lives, so we expect it to grow across our business
We had expectations to grow the Individual business
We had expectation to grow the Commercial business
We understood we would strengthen the Seniors business
That was contemplated within that
Within all of our businesses, we're essentially in line with expectations save for a little bit more strength in the National Accounts and a little bit more strength in the regional markets
So headline, we expect it to grow
We've grown across all of our funding mechanisms, and by line of business or by segment, in line with expectations with a bit more strength in National Accounts, which is great, as well as the regional segment
Point two, you identified a bunch of risks
I maybe go to the end of your question and work my way back
As I discussed before, our approach has been for quite some time not to be in a position to sell products but rather to try to put in place a framework of solutions
So having the capabilities to do so is one thing, having the talent to do so is another thing, and having the information and infrastructure to support that is another thing
While our organization is far from perfect, we're sitting on a decade of investments to be able to deliver that, and our really talented team is able to be consultative in support of our clients and customers in the marketplace today and move the levers that best match those clients' needs relative to benefit design, engagement, incentive, network design, collaborative leverage, and then get the right funding mechanism in place
And the proof is in the pudding in terms of multiple years of lowest industry medical cost trend, last year below 4%
Targeted 4.5% to 5.5% for this your, performing in line with those expectations and moving forward
Now to try to come back to the core of your question, if you had to pin us down in terms of what would be the number one variable that sits in front of us right now, you still have to come back to the Individual market just because as an industry there's variability relative to that
I would remind you it remains less than 5% of overall revenue for our organization
We're focused in seven states
We exited three states coming into 2017 where we couldn't get the recipe we wanted in place, and the vast majority of what we're doing right now are aligned to the physician collaboratives and we performed, generally speaking, in line with our expectations for the first quarter
But there would be more variability in that than our other lines of business just because of the nature of that animal
But we're off to a start with the number of lives, the location of the lives, and the performance of those lives year-to-date, already
Well, Dave, remember first and foremost, if you take National Accounts, think about that marketplace as traditionally largely self-funded
So let's go back to the base frame
Outstanding retention year, so clients who are experiencing the service value proposition medical cost trend, et cetera, are pleased, therefore, staying with us
We could either drive innovation, changes, et cetera, but it starts with really strong retention
Second is earning the right to expand relationships with our existing corporate clients, either through adding new geographies for medical or further expanding the specialty solutions which is a cornerstone of our strategy, and then targeted new business adds
As I noted earlier, we've also been able to perform on some of the private exchanges
There we orient relative to our very targeted go-deep orientation on key geographies where we believe we have a differentiated value proposition from collaboratives or otherwise and target some opportunities there
So we feel quite good about the quality of the business that's been put in the books
Important to underscore though, this all starts with an outstanding retention result
Outstanding retention in National, regional and Select then further expansion, then targeted adds
Sarah, good morning, it's David
We obviously, we've always talked about our growth strategy being oriented around retain, expand, add, because again you have to deliver on your promise relative to your existing clients and customers to earn the right, first off, to keep the relationships, ideally to expand the relationships on the targeted basis, and then new business adds
We talk within our corporation around a culture and an environment of customer centricity, putting the customer in the center of all we do
I forget how many years ago it was
We started measuring Net Promoter Score on a global basis multiple years ago, feels like five years ago or so
We have it built into the incentive structure of the organization for everybody in the organization from me on down to anybody who's in a variable reward structure
And we think it's an important part
It's not the singular part, but it's an important part of understanding both relational NPS, that's the aggregate relationship, the loyalty factor et cetera
But then you have the ability to get really pinpointed as well in terms of transactional NPS
It helps you actually guide your business during the course of the year as opposed to waiting for the longer-tailed relational
So you want to look at both of those pieces of the equation
And lastly to further expand this, we carry that orientation beyond our customers to our clients and our key health care professional partners as well
Understanding that orientation of beyond satisfaction, loyalty effect, and where dissatisfiers are versus satisfiers and continuing your innovative evolution around that is mission-critical
So we've been committed to this for a long period of time, and it's one of the mechanisms we use around our customer-centricity focus
Sarah, I would think about it intermediate to long term
This is not a 12-month horizon item for us currently
Ana, a big picture, no is the answer
We don't see any disruption relative to that
So, yes, we expect the growth rate to sustain going-forward
And as you step back from it, having the – our belief that is then having the transparent funding mechanisms to better align ourselves with the employers, enables us to have daily, weekly, monthly interaction with the employers as opposed to an annual interaction relative to the performance
And then dynamically manage, engage in how the programs are operating
For the smaller side of the employer space, as you move down beyond National into the lower end of Middle Market and into Select, the stop-loss component adds a measure of certainty and predictably for the employers and it augments
We never viewed that the prior law with the tax was an accelerant
We don't view that the current proposed changes will be a decelerant, because we didn't see it as (57:42) push either way
It's an important toolset to have to be consultative and transparent with our employers, and we continue to see good growth there
Yeah, Ana, to your macro point, it's been a little choppy ride in terms of narratives and obviously state level there's 50 different narratives, 50 different dialogue points
First, stepping back, putting it back in context, historically, Cigna's not participated in, or focused on the under 50 employer segment
Our Select segment is focused on the needs for the under 250 life employer segment historically and typically in the 50 to 250 segment
There's a few states that actually moved that line from 50 to 100, and some modification to our approaches took place, but our growth hasn't been impacted
More broadly, to the core of your question, and from a state standpoint, as we interact at both the federal level and state level, we strongly believe that enablement of more choice versus restrictive regulation is critical, including in the small employer market
And enabling access to the innovative programs that are working more broadly in the employer market that have transparency, have the incentive, have the engagement capabilities are good for the employer, the customer and the health care professionals
And it varies by state, but we're seeing good understanding and acceptance of that; and very importantly, a lot of activation and support from the employer community itself wanting to amplify that dialogue
Because again it's their employees, their financing and their needs and they're seeing value there
So a dynamic environment and it will continue to be and we'll stay engaged
But for our Select segment, we see great growth opportunities looking forward
Perfectly summarized, Michael, yes
Michael, good morning
So we actually strongly agree with that
So the ability as we talk about to engage, incent and support Individual customers is critical to the way we think about our portfolio
I'll give you two illustrations, prior set, current set
Aiding our customers with highly transparent consumer friendly decision support tools around cost and quality, quite important to us
We've continued to evolve those tools and capabilities
We've been chosen by Consumer Reports and others as having the industry-leading tools relative to it, not just because of the data that's out there but the usability and the ability to influence decision-making
So that's kind of past current state
2017, important launch for us
In the first quarter of 2017 we launched a new program and service that does exactly what you're describing
It's known as Cigna One Guide
It's a multichannel, multi-modal engagement capability that allows the direction that you just articulated but also has a learning dimension that's built into it with smart algorithms to provide next-best decision support, next-best recommendations
It also has the ability to integrate between the consumer or the individual with our service professionals and our clinical professionals
And we see the opportunity to integrate that further in our health care collaboratives going forward
So it's quite exciting
By order of magnitude and scale, we're already servicing 1.5 million customers
With that platform it'll rapidly ramp to over 5 million customers
So indicative of the journey we're on to the prior conversation relative to the customer NPS consumer centricity
These are just two examples of investments in customer-oriented capabilities to better engage and support them; and very importantly where possible, integrate them with the health care professionals so there could be a similar level of insights going forward
So expect to see more from us even on a go forward basis
Thank you, everyone
So just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight a few key points from our discussion
We began 2017 with strong momentum and have increased our outlook for the full year
We reported strong revenue growth with earnings growth across each of our business segments and strong customer growth
We remain committed to achieving our long-term average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 13%
We're confident in our ability to deliver our increased 2017 outlook of 15% to 20% earnings growth, and we're further strengthened by our significant capital position and our capacity for meaningful capital deployment
Our efforts to improve the health and lives of our customers in the communities we work and live in and play in around the world are driven daily by the talented and dedicated Cigna team
And lastly, we thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to our future conversations
