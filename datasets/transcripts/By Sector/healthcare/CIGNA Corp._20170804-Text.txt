Thanks, Will
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today
I'll begin my comments by highlighting Cigna's second quarter operating results, which reflect strong execution and continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses
Then I'll describe how our recently evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond guides our focus on the multiple avenues we have for attractive long-term growth
As part of our discussion, I'll highlight some of the examples of growth opportunities we are pursuing across our global markets
I'll then turn the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our second quarter results as well as our increased outlook for full year 2017. And then following our Q&A, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing comments
I'll start with this quarter's operating results
In the second quarter, we continued our momentum with organic earnings growth in all of our reporting segments
Consolidated revenue increased to $10.3 billion
And we grew earnings to $750 million, or $2.91 per share, with significantly increased bottom line contributions from each of our businesses
Turning to the segments, in Global Health Care, we posted another quarter of strong earnings growth, and our unique approach to engagement and incentive alignment continues to generate high-quality clinical outcomes and competitively differentiated medical costs
Our Global Supplemental Benefits business had another outstanding quarter, and we continue to innovate with solutions and distribution approaches that enable us to address the evolving health and sense of security needs of individuals in our targeted geographies around the world
And our Group Disability and Life business delivered strong results, specifically in disability, where our clinical resources and productivity model continues to generate improved return-to-work results, which benefit our customers and our employer clients
Collectively, these results coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 EPS outlook of $9.75 to $10.05 per share
As we discussed at our Investor Day in June, to further accelerate our strategic journey as a global health service company, we've taken our successful Go strategy to the next level, building on our differentiated results over the past seven-plus years, a timeframe where we delivered 11% compounded annual growth rate for revenue, 12% for EPS, and an average annual TSR of 34%
Our evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we will deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers
The Go Deeper and Go Local dimensions of our strategy will drive opportunities for Cigna to capture meaningful growth in our targeted businesses and guide us to expand our capabilities and pursue targeted additional adjacencies
Today I'll highlight four areas where we see significant headroom opportunities for growth
I'll briefly touch upon employer clients with up to 500 employees, our voluntary solutions, Medicare Advantage, and our international markets
Beginning with employer clients with up to 500 employees, increasingly we see these employers are eager to benefit from proven market innovations, including greater choice of transparent affordable solutions to help enable a more productive workforce
They're also seeking health engagement capabilities such as onsite biometric screening, health coaching, and innovative clinical programs
Cigna is uniquely positioned to expand and add to these relationships
Our consultative approach, our investments to expand our capabilities, and our flexible and innovative offerings such as One Guide are very responsive to the emerging needs of these clients
Next, we also see significant growth potential for our differentiated portfolio of voluntary solutions, as individuals are increasingly empowered to make more personalized choices through their employers relative to their specific benefits that best meet their personal needs at a given life or health stage
We view the $8 billion group supplemental market and specifically accident indemnity, critical illness, and hospital care as complementary to our medical and disability offerings, and as such a large growth opportunity for us
Today we are well positioned with a range of distribution, products, and consumer insight capabilities
In addition, we have proven capabilities in the supplemental market through our successful Global Supplemental Benefits business across the globe
Next, relative to Medicare Advantage, there is an increasing understanding and appreciation for the ability of these programs to meet the health and wellness needs of the rapidly growing seniors population in the U.S
We deliver significant value to seniors through deep physician partnerships and coordinated approaches to care, each of which are aided by our proven approach to incentive alignment
When you combine this with the effectiveness of Cigna's HealthSpring differentiated value proposition, which is a deeply rooted value-based care series of programs, we see the U.S
seniors marketplace as a tremendous growth opportunity, both in our existing as well as new markets
As a final example, we see meaningful growth opportunities in our targeted international markets
The global health marketplace is large, complex, and changing rapidly, which provides us with potential for attractive growth and ongoing value creation
In each of our international businesses, specifically Global Supplemental Benefits and Global Health Benefits, Cigna brings decades of local experience and expertise in delivering health, well-being, and sense of security solutions to both individual customers and employer clients
I'll begin with comments on our Global Supplemental Benefits business
We see considerable opportunities for continued growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, where today we serve approximately 13 million customer relationships and where we have grown revenue at a compounded annual rate of 18% since 2009. In terms of market opportunities, the middle class in Asia alone is expected to continue to grow by 9% annually through 2030, with even higher growth rates anticipated in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia, where we already have a strong foothold
We recognize that innovative distribution is critical to meeting the diverse and emerging needs of this population
For example, over the past several years, we have broadened our distribution channels from what was primarily outbound telemarketing to new capabilities such as direct-to-consumer channels, including direct-response TV, online, and face-to-face sales, particularly in branches of local banking partners
Further driving demand, medical costs are outpacing inflation globally, meaning health protection gaps will continue to rise
The health coverage gap across the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow to $200 billion by the year 2020, and Cigna is well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the needs of individuals most impacted by this gap
Relative to global health benefits, Cigna is the leading provider of health benefits to the globally mobile population today, with a range of solutions for medical, dental, and pharmacy to behavioral, life and long-term disability benefits
We're deepening our solution suite to offer clients an even more flexible range of benefits that can be customized to meet the complex needs of the globally mobile population
We're further driving growth by expanding our global medical and healthcare provider networks and investing in care management and coordination capabilities which leverage global best practices
Taking all of this into consideration, Cigna is well positioned to capture further headroom in our existing international businesses as well as expand our capabilities through continued product, service, and distribution innovation
Before I close my remarks, I'd also note how closely tied to our Go Deep and Go Local proposition is our Go Beyond proposition, which further differentiates the services, capabilities, and experiences we deliver as well as our social impact
I'll share two brief examples, the first being our early adoption Net Promoter Score, or NPS, to improve the customer experience, and the second being our commitment to making an even greater social impact for our local communities around the world, where as we know, social programs designed to promote health and well-being too often leave gaps for local communities
Approximately five years ago, we were the first in our industry to see Net Promoter Score as a more effective way to understand the loyalty and emerging needs of customers and to drive targeted service and program innovations from those insights
Examples of our innovations include One Guide in the United States, which is already serving nearly 2 million customers, as well as our recently introduced global Wellbeing app, which will be available to customers across the globe
Further ongoing emphasis on community involvement guides Cigna's actions, such as stepping up to the void in the United States relative to the opioid epidemic
Here, we are already seeing meaningful progress toward our goal to reduce the use of opioid pharmaceuticals amongst our customers by 25%
And we are serving as a convening force across the country for community, faith, law enforcement, and healthcare leaders
We're also deepening our work for the benefit of the veteran community, and we are furthering a range of community-based initiatives to help seniors in key geographies across the world
Taken together, our strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond will drive additional value creation for our customers, our clients, physician partners, and communities, and as a result for our shareholders
Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric
Cigna delivered strong second quarter results, with considerable strength across our portfolio of businesses, as we delivered organic earnings growth in each of our reporting segments
Our increased EPS range of $9.75 to $10.05 per share represents a growth rate of 20% to 24% over our 2016 results
Our strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to our actions in order to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients
We do this by achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we seek to deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers
In particular, the Go Deeper and Go Local dimensions of our strategy will drive opportunities for Cigna to deliver significant growth in each of our targeted businesses
And our performance momentum through the second quarter of 2017 coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric
As you said, it's early for 2018 guidance, so we're not going through the individual components
Let me try to give you just a little color relative to that, all taken against the backdrop, as you said, at our Investor Day, we remain committed to the 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth rate and our strategic objectives to achieve the $16 of EPS out in 2021. First, as you think about starting any given year, so as we talk about 2018, I would remind you that we always start a year and plan for a year assuming that there will be no prior-year reserve development
So put that back in context, as you know, we have a lot of – $100 million after tax of prior-year reserve development in 2017. So we would start viewing that as a zero going into 2018. The macro headlines I'd ask you to think about off of that is very strong momentum off of the core business in 2017, which really is important when you're projecting forward
To be clear, we would expect to grow revenue as well as earnings off of our 2017 base
As noted by Eric, we have a great track record of producing very strong cash flows
We expect that to continue in 2018 as well as to maintain a very strong capital position
So we look forward to carrying the momentum out of 2017 into 2018 with good top line and bottom line growth, noting that the prior-year reserve development would be something we would always plan for and project at zero
Ralph, to expand on the long-term outlook, clearly this business has, is, and will continue to grow at an organic rate faster than other aspects of our business
We feel great about the overall portfolio of businesses
This has a faster and more robust underlying growth rate
As such, if we were just to simply freeze for any M&A across the franchise, to your point, the percent of revenue to the enterprise, percent of earnings to the enterprise would continue to grow for this business as we look forward
And important to note, as we've discussed in the past, we continue to invest in and expand in capabilities, geographic footprint, talent, et cetera, to continue that growth momentum, so we have good optimism here to see it be a bigger part of the portfolio going forward
, on the macro perspective, I think you make some very good observations, and specifically I'd highlight a few points
First, broadly speaking, I think when the industry is having this conversation and to the core of your question, it's really driven broadly speaking by the employer marketplace
And the good news is as you look over the last several years, the employer marketplace, while always has opportunities for improvement, has driven meaningful step-up in innovation
So where does the innovation come from? Improved incentive alignment
Where does the innovation come from? Evolution of clinical programs
Where is the innovation coming from? Beginning to explore across the industry more value-based programs, as have been proven in MA
Specific to Cigna, we've been deep into those areas for quite some time
And to the cornerstone of your comment, we're seeing a little bit bigger impact of those results on a sustainable basis
I'd also note finally, as we've discussed in the past, there's more adoption of transparent funding programs
That creates better alignment with employers
That helps to create better alignment with individuals, all of which help you get better engagement and better clinical outcomes
So net-net, we see it as a societal good to see this from an industry standpoint, and we're pleased from a Cigna standpoint our results are leading the pack relative to those engagement incentive-based outcomes
So first, we're quite pleased to come out of the sanctions process well in advance of the 2018 open enrollment cycle
Our team as we sit here today is actively enrolling for the remaining 2017 months and is highly focused and well prepared for a very successful open enrollment cycle this fall
And for 2018, I would just say very clearly, we expect to grow our MA portfolio
And I'd remind you that as you think about our proposition, we have a clear track record of consistent sustainable growth in our MA portfolio, which always starts with strong customer retention, and we're aided by those strong customer retention levels because of the fact that we have a high value-based penetration of our programs
85% of all of our MA lives are in value-based programs
So to be really clear, we're active today
In the remaining 2017 months, the team is prepared and ready to roll for 2018, and we expect to grow
Good morning
Let me give you a little bit of insight relative to the 2018 season
So I'll start with some color relative to the national account market, which is the most tangible market to speak to right now, given that it has a little bit broader selling cycle, and then give you a little bit of insight relative to your question on the HIF
First, relative to national accounts, I'd remind you that we define that segment a little differently than the industry
Specifically, when we refer to national, it's commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees in multiple states
Secondly, I'd just remind you our strategic goal has been to hold share from an aggregate standpoint but to deepen share with employers who value incentive and engagement-based programs, and then further deepen our relationship with our clients through leveraging our specialty and clinical programs
And I would note that 2017 has been a good year for that business segment
As it relates to 2018, what we've seen is that the RFP process, so the inbound opportunities for new growth opportunities, are up relative to 2016 meaningfully
I'd note that the 2016 volumes were low for the industry because there was a lot of industry disruption
But the 2018 volumes look a little bit more like 2016, and they're up meaningfully
To put that in context, the percent of our business that's out to bid is up a little bit, but nowhere near as meaningfully as the inbound opportunities
And we would expect as we look at 2018 to continue to have a very strong client retention rate
As it relates to broader purchasing trends, building on the prior comments, we continue to see across all segments high interest levels in incentive and engagement-based programs, which tend to leverage the transparent funding programs because they just create greater alignment with the employer, and as such, the individual customer employee, and enable you to get better mentally incentive alignment by targeted clinical programs, and we see that trend continuing
Lastly, as it relates to the HIF, the industry has a mechanism with which to previously pull out the pricing impact of the HIF and now put the pricing impact of the HIF back in
And we do not see a demonstrable change in purchasing patterns as it relates to guaranteed cost or transparent funding program as a result of that
Again, just putting it in context, we've seen a continued drumbeat of broader adoption of transparent funding programs across the marketplace, but we don't see that trend of acceleration changing
As I think you know, that's currently in active litigation, and we don't typically comment on active litigation
So I'd like to leave it there
I'll ask Eric to expand on that, but the tax gain is more broadly speaking relative to sun-setting the integration activity
Good morning, Scott
First, just broadly speaking relative to investments, we have a long track record of a continued process of investing back into our portfolio of businesses, whether it be the healthcare business from a commercial standpoint, innovations like One Guide, whether it's the global business innovations like the global Wellbeing app, whether it's voluntary expansion within our group and our Health Care portfolio as well as MA
So broadly speaking, we just have a continued investment orientation within the portfolio
As it relates to MA, as I noted before, we would expect to grow our MA portfolio in 2018 organically
To be very clear, we did not expand geographically for 2018 because of the previous situation we were in
We would expect to resume our proven pattern of expanding geographies, both adjacent counties as well as new geographies as we look to 2019 and beyond, and we'll be updating you on those investments as we go forward
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay, thank you
Kevin, it's David
They were not in order of importance
We have a well-positioned portfolio of businesses with a number of growth opportunities
And those specific four growth opportunities we spent some time at our Investor Day and further embellishing on them, so we see step-function growth in those four categories
And again, you'll note the diversity of our portfolio enables us to have several unique growth opportunities that we're quite excited about
It's David
I think we always start with our growth mantra for our corporation across the globe is retain-expand-add
So we start with the fundamental proposition that if you're delivering strong value to your customers, you should expect the ability to retain relationships at an elevated level
For the aspects of our business that we have the ability to expand the relationship through our specialty portfolio, et cetera, if we're delivering strong value and retaining on a targeted basis, we should be able to identify ways to further expand the value for our customers and clients and therefore expand relationships and targeted adds
As it relates to MA, that's really retention, in addition, with the process, so I would start with the notion of even during the sanction process, we were able to post a retention rate that was higher than others that have gone through the similar process
And I think that points back to, number one, the deep well-rooted physician partnership models and value-based relationships and strong service delivery, so that's the core
Two, to answer your question, we're selling in the marketplace right now and we're re-enrolling
And the pattern is evolving, so we're back in the market for July 1. We're able to test and see whether or not the momentum was manifesting itself, and we're in the market for August 1. We're able to manifest itself and we'll be in the market through the residual months of 2017. Secondly, we do know from some of our very well-developed physician engagement models, there's some high energy in those markets and with seniors coming into our program
So we would expect to step into 2018 with net growth across this portfolio, and we don't believe we need a hiatus to re-manifest our growth objectives
It's David
Just again, to put the levers back in context, as Eric noted in his prepared remarks, our capital deployment priorities remain and are very clear: so support the ongoing needs of our growing businesses, and our growing businesses are supported by well-capitalized subsidiaries today; second, strategic and appropriately attractive M&A; and third is share repurchase as a primary means of returning to our shareholders as we sit here today
As we've spent a good time on, we have meaningful capital deployment opportunities in front of us relative to current cash on hand as well as leverage capability, and that's both an exciting opportunity but a meaningful shareholder responsibility that we understand
I would note that there's not an or proposition
It's not like we have a date certain that we're going to shift from A to B
It's a dynamic portfolio management process, and I would guide you to just reflect back on over our last half a dozen-plus years
We have a proven track record of: A), not letting excess cash or capital sit idle for the benefit of shareholders; B), a very disciplined approach when we do engage in M&A online with our articulated M&A objectives; and over time a very balanced approach relative to M&A as well as share repurchase
In fact, if you look back over the last half a dozen-plus years, it's about 50:50. To your point, it just happened in a little bit more lumpy fashion because of when the M&A opportunities present themselves
So net-net taken as a whole, significant shareholder value creation sits in front us relative to capital deployment, and we get that
Ana, good morning
It's David
You bridged two points
The value-based care component, so alignment with healthcare professionals to pay based on the quality of outcomes and the coordination of care, I would ask you to think about it two ways
One, very deep and broad relative to MA, 85% of all of our MA lives are in a value-based care program, deepening and evolving in the commercial space
So upside opportunities we look forward in the commercial space for sure
The reason why I reference that is in addition to that in the commercial space, what we've been able to do is advance significantly more on the demand side of the process, so individual incentive alignment, individual engagement, care coordination, navigation support, incentive alignment
When you take all those and put them together, as Eric noted, our commercial medical cost trend continues to track very favorably relative to any industry norm and continues to track favorably relative to our expectations in this year
Now to the clients, I'd remind you that 85% of our employer clients are in self-funded and fully transparent relationships
We like that because there's high levels of alignment, transparency, and visibility month to month, quarter to quarter, year to year, and they're seeing the benefit of this lower medical cost trend for their respective portfolio based upon the actions we're driving and continuing to drive for them
And of the residual 15%, that's split amongst experience-rated relationships where there's high transparency as well as guaranteed cost
And in guaranteed cost, if we isolate the 4% or so of our revenue that's on the individual exchange-based business because we don't play down-market under 50 employees, even those employers tend to be rated based on the credibility of their experience
My point is there's a high level of transparency and alignment with employers, and therefore we're aligned to try to get the right clinical programs moving forward, and we'll continue to drive this approach in 2018 and beyond
Ana, it's David
I'm not sure I can give you a point estimate to build into your growth forecast
I'd bring you back a little bit to the time we spent on this topic at I
Day walking through some dimensions of the respective penetration levels that exist, and some headroom exists across our portfolio
So point one is we have headroom or additional penetration and growth opportunities across our portfolio
We don't view that as a static result because the dynamics of our employers' needs evolve
Secondly, as we've proven, we continue to innovate new programs and new services for the benefit of our clients, so we don't manage a static book
And thirdly, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we see the evolving employer voluntary marketplace as an additional growth opportunity
So as we talk about the retain-expand-add, the expand aspect of our growth strategy continues to have a lot of upside attractiveness both based on our existing specialty portfolio as well as evolved capabilities as we look forward
Sure, good morning
I appreciate the question very much
An important part of having a business that has disruption, how do you engage your team and keep them engaged, et cetera? So very importantly, we understood that coming into the sanction process, and my hat is off to our Medicare leadership team
They did a great job of having massive transparency with our colleagues across all aspects of the business, including sales, to your point
Too, our retention rates have been outstanding
We smartly redeployed a lot of the sales folks and growth-related folks in other aspects of the business
And I think we actually have a net benefit from that, if you look at the silver lining in the clouds, where skill sets and experiences have evolved because they've worked in other aspects of the seniors business over this disrupted timeframe
That team has been refocused now back on growing, as I noted before
We're actively in the small aspect of the 2017 process
The team has spent time together focused on the 2018 preparedness process, and they're ready to roll
That team is proud of the value proposition we deliver, and they're ready to roll to bring new programs and new relationships out to the seniors population to help change more lives
As it relates to the marketing spend, our team has been prepared, ready, focused on this, and they'll get the appropriate level of marketing support to make sure we're able to have the impact in 2018 we're looking forward to having
Briefly, just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight some key points from today's discussion
In the second quarter, we continued our momentum with organic earnings growth in all of our reporting segments
These results coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 EPS outlook of $9.75 to $10.05 per share
To further accelerate our strategic journey as a global health service company, we've taken our successful Go strategy to the next level, building on our differentiated results over the past seven-plus years
Our evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we seek to deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers
At Cigna, we have a team of 43,000 strong across the globe who wake up every day to serve and act as champions for our customers
Our team has proven time and again that they thrive in a dynamic and changing marketplace
We thank you again for joining our call today and look forward to our future conversations
