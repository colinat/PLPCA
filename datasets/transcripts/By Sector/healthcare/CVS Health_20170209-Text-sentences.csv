0,"Well, thanks, Nancy"
1,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us"
2,The solid fourth quarter results we posted today nicely wrap up our 2016 year
3,"And for the full year, consolidated net revenue increased 15.8%, with operating profit growing 8.3% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 13.2% with strong results across the enterprise"
4,And the growth rates I'm citing are on a comparable basis and you can find the non-GAAP adjustments on the slides we posted on our website
5,"Now, as expected, enterprise growth in the fourth quarter was solid with consolidated net revenues increasing 11.7%, operating profit increasing 4.6%, and adjusted EPS increasing 11.8% to $1.71, a penny above the high-end of our guidance"
6,"In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Retail/Long Term Care segment was in line with expectations and operating profit in the PBM segment was ahead of expectations"
7,"We generated approximately $1.5 billion of free cash during the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year, above the high-end of our guidance range"
8,And we'll continue to be thoughtful and discipline with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to shareholders
9,"For 2017, we are confirming the EPS and cash flow guidance we provided at our Analyst Day in December, and Dave will review the guidance details in his remarks"
10,"Now, before turning to the business update, I want to touch on a few areas of investor interest"
11,"And let me start on the topic of DIR within the Medicare Part D program, so we can correct some false and misleading statements in the marketplace which suggested that DIR performance network-based fees represent a material risk to our company; a statement that could not be further from the truth"
12,So here's what you need to know about DIR
13,"First, DIR includes any rebates, any discounts or other price concessions that are unknown at the point-of-sale; and DIR, ultimately, is utilized to reduce the net cost of the Med D program"
14,The second point; DIR performance network fees charged to pharmacies are allowed under CMS regulations
15,They're fully passed through from the PBM to their clients
16,They are fully disclosed as part of the annual bid process
17,"And, again, are ultimately used and reflected to help lower member premiums"
18,"As a matter of fact, member premiums over a five-year period have increased at a CAGR of just 1.7%"
19,So you can see the positive impact this is having on controlling costs
20,"The third point, and for the reasons just mentioned, CVS Caremark does not keep or profit from performance network-based DIR"
21,"And as a reminder to everyone, both CVS Pharmacy and CVS Specialty participate in the same performance network programs being called into question"
22,"The fourth point, network pharmacy providers are proactively informed of, and educated on, program details including their forecasted financial impact in advance of program implementation"
23,"And the fifth and final point, any suggestion that Part D plans favor high-priced drugs to drive people through the benefit and into catastrophic coverage faster is erroneous, and the data proves that"
24,"In fact, the percentage of our beneficiaries reaching the coverage gap and ultimately catastrophic coverage has decreased over the past several years and is a relatively small percentage of our overall population"
25,"Now, we don't think DIR is likely to go away given its effectiveness in helping to lower premiums"
26,"But hypothetically, if it were to go away, there would be a level playing field, we would remain quite competitive, and we would not expect any material impact on our business"
27,So I hope this clears up the gross misunderstandings surrounding DIR with the simple statements of fact
28,"So with that, let me move on to the topic of the potential repeal and replacement of the ACA"
29,"We believe it's important to provide affordable coverage for all Americans, which both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged"
30,"However, at this point, it's extremely difficult for us to comment on the possible scenarios that may play out in the coming months"
31,"And that said, CVS Health can pivot to address policy changes, help reduce healthcare costs, and bring meaningful solutions to the marketplace"
32,I also want to address the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing
33,"And whether it's new launches at elevated price points or increasing prices of older drugs, those contributing to a sense that government interventions are necessary and any suggestion that PBMs are causing drug prices to rise is simply erroneous"
34,We are the solution and not the problem
35,And that's why both public and private payers continue to count on PBMs as indispensable partners that help to manage their drug trend
36,"And numerous evaluations from the FTC, or the Congressional Budget Office and other government agencies have consistently concluded that PBMs operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to the healthcare economy"
37,And our CVS Caremark solutions have helped reduce crime client costs from an unmanaged gross trend of 11.8% to a managed trend of 3.3%; and those results are for the first three quarters of 2016.
38,"In addition, a recent industry study showed that every dollar invested in PBM services returned $6 in savings for clients and members"
39,So the value of PBMs is quantitatively pretty clear
40,And one additional topic that we've received a lot of questions about centers on the potential impact of corporate tax reform
41,"As you know, we are at the highest end of corporate tax payers given our domestic profile, with an effective tax rate around 39%"
42,"And the details of tax reform certainly will matter, and today, while there's a lot of discussion, nothing has been reduced to writing"
43,But suffice to say that a fairer tax code that includes a meaningful reduction in the effective corporate tax rate would allow CVS to unlock even greater economic opportunities
44,"So we certainly look forward to continuing to engage in the dialogue around all of these issues that may impact our industry, our business, and the clients and customers that we serve"
45,"So let me turn now to the business update, and I'll start with the 2017 PBM selling season"
46,"Our gross and net client wins are slightly higher that at Analyst Day with gross wins totaling nearly $7.9 billion, net new business around 4.4 billion and a client retention rate of around 97%"
47,"And these numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, which I'll touch on shortly"
48,"In addition, I'm pleased to say that we have had an outstanding welcome season, continuing our record of strong implementations over the last few years"
49,"We processed significant more transactions during this year's welcome season, and client satisfaction showed continued improvement across all business lines reaching record performance levels"
50,"And while we remain committed to improving and advancing every day, we continue to believe the investments we made in quality, automation and customer focus are delivering measurable value to our clients year after year"
51,"Looking ahead, we have about 23 billion up for renewal in 2018, which is comparable with prior years from a percent of business perspective"
52,"As for new business, it's pretty early to gauge the full extent of RFP activities in the 2018 selling season"
53,"And our strong service history, our size and scale, and our unique suite of capabilities gives us the tools we need to be successful in retaining business and winning in the marketplace as opportunities arise"
54,"Now, as we've discussed many times, top of mind for our clients continues to be managing their rapidly growing specialty trend"
55,And we offer a comprehensive set of solutions and continue to see solid growth in specialty
56,"And specialty revenues increased 12% in the fourth quarter, continuing to outpace the market"
57,"Our Medicare Part D business, SilverScript, wrapped up another successful annual enrollment period and retained its position as the number one PDP spots"
58,"We began the 2017 plan year with more than 5.5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs, and that's up about 10% from January of the prior year"
59,"When adding the Med D lives we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, the total rises to 12.3 million Med D lies under management"
60,And you can find a reconciliation of the Med D lives in the posted slides
61,"Now, moving on to the fourth quarter results and the Retail/ Long Term Care business, same-store prescription volumes increased 2%"
62,That's on a 30-day equivalent basis
63,"Total same-store sales decreased 0.7%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 0.2%"
64,Our pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by about 380 basis points due to recent generic introductions
65,And they were also negatively impacted by the decision to restrict CVS out of the TRICARE network
66,"And as we said on our last call, that network changes communicated in early October with a December 1 effective date"
67,And we saw these scripts begin to migrate out of our stores during the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations
68,Let me touch briefly on the CVS pharmacies within the Target stores
69,"And now that the integration is behind us, we're seeing improving script performance versus prior quarters; and this is being driven by the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice"
70,The Target pharmacies have also exhibited a solid operational foundation providing high levels of service to our patients
71,So we're making good progress since completing the integration activities and moving in the right direction
72,"In our Long Term Care pharmacy business, we continue to target the significant growth opportunities we see in the Assisted and Independent Living markets"
73,And we're focused on creating better solutions that meet the need of senior living communities and their residents
74,"And we're taking advantage of all of our enterprise assets, including CVS Pharmacy, our infusion properties and MinuteClinic"
75,"And we launched some new programs in these settings during 2016, we're piloting others in early 2017 and we'll have more on these programs in the coming quarters"
76,"Before turning to the front store, let me highlight our recent announcement on generic epinephrine"
77,"Given the urgent need in the marketplace for a less expensive epinephrine auto-injector for patients with life-threatening allergies, we partnered with Impax to purchase their product at a price lower than similar brand or authorized generic products"
78,"And we now have available at all CVS Pharmacy locations the authorized generic for Adrenaclick at a cash price of about $110, a price that's 80% lower than that of the brand competition in the market"
79,"And this move is consistent with the fact that increasing competition within therapeutic drug classes is a way to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and we're using our capabilities and our scale to do just that"
80,"Turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.9% as a result of softer customer traffic, combined with our continued focus on increasing personalization and rationalizing our promotional strategies"
81,"At the same time, front store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus last year"
82,"And keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of our enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a differentiated way producing margin flow-through"
83,"In fact, we have started to further reduce mass promotion in 2017 to better serve our loyal customers and continue driving profitable front store sales"
84,"We continue to focus on growing our beauty, healthcare and personal care businesses, and recognizing the growing presence in the digital market, we've been focused on enhancing our online capabilities to create an integrated health and pharmacy experience that only CVS can provide"
85,"CVS Curbside is now live in about 4,000 CVS Pharmacy stores and it provides a fast, seamless shopping experience with customers ordering products on their mobile devices and then picking them up at a CVS store without getting out of the car"
86,"We also introduced CVS Pay which allows customers to pick up prescriptions, use ExtraCare, pay for front store items, all with one scan of their CVS app"
87,"And this year, we plan to enhance our online shopping tool and further integrate personalization into digital platforms to increase engagement with health and beauty shoppers"
88,We also continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership
89,Our focus is on scaling our healthy food selection and optimizing our key categories in the health quadrant and elevating our beauty offerings while improving shopability
90,"And finally, Store Brands remain an area of strength and significant opportunity"
91,Our Store Brands represented 23.7% of front store sales in the quarter and that's up about 160 basis points from the same quarter a year ago
92,"Now, before turning it over to Dave for the financial review, I want to again acknowledge the near-term headwinds in the retail business this year given the unexpected network changes we highlighted late last year"
93,"And as previously outlined, we have a plan in place to return to more robust levels of earnings growth"
94,And let me quickly summarize this four-point plan in response to the near-term market dynamics
95,"First, we'll leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans to deliver the greatest overall healthcare value"
96,"And our partnership with Optum, which starts with a 90-day solution, is a great example and we look forward to discussing other long-term opportunities to bring together complementary capabilities that provide greater convenience and value for our clients and customers"
97,"We've begun to offer a menu of services to other PBMs and health plans as well, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and Long Term Care capabilities as a component of the CVS pharmacy value proposition"
98,"Second, we'll continue to innovate to bring new integrated PBM products to market that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model, while meeting the ongoing needs of our clients and members"
99,"Third, as we discussed on Analyst Day, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise streamlining initiative"
100,"And through these efforts, we expect to achieve nearly $3 billion in cumulative savings by 2021."
101,"And fourth, we have significant cash generation capabilities that provide us with a variety of ways to grow and return value to shareholders"
102,And we remain confident that we can achieve solid operating profit growth across the enterprise in the years ahead
103,"And our substantial cash flow affords us opportunities to bolster that growth, either through strategic acquisitions to supplement our existing asset base or through value-enhancing share repurchases"
104,"So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review"
105,"Well, thanks, Dave"
106,And we remain confident that we are well-positioned as the healthcare market continues to evolve
107,"We continue to have the most extensive suite of integrated enterprise assets, and on a stand-alone basis each one would be market-leading"
108,What really sets them apart lies in our ability in a large way through technology to integrate pharmacy care from the payer to the provider and ultimately to the patient
109,"And these capabilities help us to deliver on our goal of driving more affordable, more accessible, and more effective care"
110,"So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions"
111,Question-and-Answer Session
112,"Well, Lisa, it's a great question"
113,"And, first of all, I think it is important that the story be told in a succinct and factual way, starting with the key policymakers and decision-makers, and that starts in D"
114,And we've certainly been having those discussions in an effort to separate fact from fiction
115,"And I think for the reasons that I alluded to in my prepared remarks there, we need to deal with this issue today"
116,"But the PBM industry has dealt with this issue in the past and has gone through a series of reviews, as I alluded to earlier, whether it was through the FTC, through Congressional Budget Office, other governmental agencies that have quantified not just the role that PBMs play, but the value that PBMs bring to the healthcare economy"
117,"And so, it is important that we start there"
118,"And at the same time, listen, we're having an awful lot of discussions with our clients"
119,"And as we talk about transparency with them, I do believe that they understand the role that we bring for them"
120,"And I think that in this environment where benefit plan designs continue to evolve and change, I think we're doing more to share with them what we see as best practices across the industry, especially as you think about the growth of consumer-directed health plans and what it means to provide the value of those rebates or discounts at the point of sale and what it means to have a preventive drug list, where there's zero out of pocket expense for their members"
121,I just use those as two examples
122,"So, Lisa, I don't think there's a single answer to that other than â€“ which I think is where you were going â€"
123,“ it really needs to be a surround-sound dialogue with a variety of constituents
124,"Lisa, it's Larry again"
125,"I think when I hear you ask that question, you think about the rhetoric from those who are perhaps selling the drugs from those who are buying the drugs"
126,"And when you hear that, it gives me pause in terms of taking a step back and really asking the question, why are we in this position to begin with"
127,"And you look back and you think about just the sheer number of branded products that have come off patent over the last four, five years"
128,We've got nearly $100 billion of branded drugs that have lost patent protection
129,"Obviously, that's created somewhat of a headwind for the pharmaceutical industry"
130,You've got new products that have entered the market that to some degree I describe as me-too products that are entering the market at inflated price points with no incremental effectiveness over the existing therapies
131,"So why should sponsors of care pay for a higher price of those drugs, especially when many of those drugs are the ones that we're seeing advertised on TV, okay, countless times; and there's a cost to that"
132,"So I think when you start connecting the dots in terms of why the rhetoric now, what has changed in the marketplace that is driving this, it starts to bring some of that dialogue to the discussion"
133,"Lisa, I'll start, then I think Jon will want to jump in"
134,"But I think as we've talked many times, as we underwrite the business we underwrite it to an overall level of profitability, and there are many, many things â€"
135,"“ as we talked at Analyst Day, PBM tools that are utilized that create value for clients"
136,So the answer to that would be no
137,"There's many, many other things that we do that create value for our clients and their members"
138,"Let me start, then Helena will jump in"
139,"But, John, listen, when you look at the industry broadly, I do think that for many stakeholders across the supply chain the lines are blurry in terms of being competitors and at the same time being partners"
140,And I think that everybody is kind of learning their way around that
141,There are many examples of that out in the marketplace
142,"We shared some of those, beyond the example that you're alluding to, in terms of our CVS Pharmacy business"
143,But you look at our Med D business where we have SilverScript and at the same time we're managing the Med D benefit for about 40 of our health plan clients
144,"And we can show that while we're competing and at the same time partnering, the health plan growth for our clients has been faster than the market"
145,So I think it's a great example of how we can create a win-win situation
146,"And so, the answer to your question in terms of how broadly, quite frankly, it's with all the PBMs that we do business with"
147,And I'll flip it over to Helena to talk in a little more detail about those conversations
148,Next question?
149,"Good morning, Ross"
150,"Listen, it's a great question, and I think some of it goes back to the earlier point that I made that what can we do, how can we work with our clients on the PBM side in terms of best practices around plan design"
151,"Obviously, there's a completely different story for that consumer at the pharmacy counter if the rebate value is flowing through at the point-of-sale versus back to the client and the client reflecting that rebate value in some way, but it kind of gets diluted across the overall plan design benefit"
152,And I think we obviously see that as a best practice amongst some other things that we can talk about there
153,"And listen, I think some of the â€"
154,"“ you brought up epinephrine, and I think what we were able to do with Impax is a great example of what can happen when we can introduce more competition within a therapeutic class even though it may not be an A/B rated generic"
155,"And yes, it does require an intervention with their physician oftentimes"
156,But I do believe that the medical community is becoming more sensitized to price being a variable around the quality and continuity of care
157,"And by the way, we play that role at retail"
158,"And by the way, the PBM plays that role as well in the development of formularies"
159,"So, Ross, I think it's a complicated answer or question"
160,"It's an important question, and I think it'll continue to evolve"
161,We're already doing things and we're working hard to do more in that regard
162,"Well, Ross, listen, it's another great question"
163,And I think I'll probably take us back a minute to Analyst Day where we showed all of the different
164,I'll say assets that we operate
165,And the common denominator across those assets lies in the fact that we're delivering that last mile of care to the patient
166,"And by the way, it doesn't matter where you're at in the health care supply chain"
167,That becomes kind of the important conduit at the end of the day
168,"So I think there is a growing awareness and a growing understanding of the role that that can play, especially as there are more demands on changing consumer behavior, okay?"
169,"Quite frankly, it kind of goes back to your first question"
170,So I think it's that
171,And it comes back to the other question that was asked that we've got to figure this out recognizing that the folks that we're having these discussions with oftentimes are competitors as well
172,"So I think it starts with a recognition and an acknowledgment that in cracking the code around this, we can find the sweet spot and still be competitors, but at the same time be partners"
173,And I think we have some success stories
174,We're looking forward to growing that list of success stories with those objectives in mind
175,"And, Michael, it's Larry"
176,"I think the only point that I would add, and again it brings us back to the Analyst Day, but you may recall Alan Lotvin showed some examples of how using the pharmacy data, okay, we can provide a similar level of integration as one may be thinking about integrating medical and pharmacy benefits"
177,And there's a lot of information and diagnostic information that can be ascertained simply doing a deeper dive in terms of the pharmacy information that we have
178,"So we're looking to expand those capabilities, again, for the reasons that Jon acknowledged"
179,"Thanks, Steve"
180,Yeah
181,"And, Bob, it's Larry"
182,"Listen, I guess, I just want to emphasize Dave's comments, okay?"
183,"Because I think what we have seen over the last several weeks is more pharmaceutical companies coming out with, I'll call it, their version of the social contract, if you will"
184,"And, as Dave mentioned, typically you see pricing activity occur in January; and we've seen similar levels of activity, but at a lower rate"
185,So that's where it's coming from
186,"And as Dave pointed out, I think the fact that we're not changing our profit guidance and objectives reflects the comments that we made last year as this question was coming up that modest changes in inflation really have no impact on the profitability of the enterprise business"
187,"Listen, I think it's a great question"
188,And I think as we outlined in the prepared remarks that through the PBM lens we're working across the network to provide transparency across the pharmacy providers and providing education
189,"And by the way, when all this rhetoric began, we went back and we took a look at, if you looked at the overall reimbursement rates year-over-year, from 2016 to 2015, okay, in an environment where we've talked about pharmacy margins being under a lot of reimbursement pressures, there are many, many pharmacies to include some specialty pharmacies, in the SilverScript network that their reimbursement rates in 2016 were more favorable than what they were in 2015, largely as the result of the performance network fees and the performance that they demonstrated around that"
190,So I'm a little puzzled as to why all the rhetoric other than the fact that some people didn't get it right
191,"Thanks, Bob"
192,"Bob, I'll flip your second question over to Helena"
193,"And, David, it's Larry"
194,We also have some programs -- we've talked about these in the past -- on indication-based pricing which is a version of that
195,"To some degree, that's largely in specialty"
196,"We're working with pharma in a different way, okay, based more on outcomes with the patient"
197,"Eric, It's Larry"
198,"I'll start, and then I think Jon will jump in"
199,"I think to a large degree those opportunities are more time-driven based on the current or existing contract, and it's going to end up tying back to the RFP process"
200,And I would say that there continues to â€
201,"“ we've talked a lot over the last year about insourcing, outsourcing and the fact that we continue to believe that we bring a lot of value to that equation, and that there is â€"
202,“ makes a lot of sense
203,"I think when the health plan mergers were being bantered about, there was some growing concern around that"
204,And it looks like those are now in the rearview mirror
205,So we still continue to believe that we can bring value for smaller regional players
206,"And, listen, we have a great relationship with Aetna, and we look forward to continuing to be a key partner with them and helping them to grow"
207,"Next question, please?"
208,"And, Ricky, if you look at the 40 million prescriptions on our base at retail, it's about a 3.5% impact, if you will"
209,"350 basis points, from a script perspective"
210,"Ricky, it's still pretty early around that"
211,And keep in mind that health plans typically start a little earlier
212,"So, quite frankly, some of the stuff that's starting to come in right now is really for January of 2019 because of their cycle"
213,"So as we've done in prior years, we'll have more to say on this on the first quarter call"
214,We'll have a better idea of certainly the RFP activity consistent with prior years
215,"Thanks, Ricky"
216,"Listen, I think we're all very pleased with not just standing up Red Oak, but the value that it's bringing to the supply chain"
217,"And I think as we've talked previously, the incremental year-over-year benefit obviously has slowed because we've got it up and running, but I think the Red Oak team continues to look for ways in which we can make the supply chain more efficient"
218,And we're still looking and exploring those opportunities
219,So I think we're all very pleased with where we are today and where we're going with it
220,Yeah
221,"I would say, Alvin, we haven't seen any material change and it' a competitive, but rational market as you just acknowledged"
222,"So, Nelson, we'll take one more question, please"
223,Okay
224,"So with that, I know it's been a long call, but"
225,"hopefully we've provided a lot of information for you today and in light of some of the, I'll call them, current events in the marketplace"
226,And we appreciate everyone's time
227,"And as always, Nancy and Mike are available for any follow-ups you might have"
228,"Thanks, everyone"
