0,"Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon"
1,Q1 was in line with what we expected in Kidney Care
2,I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers
3,"Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis"
4,Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter
5,The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance
6,Let me elaborate on each
7,"First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and two fewer treatment days"
8,"Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed"
9,Let me repeat them and provide some additional color
10,We'll start with the four headwinds
11,"Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA plans"
12,"Number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages"
13,"Number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations"
14,"You won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements in other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters"
15,"Finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017, as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year"
16,Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds
17,"As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share programs to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from our recent renegotiated contract with Amgen"
18,The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we previously disclosed
19,"As a reminder, we received $538 million in March"
20,"Next, we're happy to announce the closing of the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1."
21,We acquired 38 centers in six states
22,"As part of the deal, we had to divest seven centers"
23,The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance
24,Keep in mind that we'll incur some one-time costs to integrate the business
25,"Finally, we just executed an extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD"
26,The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of comorbid conditions that ESRD patients have
27,Our strong clinical performance improves the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the healthcare system
28,"As to outlook, we're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion"
29,"As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on healthcare in our country and on our business"
30,We will continue to monitor political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions
31,"Now, on to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG"
32,"Yeah, Gary"
33,"As you know, there's a wide distribution of rate"
34,And what we want to do is make sure that we do what's right for the long term
35,"So sometimes, we have some of their outliers that we need to bring in, and we do have a small set of out-of-network rates, and so those are sometimes the one we're discussing here"
36,We are seeing the benefit as we expected
37,"And of course, we had to go down, wind down some inventory that we had, but we are experiencing the contract as we anticipated"
38,"As it relates to the spike on the seasonal, of course, it's very hard to predict and isolate because of the flu season"
39,", it's sort of a moving target, if you will"
40,"And with the prescriptions the way they are, meaning every physician gets to make their own, it's almost impossible to diagnose a number"
41,"But if you had to put it in a range or you had to bracket it, I'd put it anywhere from $5 million to $15 million or so"
42,"On that, it's just basically we're winding down from inventory that was purchased at the previous contract"
43,"So, it's probably not worth worrying about"
44,"Hi, Justin"
45,I did
46,And we did not provide additional detail on the numbers
47,We were just clarifying a number that was thrown out
48,That wasn't a number that we had cited in the past
49,"There are some that are handicapped, which we always do for you"
50,We try to give the best stab in anticipating what's going to transpire during the year
51,And then there are some that have been agreed to and have an effective date that hasn't been incorporated in Q1.
52,"Correct, it will be in our run rate"
53,Let me see
54,"I don't think I could give you any additional detail on that, Justin"
55,What have we disclosed?
56,"The trends on what, Justin?"
57,"Yeah, we're seeing it moderate, I guess, to use your word, flat"
58,"It's in the range but as we disclosed, it's not a very significant number for the year"
59,Yeah
60,It's really hard to parse through what's going on
61,"And so why patients are doing what they're doing with plans, exiting and other things around it"
62,"So instead of giving you a specific answer, let me just give you the total"
63,"We're at 3,000, and we're at 2,500."
64,"And so we can't parse through with clarity as to why the number changed, but that's probably better just to give you where it ends â€"
65,"“ well, where it is as opposed to where it ends"
66,It's fair
67,"Well, Justin, I'll go first on this one"
68,"It varies all over the map and not only by a private payer does it vary by contract, but also even within Medicare and Medicare Advantage, it differs geographically and it differs by what the baselines are that you start with"
69,So it's a wide distribution curve
