0,"Well thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone"
1,"I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance for the first quarter, and I'll start with a few comments on HCV"
2,Starting with the U.S
3,", approximately 700,000 people have initiated HCV therapy since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013, with 90% receiving a sofosbuvir-based regimen"
4,Total U.S
5,"revenue from Gilead's HCV therapies for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially"
6,"The decrease in sequential revenue was driven by the declining sales of Epclusa, resulting in lower inventory, as well as some loss of market share as a result of increased competition"
7,"For the remainder of 2017, while increased competition will have some level of impact on patient share and pricing, we expect that the continued decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease in revenue"
8,This decline in starts is driven by the evolving profile of patients that are in care
9,62% of patients initiating therapy in the first quarter had fibrosis scores of F0 to F2.
10,"That's the highest we've seen for this metric, and indicative of the fact that patients are coming into care with earlier-stage disease, a trend that is illustrated on slide 26."
11,"Over the last six months, we've introduced two new direct-to-consumer campaigns"
12,The first launched in late 2016 with the goal of increasing screening among baby boomers
13,"We were pleased to see that this campaign, along with the efforts of organizations like the CDC, had an immediate effect, with a 24% increase in HCV antibody testing among undiagnosed baby boomers over the first two months of implementation"
14,"The second campaign launched in March, and is directed towards diagnosed patients with a goal of encouraging them to seek treatment with Harvoni"
15,"We hope these campaigns will continue to have an impact, and will help more individuals seek testing, linkage to care and treatment"
16,"It's important to remember that while the timeline for a patient to go from entering care to initiating therapy has lengthened and is more variable, there are still nearly 3 million people with HCV infection in the U.S"
17,", only half of whom are diagnosed"
18,"Turning to Europe, HCV revenues were down 42% year-over-year and 22% sequentially"
19,Quarterly revenues of $487 million were negatively impacted by lower market share as a result of increased competition
20,"During the quarter, we negotiated new agreements with France and Italy to expand access to HCV patients regardless of fibrosis score"
21,"This means that there are now 14 European countries, including four of the five major markets, that allow patient access regardless of disease severity"
22,"In addition, Epclusa has now been launched in all five of the major markets in Europe, and will be an important treatment option as some countries have a high percentage of genotype 2 and 3 patients"
23,"These patients and their health care providers have been waiting for an effective therapy that does not require co-administration of ribavirin, or extended treatment durations"
24,"In Japan, HCV product sales for the first quarter were $205 million, down 81% year-over-year and down 35% sequentially, due to a decrease in patient starts and increased competition"
25,"In the Japanese market, nearly 130,000 patients have been treated with a sofosbuvir-based regimen since the launch of Sovaldi in May 2015."
26,"Because there remain many untreated patients, we continued to implement our direct-to-consumer education campaign to broaden the awareness of HCV in Japan"
27,"Worldwide, 1.4 million patients have now initiated HCV therapy with a Gilead regimen in less than four years"
28,"With SOF/VEL/VOX, our investigational pan-genotypic single-tablet regimen for salvage therapy under regulatory review, we expect to complete our portfolio of HCV therapies later this year"
29,"Now turning to HIV, we are pleased with the rapid adoption and acceptance of our TAF-based regimens by patients and physicians in the U.S"
30,and Europe
31,In the U.S
32,", HIV and HBV revenues were $2.3 billion in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially"
33,"As Robin stated earlier, the quarter-on-quarter decline is consistent with the typical seasonality that we see in sub-wholesaler inventory"
34,"Importantly, first quarter revenue from our TAF portfolio exceeded $1 billion for the first time, which translates to a quarter-on-quarter growth of 47%"
35,The launch of our TAF portfolio continued to drive the year-on-year growth of the Gilead HIV franchise
36,Genvoya represents nothing less than the most successful launch in U.S
37,HIV history as measured by cumulative total prescriptions over the first five quarters following launch
38,"By the end of 2016, Genvoya remained the most prescribed regimen for treatment-naÃ¯ve patients, counting for nearly one in three patients"
39,"More broadly, our TAF-based regimens now represent 42% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume just 17 months after the launch of Genvoya, and less than a year after the launches of Odefsey and Descovy"
40,Truvada for PrEP also continues to be an important growth driver for Gilead
41,"We've seen a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 125,000 patients using Truvada as we exited the quarter"
42,This is encouraging given the important role that PrEP plays in preventing HIV transmission
43,"Turning to Europe, HIV and HBV revenues were $697 million in the first quarter, down 3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially"
44,Year-over-year volume growth driven by TAF portfolio launches was offset primarily by FX
45,"Notably, the TAF portfolio revenue grew by 24% quarter-on-quarter"
46,I'm pleased to report that Genvoya launched in France and Italy during the quarter
47,"Genvoya is now available in 23 European countries, including all major markets"
48,"In France, the second largest HIV market in the world, Genvoya is off to a particularly strong start"
49,"And in early launch markets like Germany, TAF-based regimens already account for up to 60% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume"
50,This demonstrates the rapid acceptance of TAF by national health systems and the importance of an optimized safety profile for people living longer with HIV
51,"The TAF portfolio has achieved preferred status and treatment guidelines in four of the five major EU markets, as well as the EACS guidelines, with preferred status anticipated in France in the third quarter of this year"
52,"Shifting away from HIV and HCV, our U.S"
53,cardiovascular team continues to deliver impressive results
54,"Letairis remains the market leader in PAH with a naÃ¯ve patient share greater than the top two ERA competitors combined, while Ranexa is ranked in the top five cardiovascular branded products in terms of revenue for each of the past two years"
55,"In closing, we were pleased with our first quarter results"
56,For the remainder of the year we will continue to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from Gilead products around the world
57,I would now like to turn the call over to John
58,"Yes, and, Kevin, just to add on that, and I agree with everything you said"
59,I think HIV is a bit of a different market over the years
60,"Of all the markets, of all the chronic therapy markets Gilead's ever been in, it's been driven more by increases in patient volume than by changes in price"
61,"And there's always some element of both in every therapeutic area that you're in, but disproportionately in HIV"
62,There's always been a healthy steady flow of number of treated patients each year
63,"As I think you're probably aware, and as Kevin just said, we're already in heavily, deeply-discounted payer segments in the U.S"
64,What that means is that's already part of the run rate
65,So the normal impact of a generic is a big change from where you are
66,"We're already, especially for the older products that are going to be coming off patent, the difference between generic pricing and where those prices are right now is much more incremental than you'd see in most markets, and anyways, that's something that's just very unique with that"
67,"We continue to see obviously a strong support for single-tablet regimens and fixed-dose combinations, and of course, there will be some level of impact whenever there is generic entry, particularly outside of the U.S"
68,"But we still very firmly believe that when we want to ultimately have the full launch of our entire TAF portfolio, particularly BIC/TAF, B-F/TAF, that this remains very much a sustainable franchise going forward"
69,"Again, I would say we hear sometimes how sustainable is price levels in HIV"
70,That really hasn't been the story of HIV
71,"It's really, I mean particularly in the U.S"
72,"market, because of the deeply-discounted segments and the CPI-U penalties you have over time, this has been a market that has overwhelmingly been driven by patient volume"
73,So we're not as reliant on that
74,"We have not been historically as reliant on, if you look at list pricing for sure, it's there"
75,"But net pricing has deteriorated over time, and that's already in the run rate"
76,"But I'll stop there, and we feel very confident in this being a sustainable franchise"
77,Sure
78,"So starting with PrEP, what we're seeing very encouragingly, and"
79,"I think consistent with CDC guidance and data, is that we're starting to see persistency that is very similar to patients taking antiretroviral therapy for treatment, and that's what you want"
80,"Frankly, three, four years ago, PrEP prescribing was very episodic, and we're not seeing that now"
81,So that's not just a good thing for Gilead
82,", I think that's a good thing for patients"
83,That's what the data would say is the way that PrEP should be prescribed
84,"So we're not seeing very much shade of light between those two, and because of that, we do see this as a significant continued driver of growth"
85,"I think as we said in the last earnings call, 90% of PrEP prescribing was coming out of five cities coming into this year, and they weren't the cities where a lot of the epidemic is really starting to unfortunately increase, areas like New Orleans, DC, Newark, Oakland, the Bronx"
86,"And part of our efforts, both with the field-based team that we deployed of prevention specialists, and also with some of our education that we're doing is geared towards those markets, because honestly I think that's where the needle can be moved the most"
87,"Yeah, so my apologies that I didn't hear all that"
88,I think I have it now
89,"But I think what we have seen in Germany is consistent with what we've seen in other early launch markets in Europe, which is number one, rapid adoption or rapid acceptance of the TAF profile and treatment guidelines"
90,"Again, we have it in four of the five markets right now in addition to EACS"
91,"But also a strong desire to appropriately, depending on the label, move patients to the TAF-based regimens"
92,"And because Genvoya launched earlier there, that's a good example of what we're seeing in some of our earlier markets"
93,The example we gave was Germany
94,It was up to 60%
95,"We also have some earlier launch markets in the Nordics and in some of the northern European countries that tend to launch earlier that are there or thereabouts, closer to 60%"
96,"So the encouraging thing for us, too, is that as we mentioned, we just launched Genvoya in France this quarter and in Italy literally at the end of the quarter"
97,So we've got a lot of room to grow there and try to get up to the levels that we've seen in the other countries
98,But I think it's primarily a function of
99,just it was an earlier launch
100,People are seeing good results
101,"They realize that this is a patient population that is aging, and the attributes of TAF in a 50 to 60 year old patient are even more important than they are in a 40 year-old patient, and I think we're seeing that reflected"
102,"I think the one final thing I'd say is that in some quarters there's some worry that as you get into some of the generic options, that choice will be taken out of physicians' hands, so you do see a lot of physicians wanting to switch to TAF while they have the ability to do that"
103,And that makes a lot of sense
104,"I do, yes"
105,"I mean, I've said it, and"
106,Norbert's probably â€
107,“ we've all said it in this room
108,I truly believe that it is the first single-tablet regimen we've had without tradeoffs
109,And I believe that most of our physicians see it that way too
110,"And I'm looking at my clinical colleagues in the room here, and that's what we hear from our advisors"
111,Sure
112,"So, yeah, the VA as you know in the past has been at times one in four patient starts for us in any given quarter"
113,"The VA is experiencing the same dynamics outside the VA where we are seeing a steady gradual decline in the number of treated patients, due largely to the changing profile of the patient under care"
114,"We're seeing it actually in a little bit more of an accelerated manner in the VA, simply because they were so efficient and so effective in getting their folks into care and getting them treated"
115,So they actually have been able to treat about 50% of their population
116,So we would anticipate that the VA would continue to represent a smaller and smaller percentage of our overall treated patient population
117,Yes
118,I'm sorry the question was â€
119,"“ so if you think about market share across Europe, you know we had about the same number of patients this quarter as we did last quarter, but what you are seeing, you are correct on a dollar basis it goes down, and that's somewhat a shift from the patients in the north to the patients in the south, which is sort of a natural again evolution because there are more patients in southern Europe where the prices are lower than they are in northern Europe where we have had a good run at curing a high percentage of the patients already"
120,So I think that trend will likely continue
121,"Particularly in France, yes"
