0,"Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all"
1,"As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $16.1 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted share"
2,And our 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pre-tax or $0.11 per diluted share
3,"For the full-year, our full-year 2016 results also include restructuring costs"
4,"Those restructuring costs are $45.9 million pre-tax or $0.42 per diluted share and full-year 2015 results include restructuring costs of $34.9 million pre-tax or $0.32 per diluted share, as well as a one-time income tax benefit, net of non-controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted shares"
5,"When I discuss our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, the non-GAAP basis will exclude the restructuring costs and the one-time tax benefit in the prior year"
6,"We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business"
7,"These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes, and should not be regarded as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures"
8,You can see Exhibit B in this morning's earnings release that has a complete reconciliation of those non-GAAP adjustments
9,"Okay, let me also point out that the fourth quarter of 2016 included one additional selling week compared with the fourth quarter of 2015."
10,This week is the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's
11,We report on what's called a 52/53 week fiscal year ending always on the last Saturday in December
12,"So, the next time our results will include an extra selling week will be in 2022."
13,"So, in order to facilitate more meaningful comparisons, we will provide a separate estimate"
14,"We are providing a separate estimate of the impact of the extra week on our sales growth, as well as providing internal sales growth in local currencies excluding that impact"
15,"Okay, so turning to our results now"
16,"Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, reflecting a 9.5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2015."
17,"Our internally generated sales, in local currencies, were up 4.2%, acquisitions contributed 1.3%, there was a 1.5% decrease due to foreign exchange, and the growth attributed to this extra week was estimated at 5.5%"
18,You could see all of these details of our sales growth contained in Exhibit A in our earnings news release
19,"Our operating margin, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 6.9% and contracted by 18 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015."
20,There are three key elements that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin that I'd like to discuss and these three key elements negatively impacted operating margin by about 30 basis points in total
21,The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the first 12 months and the related expenses as well as switches between agency sales and direct sales in our Animal Health business which combined to negatively impact the contraction by 7 basis points for the quarter
22,"Secondly, influenza vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points"
23,And the third item relates to an increase in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year and that negatively impacted the contraction by 8 basis points
24,"If you were to exclude the net impact of these three items, our operating margin expanded by 12 basis points"
25,Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4% that compares to 30.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
26,The tax effect of the restructuring costs recorded in the fourth quarter increased our effective tax rate by about 20 basis points in 2016 and about 30 basis points in 2015.
27,"Our full-year 2016 effective tax rate was 28.8% on a GAAP basis and, again, the effect of restructuring costs recorded for the full-year increased the effective tax rate by another 20 basis points in 2016 and 30 basis points in 2015."
28,"For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% range"
29,"I'd also like to note that in 2017, we are implementing a new accounting standard called ASU 2016-09."
30,This new accounting standard requires excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation to be recognized as a reduction in income tax expense in the period which the stock awards vest
31,"As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to be favorably impacted in 2017 and this will primarily occur in the first quarter as this is when most stock-based awards at Henry Schein vest"
32,This impact will occur each year in Q1 and will have varying effects on the annual effective tax rate
33,"Therefore, because of this, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, this is for Q1 only"
34,"And we still expect that this Q1 impact is included in our estimated effective tax rate for the full-year which, on a full-year basis, will remain in that 28% range"
35,"Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc"
36,on a GAAP basis was $139.2 million or $1.73 per diluted share
37,"That represents increases of 7.1% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015."
38,"Excluding restructuring costs, non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter was $151.3 million or $1.88 per diluted share"
39,"And that represents increases of 8.6% and 12.6%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, also on a non-GAAP basis"
40,I'd like to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.02 and this was partially offset by share repurchase benefit of approximately $0.01 for the quarter
41,"So, let's now look at some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter"
42,Our Dental sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 7.7% to $1.5 billion
43,"Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 1.6%, acquisitions contributed an additional 1.7%, there was a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange, and growth attributed to the extra week was estimated at 5.4%"
44,"We look at North America, our North American internal growth in local currency was 2.2% and included 1.9% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and services revenue"
45,"As I mentioned last quarter, there was some acceleration of our equipment sales from Q4 to Q3 and that was associated in part with promotional activities that we discussed on our last conference call"
46,"It's also important to note that we saw strong growth in the North American consumable merchandise and equipment sales in December, even excluding the estimated impact of the extra week"
47,I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals earlier this year
48,This is something we've also talked about on the last few conference calls
49,This decision negatively impacted our North American dental consumable merchandise sales growth in the quarter by about 50 basis points and this will continue for one additional quarter â€
50,"“ first quarter of 2017, at which time it will annualize"
51,"International dental internal growth in local currencies was 0.7%, included 2.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise, and 3.9% decline in dental equipment sales and service revenue"
52,This decline was primarily due to a difficult prior year comparison in international equipment sales and service revenue
53,"We also expect the softness in international dental equipment sales to continue in Q1 as we approach the IDS trade show, which is in late March, and anticipate an acceleration of equipment sales thereafter"
54,"On an overall basis, we continue to believe we outpaced the global dental market in Q4 and believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remains strong"
55,"Turning to Animal Health sales, they were $837.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10.8%, internally generated sales in local currencies was up 8.2%, acquisitions contributed 0.4%, there was a 3.4% decrease due to foreign exchange and growth attributed to the extra week is estimated at 5.6%"
56,The 8.2% internal growth in local currency has included 10.3% growth in North America and 6.3% growth internationally
57,"When normalizing for Animal Health results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales, that 8.2% internal local currencies was 7.8% growth and included 9.3% growth in North America"
58,We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business
59,These were solid results as we believe we continued to gain market share both domestically as well as overseas
60,Our Medical sales for the quarter was $621.1 million for the fourth quarter and that was an increase of 10.6%
61,"Sales growth in local currencies was 4.4%, all internally generated, with 0.1% of small decrease due to foreign exchange, and growth attributed to the extra week estimated at 6.3%"
62,It's important to note that timing of influenza vaccine sales negatively impacted the Medical sales growth by 1.2%
63,"And if you exclude this impact, our sales growth in local currencies was 5.6%"
64,"Of this 4.4% growth, 4.5% was in North America and growth of 0.9% in local currencies internationally"
65,We are pleased with our Medical growth as we also believe we gained market share in this business unit
66,"Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $112.2 million in the quarter, an increase of 19.6%"
67,"That consisted of internally generated sales in local currencies, up 8.5%, acquisitions contributing an additional 9.8%, and a decrease due to foreign exchange of 1.9%"
68,And finally growth attributed to the extra week is estimated at 3.2%
69,"Of that 8.5% internal growth in local currencies, 7.4% was in North America and 13.9% growth internationally"
70,The Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth in local currencies was highlighted by solid growth in both our software services revenues in North America as well as internationally
71,"We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter, more specifically we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $156.10 per share and that equated to approximately $200 million"
72,The impact of this repurchase on shares for the fourth quarter was positive by about $0.01 per share
73,"For the full-year of 2016, we repurchased $550 million of our stock, representing 3.5 million shares at an average price of $158.88 per share"
74,"And while this was above our originally stated goal, we saw an opportunity to be more aggressive when our stock price declined"
75,Our share repurchase program continues to demonstrate our long-term commitment to create further value to shareholders and reflects our confidence in long-term prospects of the business
76,"At the close of the quarter, Henry Schein had about $250 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock"
77,"And we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large of portion of annual free cash flow to both repurchases and acquisitions, continues to drive increased shareholder value"
78,"Let's briefly look at our balance sheet and cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was $264.5 million"
79,That compares to $298.3 million last year
80,"For the year, the operating cash flow was over $600 million â€“ $615.5 million to be exact"
81,Our CapEx for the year was $70.2 million and that results in free cash flow of $545.3 million for the year
82,"As I mentioned earlier, we are really pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow for the year"
83,Accounts receivable days outstanding was about 41.3 days
84,That compares to 39.3 days last year
85,Our inventory turns was 5.5 turns for quarter
86,That compares to 5.6 turns last year
87,"And finally, I'd like to conclude by reaffirming our 2017 guidance for the year"
88,Our diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017.
89,I'd like to point out that if the U.S
90,"dollar continues to strengthen, we may come in at the low-end of this range"
91,"And obviously, we can't predict well what's going to happen with the U.S"
92,dollar
93,so we just wanted to point out that we do have sensitivity to the U.S
94,dollar strengthening
95,We'd also like to note that we have concluded our restructuring program
96,We do not expect to have any further structuring expenses in 2017.
97,"And as a result, there is no separate guidance on a non-GAAP basis since we will not have any non-GAAP EPS for the year"
98,"That guidance reflects growth of 16% to 18% compared to 2016 GAAP diluted EPS, and 8% to 10% compared to 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS"
99,"As always, the 2017 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions, if any"
100,"And as I said earlier, guidance assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels"
101,"So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Stanley"
102,I would say similar comments internationally
103,"Markets are stable, they're consistently growing"
104,"Historically, we've always seen the international markets grow a little bit slower than the U.S"
105,They're a little bit more comparable at the current time
106,We absolutely believe we're gaining market share in international dental
107,"So, I would say that steady-as-"
108,she-goes
109,and I think that the consistency in the market should continue going forward
110,"Now, of course, that the consumable comment, you know we do have lumpiness related to equipment and the IDS show that we talked about"
111,"So, IDS, typically people delay purchases in this current quarter to see new models and new show specials for equipment later in the quarter and that turns into sales in Q2 and Q3."
112,"So, we'll see some lumpiness there on international dental equipment sales"
113,I think that's exactly right
114,We weren't expecting to buy back as much as we bought back
115,"In hindsight, it turns out to be even a good â€"
116,“ a very good short-term decision
117,"But longer term, we expect it to be even a better decision because we do have high confidence in the business"
118,The foreign exchange has been a headwind
119,It has been a headwind for 2016.
120,It's still a headwind for 2017.
121,"And because of the unpredictability of foreign exchange, those two kind of counteract each other"
122,Okay
123,"So, I would say there's no significant variance that I've seen between large DSOs and middle market"
124,"It seems to be more across the board, although we personally are seeing stronger growth in our middle market"
125,That's an area that we have keen focus on
126,But I think the overall market is relatively consistent
127,"As you know, Steve, we've seen periods of time,"
128,"so we're optimistic where December and January will continue, but there's no certainty in that"
129,"We've seen times where â€“ again, lumpiness in sales"
130,"But right now, things seem to be pointing to a slight acceleration in the U.S"
131,dental market
132,"And remember just one other thing, Steve"
133,that's consumable comment
134,"Equipment, on the other hand, because of the strong December that we had and because of Section 179, which typically pulls sales forward from Q1 into Q4, you have to expect that Q1, you'll see lighter equipment sales because of that tax benefit that pulled forward"
135,And that's a bit of a timing thing that should occur each year now going forward given that the Section 179 is now permanent
136,We're still a little bit perplexed as to why it occurred
137,"And Stanley, actually, I think, in his comments said something similar to that"
138,There's really no additional data points that we've seen that give us any greater clarity as to why it happened
139,We just know it did
140,"And again, hopefully, the long-term prospects of the dental market will continue to be favorable"
141,"The demographics are still on our favor, people taking better care of their oral healthcare, aging population, all of that"
142,"So, I wish,"
143,"Jeff, I had a better answer"
144,but we really don't have more clarity on that
145,"So, you're correct in â€“ for Q4, the extra week was a little bit negative"
146,"I haven't calculated the exact amount, but was a little bit negative to overall Q4 operating margins"
147,"Again, the main reason is it's a light week for sales"
148,"And with two-thirds of our expenses being compensation and compensation-related, you get a full week of compensation"
149,"So, margins were a little bit lower there"
150,"On full year 2017, yes, our guidance does assume at least 20 basis points of operating margin expansion and it's correct to note that's on what we like to call same-store basis, meaning it excludes the impact, if any, of any acquisitions that could be positive or negative to that number"
151,But we do believe that there's still room for margin expansion going forward
152,Sure
153,We'll start with the last part first
154,"The 2017 guidance really only assumed a very modest improvement in end market conditions, not just for Dental, but for all of our markets"
155,"So, it was more consistent, but with some slight improvement"
156,"February, we didn't comment on because when you start segmenting months and looking at it in a particular week-by-week basis, you really couldn't get misleading results"
157,But we don't think â€
158,“ we wouldn't have said December and January unless we believed that there was potential for it to continue
159,"But looking at the specific weeks, it's too short a period to really draw conclusions from"
