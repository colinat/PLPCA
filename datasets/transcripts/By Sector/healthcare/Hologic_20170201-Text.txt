Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone
We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted solid results
Both revenue and earnings per share exceeded our guidance, illustrating the progress we're making on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company
As we discussed at the recent JP Morgan conference, the success of our turnaround to-date has been based largely on improved execution by our U.S
commercial teams
They stabilized market-leading products that were once in decline, and optimized the potential of innovative growth drivers
Both of these trends continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. But at the same time, we are beginning to see the next chapter of our growth story emerge this quarter in two important areas
First, our efforts to revitalize our research and development pipeline are beginning to bear fruit, as new products contributed progressively more to growth
And second, we generated growth internationally after four consecutive quarters of declines in fiscal 2016. While we realize we still have much work to do outside the United States, we are encouraged by the progress we are making and the foundations we are building
As we look toward the future, new products and international growth will play an increasingly important role in our success
And we expect a third area, business development, to contribute as well
In this regard, the divestiture of our blood screening business, which closed yesterday, will increase our financial flexibility as we seek growth through acquisitions and other capital deployment activities
With that introduction out of the way, we'd like to provide an overview of our first quarter revenue results, highlighting both established growth drivers and the early contributions from new products and international
Then I'll review the blood screening sale briefly before handing the call over to Bob
Let's start with our first quarter results
Revenue of $734.4 million grew 5.6% on a reported basis, or 6.3% in constant currency
We posted good growth over and above our most difficult comparison from the prior year
As a reminder, sales in last year's first quarter grew a strong 8.1% in constant currency
This quarter we also absorbed a headwind of roughly 50 basis points from discontinued products, mainly a cystic fibrosis test in molecular diagnostics
On the positive side, as discussed in our last quarterly call, we benefited from four extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's, which we estimate contributed roughly half our growth for the quarter
In terms of geography, U.S
sales grew a healthy 5.2% in the quarter, versus a very difficult comp from a year ago when sales increased 12.8%
This performance was a continuation of strong recent results, and once again validated the quality of both our products and our people
We are also encouraged that international sales grew 6.1% excluding blood screening
Growth was again led by our molecular diagnostics and surgical franchises, both of which grew faster than 20% in constant currency, and are beginning to show results from the foundations we have built over the last couple of years
While international sales clearly improved, we want to emphasize that it's only one quarter, and we are still very much a start-up outside the United States
But now we have our leadership team in place and are beginning to establish a strong basis for future growth
As a reminder, in the past 12 months we have hired four new commercial leaders for Latin America, Asia Pacific, Canada and Europe
Now let's turn to divisional performance in the first quarter
Surgical remained our growth leader, and posted its eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth globally
Let me emphasize that's two years of double-digit revenue growth -- not to mention high profitability -- from a division that many people thought we should sell three years ago
In the first quarter, which is seasonally strong for Surgical, sales were $114.8 million, an increase of 17.2%
MyoSure led the way by posting sales of $48.3 million and growth of 32.1%
We are achieving exceptional growth for MyoSure as our commercial teams continue to expand the market and capitalize on our new MyoSure Reach line extension
As a side note, MyoSure Reach was the biggest sales contributor in the basket of new products that we track regularly
Last quarter we said these products exceeded $10 million in quarterly sales for the first time, and this quarter they showed good growth on a sequential basis
NovaSure sales of $66.4 million grew 8.6%, as we continued to capture market share based on a competitive withdrawal
We should point out, however, that we have almost completely annualized this benefit, so NovaSure growth rates are expected to slow going forward, as we previously forecast
Before we leave Surgical, let me mention that we recently received FDA approval for our new NovaSure Advanced line extension
We are pleased that in GYN Surgical, like the rest of our divisions, R&D is becoming an integral part of our growth strategy
For example, over the last few quarters, we have been able to gain U.S
approval for two new products that will extend our leadership position in the field
Moving to Diagnostics, we posted sales of $325.4 million in the first quarter, and 5.5% growth
In molecular diagnostics, sales of $139.9 million grew 8.8% -- despite the discontinued products headwind-- based on share gains and increased utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument
Of note, international sales grew 25.8% as we continue to see the benefits of new leadership, record Panther placements, and increasing assay pull-through on those instruments
Specifically, revenue from our three viral load assays is increasing nicely in Europe, although admittedly off a small base
And in the United States this quarter, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our first viral load assay, for HIV-1. This is a highly complex assay that required a prospective clinical trial and a Pre-Market Approval from the FDA, so the approval is a testament to the quality of our Diagnostics R&D and clinical teams
Building on the HIV approval, we hope to gain clearance for our hepatitis C test later this fiscal year, and our hepatitis B assay in 2018. Once we have all three viral assays approved in the U.S
, we are optimistic that they will begin contributing to domestic revenue growth
Elsewhere in Diagnostics, blood screening sales of $65.2 million exceeded our expectations and grew 7.4%
Most of the upside came from initial sales to support investigational testing for the Zika virus, and from international ordering by our partner Grifols that rebounded from very low levels a year ago
Overall, blood screening sales declined in the United States, but increased significantly in international markets, so keep that in mind as you're analyzing the performance of our core businesses by geography
Finally, cytology and perinatal sales were $120.3 million in the quarter, with modest global growth of 1.1%, as domestic share gains by our ThinPrep liquid Pap test continued to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals
It's worth mentioning that while cytology products comprise more than 85% of this revenue line, the perinatal portion of the business has started to perform better as well
This will be an area to watch in the future as we revitalize our new product development efforts
Now let's move on to Breast Health, where global sales of $273.3 million grew 4.6%
Domestic placements of our innovative, market-leading Genius 3D mammography systems again increased modestly, and orders remain healthy
We continue to gain market share while maintaining price discipline, based on our superior product profile and strong customer relationships
And we still have significant conversion runway ahead of us, as less than 45% of our domestic installed base has upgraded to our Genius platform thus far
Importantly, other supplemental growth drivers have begun to emerge in Breast Health, as we very deliberately planned
Specifically, in the mammography segment, strong growth in service revenues from a growing installed base of Genius systems, combined with sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, drove a 5.5% increase in domestic sales
Outside the United States, Breast Health sales were basically flat, as we continue to work, on a country-by-country basis, to optimize our channel strategy and build our commercial capabilities
With each passing quarter we feel better about our prospects here
But as we have said before, it will take time to fully realize the considerable opportunity in front of us
To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $20.9 million decreased 10.7%
Although this is a small business for us, this performance is clearly unacceptable
As a result, we have refocused our commercial efforts, and are beginning to see an increase in DXA bookings that bodes well for improved performance later this year
Now let me shift gears and touch briefly on our blood screening divestiture, which closed yesterday
As a reminder, we sold our stake in our blood screening business to our former commercial partner, Grifols, for a purchase price of $1.85 billion in cash
Blood screening was a non-strategic business for us, as our partner managed sales and marketing, and we lacked the ability to control our own commercial destiny
We believe this deal makes Hologic a fundamentally stronger company in 2017 and beyond
We are receiving excellent value for our blood screening assets
The $1.85 billion purchase price represented a premium to our own, internal valuation on an after-tax basis, and is particularly attractive when you consider the underlying headwinds facing the blood screening market, both declining unit volumes and increased price competition
By monetizing the business today, we have significantly derisked our portfolio going forward
In addition, divesting the blood screening business removes a drag on our growth, which will enable us to increase both revenues and EPS at a faster rate
And as competitive pressures intensify, this benefit will likely increase over time
And finally, the deal markedly strengthens our balance sheet and increases our financial flexibility to grow through acquisitions
As mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that M&A -- as a supplement to internal innovation, commercial execution and international expansion-- will be an important part of our future growth strategy
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that Hologic is off to a good start in 2017. In the first quarter, our domestic commercial organization continued to drive growth of our market-leading products
At the same time, the next chapter of our growth story began to emerge, as new products and international started to contribute
As a result, both revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance
And we significantly increased our financial flexibility by divesting our blood screening business for an attractive price
Now I will turn the call over to Bob
We've had a lot more calls from bankers, but I would say we are pursuing the same plan
We've got a lot more people that we meet with -- at various conferences
But, at the end of the day Dan, we are keeping very focused, very disciplined and going about things to see where we've always been
We continue to be in very close touch with our sales folks around, are they sensing anything changes in the environment, we are not hearing much or anything
And I will tell you, I think we continue to feel very good about the bookings that are still coming in on the business
So, that can always change
But, nothing at all at this point
Yes
I think at a high level when you see the 8.8% global growth in molecular, we continue to feel very good both domestically and really internationally and a lot of that is -- frankly, it's all the core business
It's the women's health assays
Internationally the virals are starting to contribute Jack, but there is still a very small and we've got a few ancillary assays here and there
But, for the most part, it is our core women's health assays driving the growth
I think we have been very pleased with what our team had already done by stopping the declines of NovaSure and trying to get into a modest growth business before the competitive withdrawal
We have clearly benefited for the last almost four quarters from a competitive withdraw that's inflated those growth rates
But, we still think it can be a growth business
And MyoSure as well continues to probably defy a lot of expectation
So, we continue to be very, very encouraged by what this business can do
Now, after eight straight quarters of double-digit growth, certainly that the comps and the stacked comps and everything else continue to get tougher and tougher
But, we feel good about where the business is going and good about the international opportunity and good about the fact that we are just launching NovaSure Advance that will bring some new life into the franchise
Having said all of that, we are clearly assuming a return to single-digit growth here as we go into the second half of the year and probably a more modest growth rate from what we have been able to achieve
Hey, thanks Vijay
I think we are going to continue to look at the assets
There is so much uncertainty now certainly around whether it's tax rates around everything else
We are going to continue to look at everything on its own merits and continue to be very disciplined in what we are looking at
But, we have the money, it doesn't mean we are going to rush out and spend it
Sure, Tycho
As we said, earlier on diagnostics and surgical probably leading the growth internationally given the fact they are more direct than dealer
Having said that, we are seeing some pockets of building and even our European Breast Health business, where we have put a new leader in place nine or ten months ago we are starting to see some better results there
But you also have other businesses like Latin America that are little more fluctuating
So I think as we look fundamentally, we feel the business getting stronger and I think it will slowly start to tick up over the course of this year
Yes, it's probably going to be more 2018, 2019 before it can hit more of a stride
And again, just as we work through dealer issues and other things
But, feel we are definitely on the right path and making good progress
Yes
I think we probably took our eye off of the ball just a little bit
We have been continuing to evolve the sales organization in the U.S
And frankly, it sold in conjunction in a lot of cases with our Breast Health portfolio
As we launch our firm and have the managers focused on other new products, I think we would probably took our eye a little bit off the ball on staying as focused is also a little bit of competitive activity in the see arm space
But, in general I think just we reported as a segment but it is managed more as a product line to some degree and a relatively small one and just didn't -- haven't delivered for the last couple of quarters
So, but we feel good, the order trends were starting to pick up here
Thanks Tycho
Isaac, our first assumption whenever we are doing reasonably well is always that the market is doing well
Sometimes after the fact that it actually looks like share has been -- has helped
I mean clearly Roche continues to do well
They are a very strong player
We think we have certainly done okay
But the market was probably half of this in last quarter, we don't have complete visibility but I would always rather assume, it was that then be taking credit for share
I always look to come out after the fact as you know, the same with Genius 3D
Sure, the highest level I put the – that we do have the team in place now we added our final addition was a Head of Corporate Business Development and I liking it a lot of what we've done internationally with our leaders that over the course of the last year, we put the foundations in place, we put the right people in place
That I do think we’re in good place to execute on deals now
Each division has a very good business development lead and then we’ve got the resource at corporate
So we’ve quietly been building that up and we’ve looked at a lot of deals and I’ve learned long ago from my mentor at Stryker, John Brown
In most cases, the best decision on business development is no, and we'll continue to be very disciplined, but the flow and the amount of time that certainly Bob and I've spent on deals over the last six months much, much better
And I think as we sit here, I probably will be surprised if 12 months from now if we haven't some something, but continuing to stay focused
And to your second point, ROIC is going to continue to be the key part and then ultimately we’ll launch something that is top-line and bottom-line accretive in growth rate for the company
So we'll be looking at things that could accelerate our top and bottom-line growth, not just up for example that would make us bigger
But at the end of the day, it's going to be about both growth rate and ROIC will be the big things we will be looking at as well as obviously being able to leverage our existing channels is always going to be kind of the first port of call
I think the first part in terms of our firm, I think we feel very good about each of our products continuing to build momentum
And I think as we said about things like a firm, the firms going to add to our growth here in 2017. It will be bigger in 2018 than it will be in 2017, it will be probably even bigger in 2019 than it is in 2018. So I think we're in the early stages of all of these launches like virals like a firm and then things that will be coming on behind these
So feeling good about that
In terms of the leverage, I think one of the more obvious paths we’ve been able to leverage is in Genius 3D mammography for example where we’ve been able to detail to OB/GYNs that we have this technology
And in the past all we did is call on radiology
So we are looking and there are opportunities where sales forces are at least talking about some of the other products in our portfolio
And we're looking for them where they opportunistically exist
We’re not forcing synergies where they don't exist
Yes
What we also like to as you look forward in terms of our diagnostics business, which is on the molecular side and also the cytology side and then you've got an imaging side
As we look at where science is going the ability to have people that have some general expertise in different modalities of diagnostics across women's health, we think ultimately there are some opportunities that may play out deeper into the future
Sure, Doug
I think the highest level in terms of the U.S
, lot of our customers we actually have sort of standing orders every month and the extra days didn't have as much of an impact as we probably would have thought
We traditionally do very little business in that week between Christmas and New Year
So, it helped a little bit
It would have been nice to help more maybe, but again I think a fairly light week
Internationally, Panther placements I think continue to be probably the single biggest driver, utilization is starting to get up, but we're definitely getting some new customer wins that's starting to drive that
There is not pull forward I can promise you that
I think it's our toughest comp
I think we're going to easier comps in the third and fourth quarters
So it's a little bit below our annual guidance, but…
Yes
That business is becoming a bigger chunk
It probably is a little bit more pronounced
We've got the right leaders in place
We're investing in people -- adding sales people were needed and all of that, but we're all self funding effectively that and just being rigorous like we are in every decision we make add few, so we're not coming out and saying hey, we're going to take a quarter or a year half while we make investments
We're self funding those as things take off in one market, we'll add some reps for example in another market and build it that way
So, I think we feel good, overall to your second part of that question, profitability internationally is lower
We typically on a margin basis, we typically have a combination of factors from some lower selling prices, we're also by the way because we produced a lot of our products in the U.S, the strong dollar is not – not our friend as it relates to international margin
And also going through dealers particularly in the Breast Health, all of those serve to depress the gross margin, which therefore as our business continues to grow and international picks up, the ability for that much more expansion of gross margin starts to moderate
Sure, Anthony
On the Genius placements, we only provide the numbers on an annualized basis, so we did that at the end of last quarter
We don't provide quarterly numbers
Having said that, it grew modestly in the U.S
this quarter versus the same quarter last year, so continuing to grow
And on the share front, I think we continue to feel good that we are probably punching above our weight and continue to feel good about what we're doing in terms of market share gains there
Yes, Ravi
We'll take the last one first and our flu related assets are very small, so that's our -- not a real impact for us
I would say I guess on the converts, there are certain limitations if you would go out and privately negotiate those creeping tender rolls and so forth it depends on
It also depends on whether the -- the holders are willing to sell
So that would happen overtime, but again within 12 months those things are all going to be callable
And the last one I think was around skeletal and underperformance there
When I can't sell a business because it had one or two quarters of underperformance we think -- first thing is, let's fix it, we're not going to sell it in that
And the other thing is, it does have -- it's fairly integrated into our breast and skeletal -- our breast business especially around the service component and so we've got a large installed base as well as the service tax out in the field that can service both our products
So it's probably more integrated actually than even the blood business that we do just recently divested
Hi, Derik
Sure, Derik
I think as it relates to cytology, the way we think about it is, flattish in the U.S
is probably about as good as, as we could expect for sometime here and as we continue to offset the extension of the intervals with our own share gains
We still do think there is opportunities outside the United States, significant opportunities that is going to be a longer term build
But when you look at the presence of liquid base cytology outside the U.S
it's still underdeveloped
So there we think we do have some opportunities
On the perinatal piece, I would say we've got our own clinical programs and it maybe more indication related or other things that we're looking at, but we realized we've got a nice little perinatal business and a dedicated sales team there
So there are maybe some opportunities to try to drive that business, that's one of the smaller businesses that we've quietly refocused on a little bit internally so you don't forget about it and starting to feel there are maybe some opportunities for us in the coming years
