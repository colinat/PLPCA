0,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone"
1,We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
2,We posted strong results overall with revenue exceeding our guidance and earnings per share finishing at the high end of our expectations
3,And we redeployed more than $300 million of capital to buy back shares and retire convertible notes
4,Our fourth quarter results capped off a very productive fiscal 2017.
5,"Over the last 12 months, we made excellent progress toward building a sustainable growth company with emphasis on that word sustainable"
6,"In the short term, we delivered solid mid single digit revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, as we said we would at the beginning of the year"
7,"But at the same time, we took three important steps to solidify our growth profile for the long term"
8,"First, we laid the foundations for sustainable growth internationally"
9,"Second, we shifted our business portfolio toward higher growth segments with the divestiture of blood screening and the acquisition of Cynosure"
10,"And third, we began to launch new products that reflect increasing innovation from our revitalized research and development pipeline"
11,"In short, 2017 was a year in which we delivered on our near-term financial commitments and did what we said we would do to build sustainable long-term growth"
12,"With that introduction, let's review our fourth quarter results"
13,Revenue of $802.9 million grew 10.5% on a reported basis or 9.9% in constant currency
14,"Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.0% or 4.4% in constant currency, as all our legacy divisions grew on a global basis"
15,"We are pleased with this solid mid single digit growth rate on the top line, which represents sequential acceleration compared to the 3.1% growth we posted in the third quarter"
16,"One factor underpinning this acceleration is growing sales of new products, which totaled more than $50 million in the quarter, nearly five times the level of a year ago"
17,"Obviously, this is not all incremental growth, but the rejuvenation of our product portfolio bodes well for the future"
18,"In terms of geography, international sales drove most of the growth in the fourth quarter"
19,"revenue of $189.9 million increased 24.7%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure"
20,"Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased a robust 17.5% as a result of very focused and deliberate efforts that began with new leadership less than two years ago"
21,"Reflecting back on early 2016, we described our international businesses as a start-up, and this was a major concern among investors and analysts, one that dominated our conversations with many of you"
22,"By the first quarter of 2017, the international business grew mid single digits"
23,"One quarter after that, it grew double digits"
24,"And this quarter, it grew 17.5%"
25,"So while we thought that international would be a double-digit grower by 2018, we've actually delivered on that promise a year earlier than anticipated"
26,"Yes, we achieved double digit international growth in fiscal 2017."
27,"We hope you remember this success story, a complex one that occurred across divisions and geographies, as you think about the more straightforward efforts we have underway today to build a stronger, better Cynosure 2.0."
28,We'll talk more about these in a moment
29,"In terms of divisional performance in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that growth accelerated in our two largest businesses, Breast Health and Diagnostics, compared to the third quarter"
30,"In addition, we believe that Cynosure sales bottomed out and should start to grow on a sequential basis from here"
31,"Growth slowed in surgical, but Skeletal reversed recent trends and posted very good results"
32,Now let us provide a little more detail on each of these divisions
33,Diagnostics has clearly emerged as a sustainable growth driver for the company
34,"In the fourth quarter, excluding the divested blood screening franchise, we posted sales of $273.7 million, an increase of 6.6%"
35,This compares favorably to the 5.4% growth we posted in the third quarter
36,"Fueling this growth again was molecular diagnostics, where sales of $153.5 million increased 13.8%"
37,Molecular sales did benefit from $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior-year period
38,"But if you back out all these royalties, underlying molecular sales still increased 10.9% globally"
39,"The business was also very strong internationally, posting growth of 10.3% against a very tough prior year comparable of roughly 15%"
40,This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth for molecular internationally
41,"Global growth was driven by the Panther system, our fully automated molecular diagnostics instruments"
42,"By the end of 2017, we had shipped about 1,300 Panthers to diagnostics customers with about 800 of these in the United States"
43,"Importantly, we actually shipped slightly more Panther systems in 2017, the seventh year after our launch, than we did a year ago"
44,This illustrates the strength of our competitive position and bodes well for future growth
45,"Based on increasing usage of our Aptima women's health assays and our growing menu of virology tests, the average Panther system generated more than $200,000 of assay revenue on a global basis in 2017, nearly a high single-digit increase in utilization per system compared to the prior year"
46,And we expect further improvement in utilization in the future based in part on new assays that will emerge from an R&D pipeline that is healthier and more global than it's ever been
47,"For example, in recent weeks, we received FDA clearance for the first two respiratory assays that will run on our revolutionary new Panther Fusion system"
48,"Before we leave diagnostics, we want to mention that while sales of cytology and perinatal products declined slightly to $120.2 million in the fourth quarter, this was mainly due to lower perinatal sales"
49,"Sales of cytology products, mainly our ThinPrep liquid Pap test, increased at a low single digit rate as strong international growth offset modest declines in the U.S"
50,"We also want to mention that we've been encouraged to see various professional societies and patient groups speak out against the draft USPSTF cervical cancer screening guidelines, which represent bad science"
51,"Although primary HPV testing has been FDA-approved for three years, it is rarely used in the United States as studies have shown it can miss nearly 20% of cervical cancers, reversing decades of progress we've made against the disease"
52,"As a result, we do not expect these draft USPSTF guidelines will have much effect on our business in the near term"
53,"Instead, we believe that co-testing for cervical cancer will remain the gold standard"
54,Now let's turn to Breast Health
55,"As foreshadowed in our August call, several encouraging signs had begun to emerge in this business last quarter, ranging from new products to new indications to increased insurance coverage"
56,"And in the fourth quarter, these positive factors continued to build, helping us regain market momentum and extend our leadership position"
57,"Global Breast Health sales totaled $300.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.4% compared to the prior-year period and a sequential acceleration compared to the 0.9% growth we saw in the third quarter"
58,"business declined 1.2%, although this was largely due to a tough comp in the prior-year period, when sales increased at a high single-digit rate"
59,"International sales grew a strong 20.6%, reflecting the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means"
60,"For all of those who have been concerned about a potential cliff in domestic 3D placements, our results this quarter further prove that we have broken that boom-and-bust cycle based on strategic plans we put in place years ago"
61,"In the United States, we had a record quarter of 3D shipments, again, exceeding the 300 mark, based on strong initial uptake of our recently launched 3Dimensions and 3D Performance systems"
62,"In addition, we continued to gain market share and our backlog increased, which bodes well for future growth"
63,"Importantly, although we have now sold roughly 4,700 3D units in the United States, this still represents just over half of our own installed base"
64,"And MQSA data statistics suggest that 3D still represents well less than half the overall market, so we still have many quarters of solid performance ahead of us"
65,"At the same time, other growth drivers continue to emerge in Breast Health"
66,"In the fourth quarter, service revenue again exceeded $100 million and grew at a mid-single-digit rate"
67,Sales of our Affirm prone table increased nicely
68,"And we also launched Brevera, our revolutionary new real-time biopsy system, which should contribute to growth in 2018."
69,"Now let's turn to Surgical, where sales of $104.7 million increased 2.7%, slower growth than we had seen in recent quarters"
70,"MyoSure continued to perform well, with sales increasing 17%"
71,"And we recently launched MyoSure MANUAL, which will help us penetrate the growing in-office market"
72,"NovaSure sales declined 7.2% due to a number of factors, including the annualization of a competitive withdrawal, increasing competition, and some softness in overall surgical volumes"
73,"Although our skeletal business is small, we were pleased to see it reverse recent trends and return to growth in the fourth quarter, driven by better portfolio selling, strong performance from our Horizon bone densitometry system, and stabilization of our Fluoroscan franchise"
74,"Skeletal sales totaled $24.2 million, an increase of 12.9%"
75,Now let me discuss our new Medical Aesthetics division
76,Cynosure sales were $81.4 million in the quarter
77,"As expected, this was down significantly from the prior-year period, when Cynosure was standalone company"
78,"We estimate that the two hurricanes in the southern United States reduced Cynosure sales by $3 million to $4 million in the quarter, as sales events were canceled and purchase decisions were delayed"
79,"We want to make two big-picture points about Cynosure that are very different than today's prevailing discourse among investors and analysts, but they illustrate how we're building this business for the long term and why we are confident that we will succeed and grow in Medical Aesthetics"
80,"First, we'd like to remind you why we bought Cynosure in the first place"
81,"Medical aesthetics is a great growth market, one of the best in med-tech"
82,"By divesting blood screening, where volumes and price are declining and purchasing Cynosure, we fundamentally shifted our portfolio toward higher-growth segments"
83,"The many tailwinds boosting Cynosure's market include increasing social acceptance of aesthetic procedures, high levels of disposable income among patients, decreasing reimbursement for physicians that is prompting interest in cash-pay services, improving treatments that minimize patient downtime, and growing interest among younger women as well as men"
84,These tailwinds have been driving market growth rates in the high single to low double-digit range
85,"Our second point is that we are making good progress toward building what we call Cynosure 2.0, which we expect to include the greatest commercial organization that the laser industry has ever seen"
86,"This is a bullish comment, especially in contrast to recent results"
87,"But we want you to know that our goals are high, and we intend to achieve them"
88,"This process starts with great leadership, just as it did with our international business in 2016."
89,We have already put in place outstanding leaders as Cynosure's President and the heads of sales and marketing
90,We have stopped the voluntary turnover in the field and rehired a handful of high-performing reps
91,"We've instituted new screening and recruiting methods to ensure that new hires share our commitment and values to winning as a team, to winning the right way, and to winning in partnership with our customers over the long term"
92,"We have upgraded our structure and compensation programs to ensure that sales reps have the ability to prosper by selling our entire portfolio, which is the broadest in our industry"
93,We've hired new leaders to revitalize the customer experience and build the same kind of customer loyalty that we see in our other divisions
94,And we are implementing across the division a robust sales model that has been proven to work by Cynosure's best reps
95,"Based on all these factors, we're confident that Cynosure's sales bottomed in the fourth quarter and are poised to grow from here"
96,"Not only will we execute better with our existing portfolio of products, we will effectively launch new products such as the submental indication for SculpSure, which is receiving positive early feedback from customers"
97,"While we still have a ton of work to do, we are making good progress"
98,"As early indicators of this, our international performance remains solid and some domestic sales regions are performing very well"
99,"And overall, sales so far this quarter are tracking ahead of their pace in the fourth quarter"
100,"We are confident that Cynosure will make steady progress in the coming quarters, like our international business did, and become an important growth driver for the company in 2018 and beyond, like our international business is today"
101,"Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we posted a very good fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off a productive fiscal year"
102,"Not only did we execute against our short-term financial commitments, we made important progress in building a sustainable growth company for the long term by growing international, strengthening our portfolio of businesses and launching new products"
103,"I am proud of our team and all that we have accomplished together, and am eager to drive even greater successes in 2018 and beyond"
104,Now I'll hand the call over to Bob
105,"Yes, why it declined sequentially, if you'll recall, Isaac, we basically changed out the whole leadership team in the July-August time period"
106,So we gave them one quarter after we did the acquisition
107,"Obviously, it wasn't our shining moment, and then we put the new team in"
108,"And during the new team, obviously, a little bit more transition"
109,"But I will tell you, we also, as you know, we had said we expected a fairly significant decline in the quarter"
110,"It was probably a little worse, candidly, than what we would have hoped"
111,"But I'll tell you, having just spent a lot of time with their sales organization, their leaders over the last couple of weeks, it's a very different place than it was even 30 â€"
112,“ 45 days ago
113,"And so I feel very good about where we're headed, and I feel very confident that we can now declare the bottom, and it's going to get stronger and stronger from here"
114,"Sure, great question, Isaac"
115,And I'd clarify a couple of additions to that
116,"One is we did just get the submental approved right at the end of the quarter, so that will be kicking in for this quarter"
117,We have the RF platform that we've talked about
118,"That is very much on schedule, and I think you will likely see that being launched in early calendar year 2018."
119,And it's very important to note that all the leaders in the R&D organization and all the managers are all intact
120,"So the inside of the company has not been affected, while the outside of the salesforce in the U.S"
121,"So we have a lot of pockets and stability called the international selling organization, but particularly the R&D organization, very intact"
122,It's a big part of what we loved about this business
123,"They've been great innovators for a long time, and we expect to continue that pace of innovation"
124,"Hey, Jack"
125,"I think clearly, to your point, we saw pockets of strength"
126,Our West Coast team was largely intact and has delivered actually growth in the quarter
127,"What we had is we had several teams that largely left en masse when the transition occurred, and it's filling those pockets back up"
128,But we know how to do that
129,We're frankly being â€
130,“ we're building for the long haul
131,We could have easily gone out and just grabbed a bunch of people that had left and offered them a bunch of money like this industry
132,"typically does just to bring them back, but we're building it for the long haul"
133,So I think what we feel really good about now
134,is we've looked at what has made the regions that are successful doing well and really starting to emulate and pick up from there as we add the people
135,But this is going to be like international
136,I know everybody wants to see the immediate turnaround
137,"To build things sustainably, it takes a period of quarters"
138,We could easily do a one-hit wonder and go out and just hire some people and slam some stuff through
139,It's not what we're about
140,We didn't buy this business for 2017.
141,We didn't buy it for the beginning of 2018.
142,We are building it
143,And I've got so much confidence in the leaders that we have in place now
144,"And it's a combination of some from the outside and frankly, a lot of real stars that were in the company that are stepping up in the company, being Cynosure, stepping up"
145,So that will give us the sequential improvement
146,"There's just little doubt in our minds that we bottomed out, and we'll build from here"
147,"Thank you, Tycho"
148,"Sure, at the highest level, Tycho, I feel a lot better about where our Breast Health business is headed as we go into 2018 than probably did going into 2017, and certainly materially better than how we felt six months ago"
149,I think our team has gotten their mojo back
150,And the two new products are really going to help us a lot
151,What we're seeing is 3Dimensions on the high end is coming off to a very nice reception
152,And the 3D Performance is probably going to be a little bit bigger than I think a number of our reps felt
153,And that is going to be at a lower price
154,"But having said that, it's similar margin to our existing business"
155,The greatest part about that is it's allowing us to compete
156,"As you know, some of the big boys are being very aggressive on price"
157,We don't want to get into a price battle
158,"But it does give us a chance to have an offering for some of the smaller hospitals where they don't need all the bells and whistles that come in our traditional Dimensions, you know, 6000, 9000 and then the 3Dimensions"
159,So it really gives us a very good menu of an offering
160,"And I think that really, we already saw a nice uptick there in the fourth quarter in terms of placements"
161,We've also got Brevera coming
162,"And frankly, if I look at, we don't report orders"
163,But it was a very nice uptick in our fourth quarter orders
164,And I think just there's a lot of things coming together in that business right now
165,"As you know, we've come a long way and just avoiding the cliff"
166,It's not going to be a super growth business in the U.S
167,just given how far we've come
168,"Having said that, internationally, internationally is looking very, very good"
169,"and you can see the numbers there, 20%-ish Breast Health growth internationally"
170,"And everybody â€“ remember, a big part of that growth is Kevin Thornal, who was redeployed to Cynosure"
171,"And his first few quarters internationally looked pretty ugly and today, we're in a very different place"
172,"And it's what gives me tremendous confidence both about our ongoing Breast Health business, our international business, but also Cynosure"
173,I'll answer the second half of the question first
174,"No, we won't have any impact this year on Fusion on the flu season"
175,It just came a little bit late and we still have one more assay that we want to prove
176,I think it does bode well for next year's flu season
177,I think the initial feedback from Fusion has been phenomenal
178,And the magic to me is the fact that we did placed more systems in 2017 than we did in 2016.
179,"And it's too early to fully predict an attach rate, but we think it will be very high"
180,And we're seeing just increased throughput
181,Everybody that gets Panther into their hands likes it
182,And Fusion is that much more of a game changer
183,"So over time, we would certainly expect the majority of those and hopefully, as we get well into 2018 and beyond, hopefully most of the systems we ship will actually be Panther Fusions as opposed to Panthers"
184,"But we'll be basically taking it on a case-by-case basis, whatever is best for our customers"
185,But I think they'll increasingly see the broader value of Fusion as well
186,"Sure, Dan, good question"
187,We continue to feel great about MyoSure
188,and it continues to grow at rates far beyond what we probably would have predicted
189,We're a little disappointed with NovaSure
190,"Obviously, there was the competitive"
191,We had done a great job turning that business around
192,Then we benefited from the competitive withdrawal
193,But I think we might have taken it little easy
194,Maybe that business came a little too easy to us
195,And I don't think we've doubled down as firmly as we need to
196,We have put a new sales leader and some new leadership into that division to kind of step it up a little bit
197,And we're looking at some comp changes for that salesforce
198,"And I think I put them a little bit of where our Breast Health business was about six months ago where I think they just slightly took their foot off the pedal, and we're are going to get that foot back on the pedal"
199,"Sure, we are well below where they were a year ago, and particularly in some key regions"
200,So consider that double digit percentages down
201,"And that's where I think as we start to add bodies back into a lot of these territories, and we're doing that now, that that will drive some very nice growth"
202,But we are materially below where they were at this time last year
203,"Sure, Chris"
204,"No real change in the competitive dynamics, I think"
205,"We lost, as we were down people, we've got to put territories back in"
206,"There's always little pieces in that business where one company might get a little hotter for a quarter or two, but nothing fundamentally different"
207,"Yeah, I think, hiring is not complete"
208,We're hiring as we speak
209,"And we've got some just great leaders in that business that are talent magnets, so filling those spots"
210,But I think they will be filling through time
211,We'll start to see some growth here in the coming quarters
212,and I think builds sequentially through the year
213,I think it will be a big driver of growth in the second half of the year for us
214,Down versus year ago but up sequentially
215,"Hey, Raj"
216,I figured you'd come with Breast Health
217,"You know what, I'll say no, and we believe that"
218,"Ultimately, I believe you hire great people who can work hard and outwork others, you will win over time"
219,"I think all of you know, the medical aesthetics industry has been probably not quite of the same character and values"
220,We think we can do it
221,and we can do it the right way
222,"It may not be as easy, but there is zero doubt in my mind that we can do it"
223,"And I'll tell you, the existing Cynosure sales leaders who stayed with us"
224,", it's what they want"
225,"And frankly, there's a lot that the Hologic name is going to bring to this space that will play out over time"
226,"It may not be playing out in the first three, six, nine months"
227,"But what we can do for this industry, and I always believe ultimately, you do what's right for the customers, you hire great people and you treat them right and build a more enduring relationship, it will prevail"
228,And that's what we're setting out to do
229,"And again, you may not always see it in the short term, right, it's like athletes can win doing steroids or other things"
230,"But ultimately, who is the enduring winner are going to be that people do it right"
231,"And that's exactly what we're out to do, and we will do it"
232,"It's not a barrier to hiring quality people, let me be really clear about that"
233,There's lot of quality people who want to come in
234,It's just not necessarily people with a ton of industry experience
235,We are getting very good quality people
236,"And I think we see this being back to a double-digit grower in 2018, Raj"
237,"So we will deliver that, and therefore it will be accretive to our company growth rate"
238,"Yes, go ahead Bob"
239,"I think in simple terms, given the growth rate of our molecular business, we're probably not going to go in it assay by assay, but we think they are growing faster than the market and taking market share, particularly in the U.S"
240,", but also reasonably encouraged obviously off a much a smaller base internationally"
241,"Yes, thanks, David"
242,I think you're exactly right
243,And we won't be silly to chase that to an extreme
244,But I think what we're seeing is there are more synergies
245,say on the operational side
246,"and maybe some on the G&A side while we reinvest in sales, marketing, and R&D"
247,So we're probably getting that accretion in a different way than we might have anticipated
248,"But if we feel we need to spend a little bit more than the base business is delivering, we would certainly contemplate that"
249,"Yes, yes"
250,"Hi, Rich"
251,"Yes, thanks"
252,We still think there's big opportunities on the body contouring side
253,"In the grand scheme, while there's been competitors and products out for five or six years, when you look at the full range of possibilities in the installed base, there's still a lot of opportunity there"
254,"On the women's health side, we also think there's much better opportunities, particularly for MonaLisa Touch in women's health than, frankly, what Cynosure had done over its last year as a standalone company and probably what we've done in the first quarter and a half"
255,", two quarters of owning it"
256,And we're putting a more dedicated effort into particularly the women's health side
257,So we also want to be careful not to distract our Surgical organization because they've got two great products and still a lot of growth potential as well
258,So it's like anything
259,"You find other ways, and I think frankly, it's going to be more through the Cynosure sales organization with a refocus on the opportunity"
260,"No, we're still using referrals"
261,"What I'd say, our basic approach here is use the GYN Surgical salesforce for referrals to key customers, but have the Cynosure sales reps still close them, but I think building that relationship to be better"
262,"Sure, we think we're probably still a few years away from that"
263,"And the magic of it, to your point, is we think we've still got probably three to four years of runway with tomo itself still establishing itself into our customers that haven't flipped yet"
264,"And by that point, we'll be needing some new revenue and then the early adopters will be starting to come up and it'll probably work out very well that they'll be ready for some new stuff, call it in that 2020-2021 time period"
265,"So it should really be key to helping us break this whole boom/bust cycle that really, when you look at it, and I go back two years ago, every meeting we had with investors was about the cliff"
266,"And then shortly after that, every meeting was about international"
267,"Right now, everyone is about Cynosure"
268,We just keep knocking it up
269,"There's issues that pop up, very proud of what we've done to thwart off the cliff"
270,very proud of what we've done in international
271,"And frankly, we'll be sitting here 12 months from now having shown the same with Cynosure, feel very confident about it"
272,"I go back to my, probably my core management philosophy"
273,The reason I feel better is because of the team that we have in place
274,"And we have a better, more engaged leadership team, then the regional leaders under them are strong and motivated"
275,And they lost their way for a little bit earlier this year
276,"There's always recency effect, but I was just with the entire sales organization a couple of weeks ago for their national sales meeting"
277,"Just hearing comments like, hey, this place is even completely different than it was 30 days ago"
278,We're jazzed
279,We're ready to go
280,And it's the leading qualitative factor
281,"And this is where I'll go back to, I think you've heard me say it, sometimes an organization is better than its numbers and sometimes it's worse than its numbers"
282,"And I think, but oftentimes, when you're in the midst of changing something out, you can start to see it and feel it qualitatively before the numbers start to show up"
283,"Having said that, we are partway into this quarter and we're starting to see some uptick"
284,So I don't want to get into the process of talking about quarterly updates
285,"But because this call is particularly later into a quarter, starting to feel certainly on a better trajectory than where we've been"
