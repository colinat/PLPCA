0,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone"
1,"As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations"
2,"We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million, due primarily to our better financial performance"
3,"As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high 20% range, with the fourth quarter, therefore, comprising a percentage in the high-teens, as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season"
4,I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance
5,"Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations"
6,"And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pre-tax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range"
7,"Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development"
8,We're also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member per month basis
9,"Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance"
10,"Turning to our other businesses, our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year and, as a result, we raised our pre-tax target by approximately $20 million at the midpoint of the guidance range"
11,The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations
12,"We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to midsize employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital"
13,"The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent and, importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines"
14,"Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated"
15,"In addition, while to-date, mail order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new standalone PDP members appear to be lower utilizers of mail-order relative to historical experience"
16,"Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pre-tax than anticipated"
17,"As a result of these items, we have reduced our pre-tax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million at the midpoint of our guidance range"
18,"To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pre-tax income will more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments, due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share"
19,"These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers, and the company"
20,"To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance"
21,Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pre-tax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million
22,"These results reflect significant positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of a 2016 two hours (16:48) of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business"
23,The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy
24,"This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break"
25,"In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period"
26,"Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others"
27,We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company
28,"As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint"
29,"Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings in our Medicare bids for 2018, we reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year"
30,We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members
31,"In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are record-high levels"
32,"It is, nonetheless, important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations"
33,"Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018."
34,"With regards to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the non-deductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly"
35,We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018.
36,The process transformation office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes
37,"Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018."
38,"When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth"
39,"It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high-end given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned"
40,"Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans"
41,"As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter"
42,"Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization"
43,"Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations"
44,"As discussed at our Investor Day, our capacity for cash M&A is approximately $3.5 billion while allowing us to maintain our investment-grade ratings"
45,"With that, we will open the lines up for your questions"
46,"In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question"
47,"Operator, please introduce the first caller"
48,Question-and-Answer Session
49,"Good morning, Scott"
50,I would say that what we've seen is consistent with where we expected on both fronts â€“ on both the low-income benchmarks as well as our direct subsidy calculations
51,"And as the fall goes on, obviously, we'll talk more about what that means for us in our membership growth"
52,Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
53,LLC
54,Okay
55,"Then just had a follow-up question, just on thinking about sort of the comments you made on investing for 2018 into the MA business on the upside and then given the improvements that you had on Stars in terms of the mitigation efforts"
56,"I know in the first quarter, you guys have talked about a view of MA industry growth running around the 6% range sort of over the next few years"
57,How are you thinking about your ability to sort of return to that type of growth rate next year given some of the recent developments?
58,"Well, as I said in my remarks, we do expect to grow meaningfully in the individual MA business"
59,We're not prepared to comment today on where that will be relative to the market
60,"But again, I think we feel very good about the product we've put on the Street"
61,"We've really endeavored to maintain stable benefits, and we think it will be compelling products for our existing members and also future members looking to enter MA"
62,So there's a lot to unpack in that question
63,"It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee"
64,"Obviously, it's going to vary by market"
65,"But on a national basis, I think that's a fair way to think about it"
66,It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design
67,"But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, the 100 basis points, that was reinvested into our product design"
68,Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more one-time items
69,"And so, I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance"
70,"And finally, as it relates to the HIF"
71,"Remember, the HIF is coming back next year"
72,And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits
73,It's just that we didn't have to claw it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017.
74,"So again, I think it's important as we think about 2018, and I don't want to comment too much more on 2018, but to think about a baseline of $11 because we've invested this outperformance"
75,"We mentioned that in the first quarter, we would do that"
76,We thought it was the appropriate thing to do to provide good benefits for our members and enable us to grow
77,"And again, we feel good about where we stand"
78,We do anticipate growing EPS
79,"We've committed to our investors that we're going to have steady EPS growth, and that's certainly our intention next year as well as grow membership"
80,So I'll go there first
81,It will be seamless for the member as it relates to the contract consolidation
82,So that won't be an issue in terms of the member
83,won't see that consolidation
84,"With respect to the EPS, I think it's important to use $11 as the baseline"
85,"And we hope to â€“ obviously, our plan is to grow that number, and our expectation it would be above the $11.50 as well, but $11 is the baseline"
86,"And so as we think about growth rates, I think that's the way you should be thinking about 2018."
87,So I'm not prepared to comment on where we'll be on EPS growth because that would be giving guidance for 2018.
88,"We're trying to help you and give you context about how we're thinking about the year, but really not prepared to give specifics"
89,I think what we try to communicate this morning is that we feel good about the product we're putting out for our members that will enable us to grow membership
90,And we also believe when combined with trend benders and some of the productivity initiatives we're working through will enable us to grow EPS in a steady way
91,"So I appreciate the question, but obviously, we're not prepared to give 2018 guidance"
92,"What I will say is that it is true, as we articulated that we came into the year a little bit below our margin expectation, our long-term margin target"
93,"It's fair to say with this outperformance that we are above our margin target, and it's fair to say that our long-term target remains 4.5% to 5% on a pre-tax basis"
94,"But beyond that, I don't want to comment any further"
95,"Well, first of all, at the Investor Day, we talked about long-term growing at or above the market"
96,"We didn't comment on 2018, and I would just leave it at that"
97,"It's too early, really, to see what our competitors have done"
98,"The data still isn't out there broadly, and it's something we'll be analyzing in the coming months"
99,"But we're obviously, as an organization, gearing up for AEP, and we feel good about how we're positioned"
100,So â€
101,"“ good morning, Peter â€"
102,“ we did know our Stars scores before we submitted our bids
103,So our bids incorporate the 74%
104,"Well, again, what we've said is we're able to keep benefits stable and competitive and"
105,"so we'll see where it shakes out, but we feel good about how we're positioned"
106,"Well, again, I think that's why we're being cautious"
107,We don't know where our competitors are
108,"As I said on a national basis, we're stable"
109,I think there are clearly markets where we believe we can grow and we invested in and there are markets where perhaps we're not as well-positioned and we didn't invest as much
110,"So we were, I think, very strategic about where we put our investments and our dollars to be able to maximize growth and offer compelling product for our members"
111,But it is too early to assess where we are relative to our competition
112,"But as Bruce said, we're working every angle and possibility we can to enhance growth including distribution"
113,"So again, we feel good about where we are"
114,We'll obviously know more in the coming months as we see how we're positioned relative to our peers
115,"So, that's definitely more than one question"
116,"We'll try to answer it, A"
117,"So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking about in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and specifically our dental business which has been outperforming"
118,It's not something that we're prepared to quantify
119,but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about
120,"but as I think done very, very nicely, membership higher than we expected as well as better claims experience"
121,"Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization as we called it and the mail-order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments"
122,"On the optimization side, as we said for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time"
123,And that the right interventions are happening
124,"And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services"
125,", that's a member we won't touch as many times"
126,And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care
127,"And so we continued to see very good results, where the member is getting the right level of care and that's where we're focused"
128,"But that does have a pre-tax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges, to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pre-tax associated with that because there's a margin there"
129,"And so again, I think that's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and more importantly for our members and their clinical health"
130,"On the specialty side, on the specialty â€“ sorry, the pharmacy side, the mail-order side, what we're referring to there is our mail-order rate and, as I mentioned in our low price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail-order rate than we had anticipated"
131,We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that maybe causing some of those members to fulfill â€“ to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail
132,"But again, overall, it's a â€"
133,"“ there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works when someone fills at retail"
134,And then finally â€
135,"“ and I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities"
136,We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out
137,We're analyzing that
138,and I'll just leave it at that
139,But it doesn't fundamentally change our strategy in the home and being able to engage with our members in a much more significant way in the home
140,"Well, it's something obviously"
141,we do a lot of work around to try to understand what are the major drivers
142,"We're clearly seeing the success of our clinical programs and some of our operational initiatives, what we call, trend benders"
143,We are seeing an important advancement of our strategy there
144,"and we think that is why we're beating our operational targets, particularly on the inpatient side"
145,"On the pharmacy side, it's something that we continue to look through"
146,I think â€
147,“ look at â€
148,“ I think we're seeing slightly lower trend than we had expected
149,I think that's really the major driver
150,"There may be some mix issues there as well in the membership that we have, but it's something that we continue to analyze"
151,"And as we think about 2018, obviously, as we mentioned, we've reinvested those â€“ that outperformance into our â€“ in our bid design, we're obviously cautious about certain trends and whether they will continue"
152,And so we're very mindful of trends that might continue and trends that might not continue
153,"And so we, obviously, do a lot of analytics, a lot of actuaries working in figuring that out"
154,So I think what we put into our benefit design for 2018
155,we feel good about
156,"Well, it's fair to say that when we are in a full risk arrangement with a provider, they'll obviously get the financial benefits from that"
157,About one-third of our members are in full risk arrangements
158,The other two-thirds are not
159,"About 65%, including that 33%, are in some form of a value-based arrangement where we share in some of those savings"
160,I think it's fair to say that everyone benefits when admissions go down
161,"Obviously, most importantly, our members benefit and so that's where we're focused"
162,"But also, from a financial perspective, we want our providers to do well and have strong financial performance because that enables us to demonstrate to other providers who are thinking about taking risk with us that there are opportunities to do very well there"
163,"And so really, everyone benefits when we're able to drive down medical costs and admissions"
164,"As it relates to the Stars impact, it really has a similar impact"
165,"Depending on the arrangement that you're in, the provider will get a higher portion of dollars just because there's more premium going through the system"
166,"And if they get a percentage of premium, they're going to get more premiums"
167,So they clearly share in the Stars recovery
168,"Good morning, Christine"
169,"So again, it is the case that without commenting on our competitors, that the tax deductibility of the HIF, we did not reflect in benefits for 2017."
170,"And so, therefore, with the HIF coming back in 2018, we don't have to reduce benefits to effectively offset that or take an impact to margin, depending on what you want to do"
171,That amount is something we don't have to address
172,"And by the way, it was the reason why we did in the first place because we were concerned that we'd be in the situation"
173,"and we want to try to be keep benefit stable,"
174,which we've been successful doing
175,"With respect to margin, as I mentioned with a previous question, we are above our margin target"
176,"We don't expect, by definition, to bid above our margin target, so there should be an expectation that our margin target will be lower next year"
177,"And we're not prepared to give guidance around that, as we've talked about"
178,"As it relates to group MA, we continue to be selective in picking our spots"
179,Our team is out there really pounding the pavement for opportunities
180,We feel pretty good about where we stand in the group MA business and looking at a number of prospects
181,"But I would tell you that, as we said in multiple calls, we're going to be disciplined as we price that product"
182,"It's got to make sense from a return on capital perspective and from a risk perspective before we're willing to sign up, particularly for some of these large jumbo accounts"
183,Yeah
184,I'm really not prepared to comment on group MA growth at this point
185,"Again, there's a number of prospects we're looking at and the guys are doing a really good job, but I think it's just early to comment on group MA growth at this point"
