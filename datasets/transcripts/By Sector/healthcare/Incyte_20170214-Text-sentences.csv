1,"I'd like to start by discussing our fourth quarter and 2016 performance and then provide guidance for 2017, which will include the accounting for Agenus, Merus and Calithera agreements"
2,"In the fourth quarter, we recorded $326 million in total revenue"
3,"This was comprised of $238 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $13 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $33 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis and $43 million in contract revenue, including a milestone paid to us by Novartis, related to pricing approval of Jakavi for PV"
4,"For 2016, we recorded $1.1 billion of total revenue"
5,"This was comprised of $853 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $30 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $111 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis and $113 million in contract revenue"
6,Our gross to net adjustment for Jakafi for 2016 was approximately 12%
7,"Our cost of product revenue for the quarter and full year was $20 million and $58 million, respectively"
8,"This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis for U.S"
9,Jakafi net sales and the amortization of acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition
10,"Our R&D expense for the quarter was $162 million, including $17 million in non-cash stock compensation"
11,"For the full year, our R&D expense was $582 million, including $60 million in non-cash stock compensation"
12,"Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $96 million, including $10 million in non-cash stock compensation"
13,"For the full year, our SG&A expense was $303 million, including $36 million in non-cash stock compensation"
14,We recorded $7 million in expense related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability in the fourth quarter and $17 million for the full year
15,"As for net income for the quarter and full year, we reported $9 million and $104 million, respectively"
16,"Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $809 million in cash and marketable securities"
17,"To summarize, we are extremely pleased with our performance in 2016."
18,Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth
19,We grew our cash position by over $100 million for the year and continue to make significant advancements in our clinical development programs
20,"Turning to slide 21, I would like to highlight some key drivers of our 2017 guidance"
21,We anticipate that milestone payments may add significantly to Incyte's total revenue during 2017.
22,The events which may trigger these milestones are laid out on the left hand side of slide 21.
23,"We announced that yesterday of the European approval of baricitinib, which will be marketed as Olumiant is the first of what we expect will be several global approvals of baricitinib"
24,"In addition, Lilly moving baricitinib into Phase 3 in new indications would also trigger milestone payments to Incyte"
25,We also anticipate that development and commercialization milestones on Jakavi may be triggered by Novartis
26,"On the expense side, we anticipate epacadostat and baricitinib to be drivers of ongoing R&D expense, and the recently signed agreements with Agenus, Merus and Calithera will add one-time items to our R&D expense in 2017."
27,"In terms of SG&A expense, 2017 will be the first full year that we include our European operations"
28,"Moving on, I'll now summarize the key components of our 2017 guidance"
29,"Please note, that the guidance we provide today does not include any additional potential future strategic transactions beyond the Merus and Calithera collaborations already announced"
30,"For 2017, we expect net product revenue from Jakafi to be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion"
31,"For Iclusig, we expect net product revenue to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million"
32,"And as I detailed on the previous slide, we expect to receive up to $300 million in milestone payments from our collaboration partners"
33,The most significant portion of the $300 million milestone payments will be $165 million in milestone payments from Lilly for baricitinib approvals in the U.S
34,"We anticipate receiving royalties from Lilly after the approval of Olumiant, and will continue to receive royalty payments from Novartis on Jakavi in 2017."
35,We are not providing guidance on these royalties
36,We expect our gross to net adjustment for 2017 to be approximately 13% for Jakafi
37,"Jakafi is the main driver of our gross to net adjustment and as with similar oncology drugs, our gross to net adjustment is higher in the first quarter than the rest of the year, primarily because of our share of a donut hole from Medicare Part D patients"
38,We expect total cost of goods sold to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million
39,"This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S"
40,"Jakafi net sales and the amortization of acquired product rights, related to the Iclusig product acquisition"
41,"2017 R&D expense guidance is made up of two parts; one-time expenses associated with Agenus, Merus and Calithera collaborations, and ongoing expense associated with development of our extensive product pipeline"
42,The Merus collaboration consisted of $120 million upfront cash payment and an $80 million stock investment
43,We will recognize the $120 million payment along with approximately a $2 million premium on the stock purchase as R&D expense in the first quarter
44,The Calithera collaboration agreement consisted of a $45 million upfront cash payment and an $8 million stock investment
45,We will recognize the $45 million payment along with an approximate $4 million discount on the stock purchase as R&D expense in the first quarter
46,This will result in $41 million of R&D expense in the first quarter for this particular collaboration
47,The amendment on the Agenus agreement consists of $20 million in accelerated milestone payments and a $60 million (21:21) stock investment
48,We'll recognize the $20 million payment along with approximately $20 million premium on the stock purchase as R&D expense in the first quarter
49,We therefore expect these one-time expense items to be approximately $205 million
50,"and we expect ongoing R&D expense to be in the range of $785 million to $835 million, including non-cash expense related to employee equity awards"
51,"The increase in our ongoing R&D expense year-over-year is mainly driven by the advancement of our products in the pipeline, including the previously announced plans to move into multiple Phase 3 studies of epacadostat and an opt-in to co-fund additional indications for baricitinib with Lilly"
52,"We expect SG&A expense to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million, including non-cash expense related to employee equity awards"
53,"As I mentioned earlier, the increase in our SG&A expense year-over-year includes a full year of expense for our recently acquired European operations versus seven months in 2016."
54,We expect total non-cash expense related to employee equity awards to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million
55,"In addition, we expect a change in the fair market value of a contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million"
56,"And finally, we expect net income to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million"
57,I would note however that the inherent uncertainty with respect to achievement and timing of milestones I detailed earlier may create variability in our net income on a quarterly basis
58,"I'll finish on slide 23, which provides a summary of our clinical and strategic goals"
59,"Incyte is very well-positioned from a cash and operating income perspective to execute on our strategies for growth, which we are confident will deliver significant long-term shareholder value in 2017 and beyond"
60,"Incyte has a broad portfolio of late-stage assets, which have the potential to drive significant momentum and value over the next several years"
61,We also have plans for further geographic expansion into the Asia Pacific region to enable us to maximize the potential of our product portfolio
62,"Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks"
63,Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A
64,Question-and-Answer Session
65,"Salveen, it's Dave"
66,I'll take your second question on the SG&A expense
67,The reason it's slightly higher in Q4 is just the artifact of timing between Q3 and Q4.
68,"So that was just a timing issue and on a go-forward basis, if you look into 2017, we wouldn't expect to see that kind of a difference between Q3 and Q4."
69,I'll try to attempt to answer the question on the milestones
70,"We announced today that obviously with the approval of baricitinib in Europe, we will get a $65 million milestone that will come through in Q1."
71,And Lilly has stated on the U.S
72,"approval, one should look to that in terms of the Q2 timeframe"
73,"So, it's safe to say that there will be at least a goodly amount of milestones in Q2, but"
74,"Q1 there is just one so far, as a result of that"
75,"plus it would be additional programs we talked about collaborations between Agenus, Merus and Calithera"
76,"there will be a loss in Q1, because there won't be enough milestones to offset those one-time R&D costs"
77,"And after that in Q2, there'll be another substantial milestone"
78,and then some smaller ones that carry in Q3 and Q4.
