8,"The first quarter Jakafi royalties of $29 million represents 32% growth over the same period last year, but is slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, because the royalty tiers reset each calendar year, and we are in the lower tier in the first part of each year"

10,Based on the recent news of the baricitinib complete response letter in the U.S
11,", we have decided to take a very conservative approach around milestone guidance for the remainder of 2017, and we are removing remaining baricitinib approval and development milestones from our 2017 financial guidance"
12,"Our revised milestone guidance is now up to $130 million for the full year 2017, of which we have already recognized $90 million in the first quarter"
