Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone
The second quarter was very strong
We recorded $326 million of total revenue
This was comprised of $276 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $16 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $34 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis, and $1 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly
Jakafi's net product revenue of $276 million represents 33% growth over the same period last year
Based on Jakafi's performance for the first six months of the year, we are increasing our full year Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $1.090 billion to $1.120 billion
Our gross-to-net adjustment for the second quarter was approximately 12%
We expect the total gross-to-net adjustment for the full year to be approximately 13%
Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $20 million
This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S
Jakafi net sales, and the amortization of acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition in Europe
Our R&D expense for the quarter was $202 million, including $23 million in non-cash stock compensation
For the full year, we expect R&D expense to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.150 billion
This is an increase from the previous guidance last quarter
The increased R&D expense guidance is related to the acceleration of the Phase 3 plans for epacadostat
Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $90 million, including $11 million in non-cash stock compensation
We recorded $7 million in expense related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability
Moving on to non-operating expenses, we recorded $20 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments in Merus and Agenus, and a one-time debt exchange expense of $1 million related to senior note conversions of $20 million during the quarter
For the second quarter, we recorded a loss of $12 million, primarily due to the previously mentioned $20 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $609 million in cash and marketable securities, and expect to end the year with over $600 million
On our final slide, you'll see our full year guidance
In addition to the updates I've already mentioned, a $15 million milestone will be recognized in the third quarter for the Japanese approval of Olumiant
As a result, we now expect up to $145 million in milestones for the year
Incorporating all these previously discussed changes, including the $20 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments, we now expect a net loss between $180 million to $200 million for the year
To summarize, our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our underlying business, as well as to continue advancement of our clinical development programs
We continue to execute on our development plans for a robust pipeline and look forward to updating you on our progress during our third quarter call
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks
