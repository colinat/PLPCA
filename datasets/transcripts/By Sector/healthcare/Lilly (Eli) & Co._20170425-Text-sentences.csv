0,Thank you for joining Eli Lilly & Company's First Quarter 2017
1,Earnings Call
2,"I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's President and CEO"
3,"Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr"
4,"Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA"
5,"Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and I'd like to extend a special welcome to Christi Shaw, who joined us earlier this month as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines"
6,"We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of the IR team"
7,"During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations"
8,"Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide three and as outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC"
9,The information we provide about our products and pipelines is for the benefit of the investment community; it is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions
10,"Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start with a summary of our progress on our strategic objectives since our earnings call in January"
11,Starting with grow revenue
12,"Q1, we generated worldwide revenue growth of 7%, which was driven by 9% volume growth in our pharmaceutical business, led by our new products"
13,"On our strategic objective of expand margins, our non-GAAP gross margin percent, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, increased by nearly 220 basis points compared to Q1 2016."
14,And total operating expenses as a percent of revenue also declined by nearly 220 basis points
15,"Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, we launched baricitinib under the trade name Olumiant in Europe for rheumatoid arthritis"
16,While here in the U.S
17,", we were disappointed to receive the complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib in RA"
18,"We remain confident the benefit-risk of baricitinib as a new treatment option for adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we will work with the FDA to determine a path forward to ultimately bring baricitinib to patients in the U.S"
19,"And as I'll discuss in more detail later, we had a positive Phase 3 read-out for abemaciclib, for Taltz and for Cyramza"
20,"Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we completed the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, which adds lasmiditan for acute migraine to our late-stage pipeline"
21,And we returned over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend
22,Our continued progress in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our mid-term goals for each of our strategic objectives
23,Now let's go to slide five for a more detailed review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call
24,"On the commercial front, here in the U.S"
25,"in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim we launched Synjardy XR, a once-daily combination tablet containing empagliflozin and extended-release metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes"
26,"As I mentioned earlier, we launched Olumiant in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, following European Commission approval earlier this year"
27,"On the regulatory front, U.S"
28,FDA issued a complete response letter for baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis
29,The letter indicated that the FDA was unable to approve the application in its current form
30,"Specifically, the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses and to further characterize safety concerns"
31,"Lilly and Incyte disagree with the Agency's conclusion, and we look forward to meeting with the FDA in the coming months to determine appropriate next steps"
32,We'll provide you status updates after we meet with the FDA
33,", the FDA approved an update to the Trulicity label to include use in combination with basal insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes"
34,"And in Europe, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received European Commission approval of an update to the Synjardy label to include a change to the indication statement as well as data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial on the reduction of cardiovascular death"
35,"On the clinical front, we announced that MONARCH 2 is a Phase 3 trial of abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in women with HR+ and HER2- breast cancer met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival"
36,We look forward to presenting data from this study at ASCO in early June
37,"And we'll hold a call the evening of Saturday, June 3 to discuss these results with the investment community"
38,"Finally, we've decided to move the FDA submission of MONARCH 2 from the previously announced timing of Q3 up in to Q2."
39,"And just yesterday we announced that the MONARCH 3 study with abemaciclib met its primary endpoint at an interim analysis, demonstrating that women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy experienced a statistically significant improvement in PFS with treatment with abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor"
40,The improvement was also shown in a key secondary endpoint of objective response rate
41,We intend to begin global regulatory submissions of these results in Q3 2017.
42,"For the RAINFALL study of ramucirumab in first-line gastric cancer, the independent data monitoring committee recently met to review the primary analysis"
43,"While we remain blinded to the data, we're pleased to report that the IBMC stated that the study met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival"
44,"Consistent with our prior communications, our expectation remains that regulatory submissions could occur after we have the final overall survival data in 2018."
45,"At the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting, we presented Phase 3 data showing that patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with ixekizumab, or Taltz, demonstrated superior efficacy at 24 weeks compared to patients treated with Stelara"
46,"And along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we initiated two Phase 3 studies of Jardiance for the treatment of chronic heart failure"
47,These trials will enroll patients with and without diabetes and with both preserved as well as reduced ejection fraction heart failure
48,Moving to slide six
49,"As I mentioned earlier in business development news, we completed the addition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals"
50,"In other news, in Japan, the IP High Court ruled in our favor in the invalidation trials initiated by Sawai regarding our vitamin regimen patents for Alimta"
51,"If the patents are ultimately upheld through all the challenges, they could provide intellectual property protection for Alimta in Japan until June of 2021."
52,"To support the increased demand for our products in our pipeline, we announced plans to invest $850 million in our U.S"
53,"operations in 2017, including research laboratories, manufacturing facilities and some administrative areas"
54,We also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend
55,Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter
56,"Thanks, John"
57,"Well, I think we've addressed this question before, but just to reiterate"
58,"Basaglar is a great fit for us because we already have an asset base to make the product, we have a commercial investment that can sell the product"
59,and we have devices that are world-class that the product goes in
60,"So it's really a drop-in to a broader insulin play and rounds out an important part of the portfolio we weren't participating in, which is the innovative basal segment, which is obviously a big segment of the diabetes market"
61,But our core strategy in diabetes is to innovate above and beyond the benefits of glargine in basal insulin as it is all other therapies
62,"And that's really the same as our other therapy areas, oncology, immunology"
63,Our main focus is on innovation to beat the standard of care today for something better for patients
64,"If those same dynamics played out for a TNF biosimilar or something else, sure, we'd look at it"
65,"When you can get a lot of leverage financially and it tucks into your portfolio, that can make good sense"
66,But we don't have a broad-based division associated with biosimilars work
67,We're not pursuing that at this moment
68,Sure
69,Thanks
70,"I think, Jami, your question is, if I heard it right, is would we undertake some very large cost restructuring programs and sort of make a one-time move in operating margins"
71,"Right now, under the scenario we see and per the discussion we also had with Derica today, we see a continuous top-line revenue growth driven by new products"
72,"And the kind of performance we put up in Q1, if we just compound that out I think will yield impressive margin gains"
73,"Reminding people 7% top line, 3% cost curve, yielding 18% income growth"
74,"I think if we compound that over the next several years, you'll be (51:50) top-tier financial performance out of Lilly"
75,Ad that's where we're focused on rather than try to have some disruptive event that would perhaps set us back in terms of revenue growth and our R&D productivity
76,So right now that's what we're focused on
77,"Of course, we have scenarios, as Derica described, that have different mixes of products that get us to that 5% average top line, some that get us well above it"
78,We're very comfortable with that guidance now
79,Yeah
80,It's primarily based on a topline growth
81,", that's right"
82,"If you do the math, there are targeted cost reductions, which have been and we'll continue to undertake, to reshape the company and make it as competitive as it needs to be as well as service the R&D engine as well us"
83,the launches that are underway
84,"Well, our posture on M&A really hasn't changed"
85,It's a top priority for deployment of capital
86,"Of course, we are very interested in targets that would enhance our position, whether it be pipeline or otherwise, in oncology, in diabetes, in immunology or in Alzheimer's or pain"
87,"When we've seen those things, we've moved quickly"
88,I think CoLucid is an example of that
89,"The reality in the world, though, is, I think, that there are constraints"
90,And one of them is pricing
91,We're not the only company looking for these assets
92,The other is strategic fit
93,We're going to be disciplined to stick to therapeutic areas where we have an ongoing interest
94,We think this is where we have information advantage and we want to trade on that
95,"And then I think the asset fit within our pipeline, when we're talking about pipeline assets, we seek to acquire things that can be producing interesting combinations or fill gaps"
96,So we're very focused on this space
97,"Obviously, we had one transaction in Q1."
98,I hope we can find more like it because we see a lot of value in CoLucid as an example
99,It's a top priority for me and we continue to scour the planet for good opportunities to add to Lilly's growth story
100,"And just as a reminder, the R&D study just had the four milligram in it against Humira"
101,"So I think if that's your question, just remind the group that that was the only dose studied in that particular (1:10:10) analysis"
102,"Yeah, and just briefly on baricitinib"
103,You're correct in saying that the program had a number of step ups after the initial placebo-controlled phases
104,So many patients moved from two to four milligrams or placebo to four (1:21:50) standard in RA studies
105,"And we also in the long-term study everyone rolled into, we had a step-down feature"
106,"So we have a lot of data about two versus four, and we look forward to talking to the FDA more about that data in the coming weeks and days"
107,We participate your participation in today's earnings call and interest in the Eli Lilly & Company
108,"As we've discussed before, Lilly is entering a period of growth driven by new product launches"
109,"The diversity in our portfolio, our top-line growth prospect and the opportunity for margin expansions over the balance of the decade provide a compelling thesis for investors"
110,I look forward to our continued interactions and keep you informed of our progress
111,Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we didn't address today
