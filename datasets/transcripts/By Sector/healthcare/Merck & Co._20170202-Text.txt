Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone
This morning I'll provide highlights of Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016. My comments will be on a constant currency basis
Global Human Health annual sales reached $35.2 billion and grew 2%
All core areas: oncology, vaccines, diabetes, and hospital and specialty care, contributed to the growth
In the fourth quarter, sales of $8.9 billion declined 1%
We were able to mostly offset the impact from LOEs in the quarter from growth products, from new products including KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, but also from inline products such as JANUVIA and our vaccine franchise
I'll now highlight a few of our product launches in key franchises, and I'll start with oncology
We continued to execute well on the launch of KEYTRUDA globally, and we are confident about the opportunity we see for this important brand
In the fourth quarter, sales were $482 million, driving strong full-year sales of $1.4 billion
, KEYTRUDA fourth quarter sales of $311 million were driven by continued strength in melanoma, rapid penetration of head and neck cancer, and the launch of first-line lung
Since our first-line lung approval in late October, we have seen a significant acceleration in PD-L1 testing in non-small-cell lung cancer
Our early data suggests that about two-thirds of new patients are being tested
And the vast majority of first-line patients that are tested and also have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50% are being treated with KEYTRUDA
Outside of the U.S
, melanoma continued to be the primary driver of sales of $172 million in the quarter
In addition to the nearly 60 markets in which we have melanoma approvals, launches are underway in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer in more than 50 markets
We're working through the reimbursement process for each country, and we expect a meaningful contribution in 2017 from second-line lung as many of these countries come online
We'll also begin reimbursement discussions on first-line lung as we gain additional approvals outside of the U.S
Of note, we're looking forward to launching in Japan, where we've recently been approved for first-line and second-line lung as well as melanoma
This is only the beginning of opportunity that we see for KEYTRUDA in 2017 and beyond
Similar to melanoma and head and neck cancer, we are committed to building a leadership position in lung
We're moving forward with additional investment to leverage our unimpeded position in first-line lung
And as you may have seen, we've recently initiated a consumer campaign in the United States
We're also looking forward to further broadening the opportunity for KEYTRUDA, with three PDUFA dates upcoming in just the first half of 2017, and we expect even more to come
Now I'll move to primary care
The JANUVIA franchise grew 4% globally in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S
, where sales grew 12% due to increased volume and some customer buy-in
TRx trends remained strong in the U.S
with growth of over 3% in the fourth quarter
We've now seen more than 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth in the U.S
Outside of the U.S
, sales declined slightly due to the unfavorable impact of customer shipment timing in Japan
For the full year, the franchise generated sales of $6.1 billion or 2% growth
We remain encouraged by the underlying volume trends in the U.S
and around the world for JANUVIA, and we continue to see opportunities to grow our diabetes franchise
We have maintained very good managed care coverage in 2017, though this access comes with higher discounts and rebates, as we said before
Despite this increased pricing pressure, we remain confident in the franchise
Our vaccine business grew 2% in the fourth quarter to $1.7 billion, with the increase primarily driven by PNEUMOVAX and GARDASIL
Full-year sales also grew, increasing 10% to $6.2 billion, with GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines, and PNEUMOVAX all delivering double-digit growth
GARDASIL sales in the fourth quarter grew 9% to $542 million on another strong quarter in the U.S
Sales for the full year increased 14%, as we continued to transition sales to GARDASIL 9 around the world
We expect a rapid transition to the two-dose regimen in 2017, and that will have a negative impact on sales in the U.S
But we are confident in GARDASIL 9 over the long term
In addition, we completed the termination of our vaccine joint venture in Europe in with Sanofi in the fourth quarter, and we have fully integrated our vaccine operations as of January 1. Moving now to hospital and specialty care, sales grew 2% to $8.1 billion for the full year
Fourth quarter sales of $1.9 billion declined 3%, as the decline in REMICADE continued to accelerate and CUBICIN sales were subject to generic competition in the U.S
These declines were partially offset by contributions from launched products, including BRIDION and ZEPATIER
BRIDION had another strong quarter with nearly 50% growth, driven by strong uptake from the launch in the U.S
as well as continued demand in Europe, the emerging markets, and Japan
Surgical trends support the increased use of BRIDION, and we are excited about the opportunity we see for BRIDION in 2017 and beyond
We also continue to be encouraged by the progress made with ZEPATIER in its first year of launch
Sales were $229 million in the quarter
, we've continued to gain market share, and we remain focused on driving greater utilization across the public and private plans in which we've gained access
Some of these formulary wins had effective dates of January 1, and they are expected to meaningfully contribute to our results in 2017. Outside of the U.S
, we are encouraged by the initial uptake following recent launches in Japan and the EU late in the fourth quarter
We're pleased with the reimbursement discussions that are still ongoing across Europe as well as the expansion of reimbursement criteria in several large markets
All together, Global Human Health delivered solid results in 2016. While we'll have to contend to the significant impact in 2017 of revenue from the loss of U.S
exclusivity for several large brands, including ZETIA, VYTORIN, CUBICIN, and NASONEX, we will continue to execute on the opportunities we have in front of us
We are committed to building our leadership position for KEYTRUDA around the world, and we'll continue to prioritize resources behind key franchises like JANUVIA and vaccines
And we will maximize other product launches such as ZEPATIER and BRIDION
This together will position us well for years ahead
With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger
Hi, Jeff
So with regard to KEYNOTE-021G, as you know, right now KEYTRUDA is approved first-line use in patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%
Assuming that KEYNOTE-021G gets put into the label, we anticipate that that would open up the non-squamous lung market
So we would have patients that are negative on PD-L1 all the way from PD-L1 of 1% up through greater than 50%
So it certainly would open up the rest of the market
The way I would think about it, though, is that from what we can tell, physicians will be much more apt to use the combination in patients that they deem to be relatively healthy
They're going to evaluate it patient by patient and see where they believe that the combination of the two would outweigh potential side effects and so forth
So I think initially, it will be used in patients that are relatively healthy and those where they would be thinking about using ALIMTA anyway
After that, we believe that it will go into patients that are relatively healthy where they're not necessarily thinking about ALIMTA but they might start to use ALIMTA in combination with KEYTRUDA to treat those patients and get better results
And then lastly, over time, we think that even in patients that are less healthy, they'll probably, after having a lot of exposure to the combination, begin to use it in those patients as well
Hi, Jami
So, first of all, when you think about KEYNOTE-021G, it certainly opens up the entire market for first-line for non-squamous patients
And once it's in the label, I think physicians will tend to use the product
Our representatives will be able to promote it appropriately
They'll be able to talk about the data and the information
And typically, the physicians will follow the label on something as important as first-line lung cancer, where people don't have great alternatives
I think that we will be able to see physicians begin to use it as soon as we have the data in the label
With regard to progression-free survival versus overall survival, remember, we launched melanoma with progression-free survival, and we were able to get very rapid uptake there
And I think physicians understand that having that in your label is going to make a difference
So I do believe that it will give us a lead in first-line lung for sure, once the data are available
And obviously, once the second study is out there, then I think it's even going to help us further into the future
As I start to think about I-O/I-O combinations, I'm glad that we're doing those trials, because we don't have all the information that we need to figure out exactly where the future is going to take us
But the good news is, we're off to a great start
Hopefully, we'll get KEYNOTE-021G in the label, which will give us even a further head start in first-line lung
Physicians will become very comfortable using KEYTRUDA as the drug of choice in first-line lung where it's approved
And then over time, I think we'll have a very solid position in the trials that Roger and his team are looking at across I-O/I-O combinations will only be helpful as we learn more
