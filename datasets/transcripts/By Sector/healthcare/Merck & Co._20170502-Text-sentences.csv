0,"Good morning, everyone"
1,"This morning I'll provide highlights in Global Human Health performance for the first quarter of 2017, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis"
2,We are off to a solid start for the year
3,"Global Human Health sales of $8.2 billion increased 2%, with growth from launched products including KEYTRUDA, BRIDION, and ZEPATIER, as well as our broad portfolio of vaccines, which more than offset the impact of LOEs in the U.S"
4,We had a strong quarter outside the U.S
5,", with growth of 7%"
6,"I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology"
7,We continue to execute on the significant opportunity we see with KEYTRUDA and our global leadership position in immuno-oncology
8,"Global sales in the first quarter were $584 million, which represents significant growth versus the first quarter of last year, including U.S"
9,growth of approximately 170%
10,"In the United States, KEYTRUDA growth was driven by the launch in first-line lung, as well as the rapid penetration of head and neck cancer and continued strength in melanoma"
11,"After seeing a significant increase in PD-L1 testing following our first-line lung approval in the fourth quarter, we are starting to see that translate into demand"
12,"In fact, the vast majority of patients as defined by our label are already being prescribed KEYTRUDA"
13,"Based on IMS brand impact new patient data, KEYTRUDA is now the most prescribed product in the first-line-lung setting"
14,"In addition, our second-line-lung share has been relatively stable, and we're working to grow that share with our expanded indication into all PD-L1 positive patients"
15,"Outside of the United States, melanoma continues to drive the majority of KEYTRUDA sales with approvals in almost 60 countries"
16,"We're now working through the reimbursement process for both first-line and second-line lung, so anticipate lung will become a much larger contributor outside of the U.S"
17,as we progress through the year
18,Now I'll move to primary care
19,Global sales for JANUVIA franchise reached $1.3 billion and experienced a decline of 5% in the quarter driven by the U.S
20,We continue to see good TRx growth of approximately 3% in the U.S
21,"; however, as we mentioned previously, the timing of customer buying makes a difficult comparison versus last year"
22,JANUVIA continues to maintain DPP-4 leadership with more than a 70% market share in the U.S
23,and 65% market share globally
24,We remain confident in the diabetes franchise and look forward to expanding the franchise with our SGLT2 and SGLT2 combination with JANUVIA which we filed in the first quarter of this year
25,"Moving to vaccines, sales reached $1.5 billion and grew 21%, primarily driven by increases in GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX"
26,"The addition of approximately $65 million of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi, most of which was GARDASIL, also contributed to growth"
27,"Global GARDASIL sales grew 41% this quarter, also on strength in the U.S"
28,and emerging markets
29,", GARDASIL sales growth of 25% reflects increased demand as well as timing of CDC purchases of approximately $45 million"
30,We've continued to monitor the negative impact of the transition to a two-dose regimen in the U.S
31,PNEUMOVAX sales increased 52% in the quarter
32,Growth was driven by another strong quarter in the U.S
33,", where we continue to benefit from adoption of the ACIP recommendation for patients 65 and older"
34,Moving now to hospital and specialty care
35,We continue to execute well on the launches of both ZEPATIER and BRIDION
36,ZEPATIER generated $378 million in sales for the quarter
37,"We have seen rapid uptake in Europe and Japan since ZEPATIER's launch in late 2016, while we remain encouraged by initial feedback from physicians, payers and scientific leaders"
38,In the U.S
39,", we continue to drive share gains for ZEPATIER across public and private payer segments"
40,Sales in the quarter also reflect an approximately $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals
41,BRIDION delivered another strong quarter with growth of more than 60%
42,We continue to see strong uptake from the launch in the U.S
43,", as well as growth in underlying demand in Europe and the emerging markets"
44,"As of this quarter, the U.S"
45,represents the largest market for BRIDION sales
46,"In conclusion, this quarter we had to contend with a nearly $700 million decline in sales due to LOEs"
47,"We anticipate further erosion from these products in 2017, but as we did in the first quarter, we will continue to look for opportunities to offset these losses with strength from across our broad portfolio of products and from our multiple new-product launches, which are each off to a very strong start"
48,Now I'll turn the call over to Roger
49,"Hi, Geoff"
50,This is Adam
51,So let me start by saying we're pleased with the progress that we have with KEYTRUDA across indications including lung
52,"And if you look at what we've done with our proved indication, the vast majority of patients within our indication are already being prescribed KEYTRUDA for first-line lung, and KEYTRUDA's now the most prescribed drug for first-line lung in the marketplace"
53,"As we start to think about KEYNOTE-021G, first of all, it obviously expands the market opportunity in nonsquamous patients and it also includes patients with low or no PD-L1 expression, so basically, it opens up the rest of the market"
54,"But with that said, there's a couple other things to consider"
55,"First of all, we believe that physicians will look at individual patients and decide whether or not combination therapy is right to start those patients"
56,"So if you have a younger patient that's relatively healthy, they might think about treating that patient with combo differently than if they have an older patient that's more complicated"
57,"In addition to that, we believe that, since we've studied the drug with ALIMTA, that early adoption will probably be used where physicians would use ALIMTA"
58,"Over time that'll expand, we believe, to other chemotherapies as the physicians start to see the results with the combination that we studied"
59,"So, in summary, we believe it's a very significant opportunity"
60,It's not a pent-up demand
61,I would look at it as a build as new patients come into the market
62,"and I think that it really is exciting opportunity for lung cancer patients, but also to establish KEYTRUDA further as a real preferred treatment therapy"
63,"Yeah, so this is Adam"
64,"First of all, we're pleased with the progress of KEYTRUDA and the $584 million in sales"
65,If you look at the U.S
66,which is the first market where we're really launching lung because we're still working on reimbursement outside the U.S
67,", and we saw a 170% increase versus the same quarter prior-year"
68,"And if you look at quarter-over-quarter growth and you adjust it for the $40 million that we told you about last quarter, you had over 30% quarter-over-quarter growth in the United States"
69,"And if you look at the data from simply (33:18) other areas, you would've gotten to about the number that we achieved"
70,"In addition to that, to provide additional context, if you look at the sales in the United States, right now about 40% of it is coming from lung"
71,So you've seen a very significant increase in the amount of sales coming from the lung indication and in fact the first quarter of this year is the first quarter in which lung is the largest percent of our total sales
72,So we remain optimistic about the progress with KEYTRUDA
73,We think that there are opportunities to continue to grow with all the indications that we have and we'll look forward to seeing what happens with 021G
74,"And, Jami, if you look at the share, it's about 25% in non-small lung cancer"
75,"And as I said in my remarks, I think that it'll start off with physicians using it within whatever the indication is"
76,"So if it's with ALIMTA, they'll use it with ALIMTA"
77,We'll obviously continue to promote based upon the label that we have
78,"I do believe that over time, physicians will begin to use it with other chemotherapy, irrespective of label"
79,"But again, that's nothing that we would promote"
80,"And then if you look at GARDASIL, we had $530 million of sales"
81,"The two things I'd point out is one, there's about $45 million of CDC purchases in the quarter, that was due to timing; the second thing is, there's about $50 million of sales from Europe because we dissolved the joint venture with Sanofi"
82,"Outside of those two things, I would say demand remains strong, and we continue to see increased penetration rates, not just in males, but even in females as well"
83,"And right now, Tony, our market share is greater than 90% globally, almost 100% in the United States"
84,So we remain optimistic about demand
85,"To me, the key thing is, is what happens with the two-dose regimen"
86,"So we're seeing increased demand right now, a lot of people getting their first doses"
87,"The question will be, do they come back for their second dose in six months?"
88,"Or will it be next year, a year later?"
89,And we still have to wait to see how the two doses plays out
90,Yep
91,"So for HCV, we continue to see good progress with ZEPATIER"
92,"and we saw it, not just in the U.S"
93,", but we've seen good progress in Europe, but also in Japan"
94,"As you look at the HCV market, there's no doubt that it's a large market"
95,"and it's a large opportunity, but it's going to play out over many years"
96,"And as we look at the market, we see a reduction in number of patients being treated this year versus last year, and we think that that's going to continue to be difficult, as it's harder to get new patients into the market"
97,Many of the tough-to-treat patients or those that were already previously diagnosed have been treated
98,"Although there's still a lot of patients, we have to work harder to get those patients into the buying process"
99,"That's particularly true in the United States, but it's also true in country like Japan, where there's less patients each and every year, and there's not a lot of new patients coming into the Japanese market"
100,"So with that, we believe that it's still a significant opportunity"
101,"As we look at increased competition, we'll have to see what final labels look like, and we'll have to see pricing strategies and those types of things, but my expectation is that this continues to be a large market, albeit a declining market"
102,Let me give you some additional context on KEYTRUDA
103,"So first of all, we're seeing pretty broad adoption"
104,"As I mentioned, the vast majority of patients within our approved indication for lung cancer are being treated"
105,So that tells you it has to be both an academic but also outside of academic centers
106,"So for our first line share to be what it is, you would have to see pretty broad utilization"
107,"And if you look now, melanoma is 30% of our total sales but head and neck is also 15% of our sales"
108,"So we're seeing increased utilization in head and neck as well, which we're seeing fairly broad-based for physicians that treat that type of cancer"
109,"In addition to that, as you look at what we're seeing, physicians are using the products primarily based upon the indications we have"
110,"In terms of looking at the dosing regimens, I do think we may have an advantage there with our dosing regimen and scheduling versus competition"
111,But it really is about efficacy
112,It's about what indications that you have
113,and it's about ensuring the appropriate utilization based on your indications
114,And I think that's what's allowing us to win in the marketplace as we sit here today
115,"Yeah,"
116,"so Alex, as you look at the utilization of KEYTRUDA in the U.S, and this is, again, a rough estimate with the data that we have, about 40% is lung, 30% melanoma, 15% head and neck"
117,and then 15% is all other utilization of the product
118,"And if you look at PD-L1 testing, the vast majority of patients are being tested somewhere between 75% to 80% in the United States"
119,"If you look at our share in first-line lung, our share is about â€"
120,"“ if you look at early data, one in four patients or so are being treated for first-line setting"
121,"And then if you look at second-line lung patients, we have a share of about 15% which has been pretty stable over time"
122,"Outside the U.S, PD-L1 testing is increasing significantly"
123,"In Japan, it's remarkable how fast they've begun to adopt PD-L1 testing and frankly, even in Europe, about two thirds of physicians are already testing PD-L1 including about 80% in Germany and 60% or so in the U.K"
124,"So we're seeing PD-L1 testing pick up around the world, frankly"
