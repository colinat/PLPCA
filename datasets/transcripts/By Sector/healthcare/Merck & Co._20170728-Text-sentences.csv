0,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone"
1,This morning I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter
2,And my comments will be on a constant currency basis
3,Global Human Health delivered another solid quarter
4,"Worldwide sales of $8.8 billion grew 2% with contributions from launched products including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION as well as our vaccine portfolio more than offsetting the continued impact from LOEs"
5,We also had another strong quarter outside of the U.S
6,with growth of 8%
7,"I'll highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, starting with KEYTRUDA"
8,"We continue to build our leadership position in immuno-oncology, as we execute on the great opportunity we have with the launch of KEYTRUDA"
9,In the second quarter we added to our momentum with four new indications in the U.S
10,and an additional indication in Europe
11,"Sales grew to just over $880 million, a very significant increase over prior year"
12,"In the United States, KEYTRUDA sales continued to build across multiple indications with lung cancer now contributing to roughly half of the sales"
13,Sales in the fourth quarter â€“ or sales in the second quarter also reflect favorability of approximately $40 million due to the timing of customer purchases
14,"In first-line lung cancer, KEYTRUDA is the only approved anti-PD-1 therapy"
15,And we've seen a strong adoption of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressive populations
16,And KEYTRUDA has quickly become standard of care in that setting
17,"While still early days for the KEYTRUDA/ALIMTA combination, feedback from oncologists has been positive following the FDA approval in mid-May"
18,"In fact, the combination was added to NCCN guidelines a couple of weeks ago as a recommended therapy in first-line non-squamous lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 status"
19,We've also start to see a greater contribution from lung cancer outside of the U.S
20,KEYTRUDA is now approved in the first- and second-line lung cancer settings in more than 60 countries
21,We continue to achieve reimbursement in more markets
22,And we're seeing a steady increase in patients being tested for PD-L1 status
23,"In addition to momentum in Europe, we've also seen strong uptake in both first-"
24,and second-line lung in Japan
25,That follows our launch in the first quarter
26,"Outside of lung cancer, KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma in the United States and in many markets around the world"
27,"We've also seen strong launches across bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma as well as early interest in MSA-high (sic) [MSI-high], the first tumor agnostic indication"
28,We are excited about the continued growth of KEYTRUDA across indications
29,We believe our breadth of approved and future indications across tumor types will continue to establish KEYTRUDA as a foundation for the treatment of cancer
30,"In addition, we are very much looking forward to collaborating with AstraZeneca in oncology as announced yesterday"
31,We believe LYNPARZA can be a very important product in different indications over time
32,"And the combination of our proven commercial success in oncology launching KEYTRUDA, with AstraZeneca's strong experience, will enable us together to make this product a tremendous success"
33,Moving now to JANUVIA
34,"Global sales for the JANUVIA franchise were $1.5 billion, a 7% decline, primarily driven by the U.S"
35,"In the second quarter, we saw solid volume growth of 3% in the U.S"
36,But we also saw continued pricing pressure as we've discussed before
37,There was also lower inventory levels being held in the channel
38,JANUVIA continues to maintain DPP-4 leadership and to be a preferred add-on after metformin
39,"We look forward to the opportunity to broaden our diabetes portfolio with the SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA, partnered with Pfizer"
40,That has a PDUFA date at the end of this year
41,Moving now to our Vaccine business
42,Sales of $1.4 billion grew 11% due to strength in GARDASIL and approximately $70 million of sales from the terminated joint venture with Sanofi
43,"In the United States, GARDASIL continues to see good underlying demand with very strong first dose coverage rates"
44,But we're starting to see some impact from the transition from a three-dose to a two-dose regimen
45,GARDASIL sales outside of the U.S
46,"grew this quarter, primarily driven by the JV termination"
47,Moving now to Hospital and Specialty
48,"Successful launches of ZEPATIER and BRIDION more than offset declines in CUBICIN, REMICADE, and ISENTRESS"
49,"ZEPATIER sales reached nearly $520 million, driven by strong underlying demand in the U.S"
50,", Europe, and Japan"
51,"We will continue to focus on expanding ZEPATIER's utilization globally, but recognize that uptake may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition"
52,"BRIDION had another good quarter with growth of more than 40%, driven by strong demand across ex-U.S"
53,markets and the continued success of the launch in the U.S
54,remains the largest opportunity for BRIDION moving forward
55,"In closing, we drove solid performance across many products this quarter, delivering growth despite a more than $800 million headwind from loss of exclusivity"
56,We continued to execute well on our product launches
57,And we look for additional opportunities across our broad portfolio to drive growth through the remainder of 2017.
58,With that I'll turn the call over to Roger
59,Good morning
60,"So if you look at JANUVIA, the IMS-2X (22:37) volume growth in the U.S"
61,It was about 3%
62,"However, it's not as strong growth as what we experienced last year, where it was about 4.5%"
63,"I've been saying for a couple years now that each year, the pricing pressure gets a little bit harder than the year before"
64,And this year is harder than last year
65,And I expect next year will be harder than this year
66,It's not discontinuous
67,"It's just continuous pressure that builds in the channel, particularly in the United States"
68,"As we look forward, we're excited about the SGLT2 and the SGLT2 combination with JANUVIA"
69,I believe that JANUVIA will continue to be the first choice for add-on therapy after metformin
70,And I think that will remain the case around the world
71,But a lot of patients still don't get to their HbA1c goals even with metformin plus JANUVIA
72,"So there are many patients where they look to add on an additional oral agent, of which the SGLT2 sometimes are the right product to add"
73,"Therefore, I believe having a combination with an SGLT2 with by far the market leader in the DPP-4 class will be a competitive advantage for us"
74,And that's why we look forward to launching that with a PDUFA date in the United States later this year
75,"So with regard to first-line lung cancer, a couple things are important"
76,"First of all, we are certainly seeing a strong uptake overall"
77,"And in the United States, KEYTRUDA is now the leader in terms of market share in first-line lung cancer"
78,"With regard to the combination with ALIMTA, we're certainly starting to see some uptake"
79,But it's still too early to give any specific market share for that portion of the business
80,"But as I mentioned on the call with NCCN recommendation and reimbursement, we think that will continue to be helpful"
81,So we are very pleased right now
82,About half of the sales for KEYTRUDA in the U.S
83,are in first-line lung
84,And that was the largest increase in terms of a percent of our sales
85,So we continue to believe that KEYTRUDA will be a mainstay for the treatment in lung cancer first-line
86,And this is Adam
87,So I feel very good about our position in first-line lung cancer today
88,"And if you look at the data that we have, not just as a monotherapy but also in combo with ALIMTA, it's very, very strong"
89,"And if you think about the utilization, it's not just in academic centers for treatment of first-line lung"
90,It's also in the community-based physicians
91,"There, they're very comfortable using chemotherapy"
92,So I think the combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with the strong efficacy data that we have will continue to be a very strong position for us
93,Obviously we have to see what data comes out and what the results would be
94,"But as Roger said, the bar is very high with the data we have"
95,And I feel good about our position in lung today and as we move forward
96,"And then, Tim, this is Adam"
97,"So anecdotally, we're hearing very positive comments"
98,"And we're hearing the comments on 021G not just from academic centers and physicians, but also in the community-based area"
99,And the key is that we have an approved FDA indication and we have NCCN recommendation
100,So I don't have data yet to support anything other than what we're hearing from the field
101,But everything we're hearing is positive at this point
102,And I would expect that the combination will be used increasingly more often as we move forward
103,Yeah
104,Good morning
105,So if you look at first-line lung
106,"First, let me give you a sense of testing"
107,Right now in the United States we believe that more than three-quarters of patients are being tested
108,"If you look at Europe, we believe that it's two-thirds of patients are currently being tested, where a country like the UK is about 90%, Germany is about 65%"
109,"So there's no doubt that we are seeing on a global basis, including Japan, significant increases in testing"
110,And it's really becoming standard of care to test patients for their status
111,"With regard to first-line lung, we are the leader right now in first-line lung for new patient starts"
112,"And we have about a 26% overall share, which is higher than any of the other products in first-line setting"
113,"And the majority of it I believe is based on -024, because we're just in the midst of launching the 021G results"
114,Okay
115,"So let me talk about MSI-high just a bit, Tony"
116,"So first of all, we're really working hard to increase the awareness for MSI testing and the value of KEYTRUDA across the tumor types"
117,"And after the June approval, there's certainly health care professional awareness that were hearing"
118,But it's too early to see that translate into sales
119,It's really been detected across a lot of different cancer types
120,"Some that are uncommon, like biliary tract cancer"
121,"And some that are very common, like colorectal cancer"
122,"If you look, MSI-high, it really is an established biomarker"
123,And it's used often in something like colorectal cancer or endometrial cancer
124,But it's not really done in many of the other tumor types
125,So we have still a lot of work that we have to do to educate the importance of testing for those other tumor types
126,And I would expect over time that this will continue to be an interesting and important indication
127,"But it's going to take time to build, frankly"
