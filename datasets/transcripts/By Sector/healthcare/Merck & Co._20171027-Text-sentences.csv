0,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone"
1,This morning I'll provide highlights on the Performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter
2,And my comments will be on a constant currency basis
3,"Global Human Health delivered sales of $9.2 billion, a decline of 4%, primarily driven by the loss of exclusivity for several products"
4,"We continue to see strong underlying growth from launch products, including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION"
5,"Now I'll highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology"
6,This is an exciting time for Merck as a global leader in immuno-oncology
7,We remain focused on executing on the extensive opportunity that we have with KEYTRUDA
8,"And we are also excited about the growth opportunity for LYNPARZA, which we have begun co-marketing globally with AstraZeneca"
9,I'll start with KEYTRUDA
10,"Worldwide sales for KEYTRUDA in the quarter exceeded $1 billion for the first time, making KEYTRUDA the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio"
11,"And in 2017 alone, we have launched six new indications in the U.S"
12,", four in Europe, and three in Japan"
13,", more new patients now start on KEYTRUDA than any other I-O agent across all indications"
14,"With 10 indications in six tumor types and MSI-high cancers, U.S"
15,KEYTRUDA sales grew to just over $600 million in the quarter
16,"Although there was some noise in the channel this quarter, as distributors normalized their inventory levels, if you look at the most recent script data, we have seen substantial growth in demand both year over year as well as quarter over quarter"
17,"We continued to build on our leadership position in lung cancer with growth driven by continued adoption of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in high expressers, as well as the uptake of the KEYTRUDA/ALIMTA combination in the first-line setting"
18,"Across all of lung cancer, nearly one in three new lung cancer patients in the U.S"
19,"are being started on KEYRUDA, making it the most prescribed treatment for new metastatic lung cancer patients"
20,"Lung cancer was our largest tumor type, but indications outside of lung cancer contributed to approximately 45% of U.S"
21,sales
22,"In addition to continued leadership position in melanoma and head and neck cancer, we have seen strong momentum for the bladder cancer launch"
23,"Within just two months in the second line or greater setting, KEYTRUDA achieved I-O leadership in new Rx share, despite being the fifth market entrant"
24,"Outside of the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain a leadership position in the PD-1 class in melanoma"
25,"And we are seeing a greater contribution from lung cancer, as reimbursement is established in additional markets in the first-line and second-line settings"
26,"Following our recent 1bladder cancer approval in Europe, we're now also working through the reimbursement process for this indication in each country"
27,"Early performance in Japan is also strong, with PD-L1 testing rates in lung cancer consistent with that in the U.S"
28,"Altogether, we see great opportunity for KEYTRUDA around the world, and we remain focused on establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundation for the treatment of cancer"
29,We also began working side by side with our colleagues at AstraZeneca and are ramping up our sales force to support the ongoing launch of LYNPARZA
30,We are excited about the opportunity we see with the broader label in ovarian cancer
31,And we're looking forward to the upcoming opportunity in metastatic breast cancer
32,Now I'll move to JANUVIA
33,"Global sales for the JANUVIA franchise were $1.5 billion, a decline of 2%"
34,"While we saw volume growth globally, we also experienced continued pricing pressure as we've discussed for the last several years"
35,"While we expect pricing pressure to continue, macro trends support volume growth going forward, especially outside of the U.S"
36,"As a result, we view our diabetes franchise as a relatively stable foundation from which to grow our portfolio of new products"
37,Moving now to our Vaccine business
38,Global sales were $1.9 billion with growth outside of the U.S
39,", including the contribution from the European JV termination"
40,Underlying demand for GARDASIL remains strong
41,And increased patient starts are helping to offset the negative impact in the transition to the two-dose regimen in the U.S
42,GARDASIL worldwide sales would have grown in the quarter absent our borrowing from the stockpile
43,"Based on current trends, we are confident in the continuous supply in the U.S"
44,going forward
45,"We continue to see opportunities for growth in our Vaccine business, particularly from the continued strength in GARDASIL as we move into the next year"
46,Moving now to Hospital and Specialty
47,"The ZEPATIER launch progressed well in the quarter with growth driven by Europe, Japan, and the U.S"
48,"However, we recognize the evolving marketplace and competitive landscape"
49,"And while we remain focused on maximizing its potential, we expect significant pressure on ZEPATIER throughout the remainder of this year and into next year"
50,"Finally, BRIDION delivered another great quarter with growth of more than 30%, driven by strong demand in most markets around the world, including the ongoing launch in the U.S"
51,We have seen nearly 95% repurchasing from top accounts in the U.S
52,", which demonstrates the market's continued positive experience with BRIDION"
53,"In closing, our results show the benefit from our strong execution and the contribution from launches"
54,We have good momentum in our global oncology and Vaccine businesses in addition to others
55,And we believe these franchises position us well for success heading into 2018.
56,Now I'll turn the call over to Roger
57,"And to answer your question regarding the uptake in lung cancer, I mean in the United States and also in Japan, we're seeing a very strong uptake in lung cancer"
58,"And if you look at the high expressers above 50, we're seeing significant utilization of KEYTRUDA monotherapy"
59,"If you look at expressers between 1 and 50, that's where we're seeing increased use of the combination with ALIMTA"
60,"We're hearing that now that it's in our label, physicians are being more comfortable to prescribe the combination therapy"
61,We're hearing that a lot in the community sector where they treat most of the lung cancer patients
62,"And they're used to using chemotherapy, so they feel very comfortable with the combination"
63,"In addition, what we're really trying to work on now is in the non-expressers or in the patients that are not PD-L1 tested to reinforce that we have the indication for the combination to be used in those patients, which we think represents an additional significant opportunity"
64,And we're spending a lot of time educating physicians on those patient types
65,"To give you a rough estimate, we think about 55% of our sales are coming from lung cancer in the U.S"
66,", about 20% melanoma, 10% head and neck, 5% bladder, and then 10% everything else"
67,"And with regard to lung, we continue to see good progress"
68,"And in the EU, we've worked really hard to increase the number of patients being tested for PD-L1 status"
69,"And as you look across the various countries, we're seeing the pickup very significantly"
70,"So in Germany, it's over 60% already"
71,"In the UK, it's greater than 90%"
72,Our focus right now is really continuing to work through the reimbursement process for first-line and second-line lung
73,"And each and every month, we have new countries that are coming on"
74,And we're getting more and more reimbursement
75,We'll have to wait ultimately to see more about KEYNOTE-021G before we can comment
