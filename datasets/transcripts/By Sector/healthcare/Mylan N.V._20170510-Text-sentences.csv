6,"This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated"
7,The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance
8,Tony will provide an update on this topic shortly
9,"In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion"
10,This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business
11,These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products
12,"As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower priced authorized generic"
13,"Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%"
14,"This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America"
15,"In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%"
16,The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda

18,We also continued to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region
19,"In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%"
20,This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda
21,"In addition, net sales from existing products increased, as high volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment"
22,"We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise, with double digits year-over-year growth"
23,We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world

25,We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan
26,"With now three quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well-positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets"
27,"With regards to our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere"
28,we operate
29,"FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome"
30,"For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way"
31,"As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India"
32,We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible
33,"Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter"
34,"At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the three sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters"
35,The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF [Specialty Formulation Facility] and SPD [Sterile Product Division] sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL
36,"[Onco Therapies Limited] site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA"
37,"I note that during the quarter, we had 15 inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities"
38,"In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP compliance certificate"

40,"We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin glargine"
41,"As a reminder, during the quarter we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan, and Mexico"
42,This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world commencing on the license effective dates
43,"As of this quarter, we now have approval for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets"
44,"On the respiratory front, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus"
45,"We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents a full review of the ANDA from all FDA disciplines"
46,"Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL"
47,"We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL"
48,"In any event, the agency has again explicitly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority"
49,"For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with the FDA before we can comment further upon the potential impact of the CRL"
50,"Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair and that demand for this product will be strong"
51,I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval
52,"It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of 2016, and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing"
53,"Turning to Copaxone, we have a target action date for both the 20-milligram and 40-milligram for next month"
54,We see no reason that these dates cannot be met
55,We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA satisfaction and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA
56,"Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity"
57,And we believe that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area
58,"We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA Commissioner that this process will be a priority for him, as he assumed his new office"
59,We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts
60,Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients
61,"Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to the timing of program spend, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D"
62,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape"
63,Thank you
64,And I would just add that we have taken into consideration this alliance into our projections
65,"So let me take the easy one first, which is Copaxone, and just talk about our readiness"
66,"Yes, you will expect us to be in a state of readiness from the manufacturing point of view â€“ from commercial manufacturing point of view in anticipation of the target action dates"
67,"Regarding generic Advair, so let me reiterate that this submission was done in complete accordance to the product-specific guidance and pre-agreed protocols"
68,And we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoints or device-related studies at this juncture
69,"What we have been asked is now that some of the studies, especially the device-related studies, we have now been asked to analyze and report our findings of our study against the newly issued industry draft guidance for conduct of human practice studies â€“ draft guidance"
70,"So that's what we want to go back and discuss with FDA, and we can get this meeting any day"
71,We have been waiting for this meeting and it can happen any moment or any day
72,And we can only comment upon the potential impact of the CRL once we have these discussions behind us
73,So that's what we are waiting for before we comment upon any impact on timing
74,"Yeah, Gregg, on Advair, I mean, there is nothing in my voice you should hear that we don't feel comfortable about interpreting our data to the new guidance, but we have a difference of opinion at a policy level that agency is applying a draft guidance as against a pre-approved or pre-agreed protocol"
75,So that's what we're trying to discuss and negotiate with them because it all adds to the timing and the classification of the CRL
76,"Second, on Lantus, we are very much on track and you should expect to hear from us anytime now about our regulatory filing in USA"
77,It's too early for us
78,"We have sought a meeting and we have been told that FDA is working on to grant us a meeting, or very soon we'll hear from them"
79,And I don't want to comment anything beyond that
80,We should be able to be in a good position to talk about it once we have this meeting behind us
81,Nashik is not limited to antiretrovirals
82,Nashik is a global site and does produce some U.S
83,products and some of the U.S
84,launches will be potentially impacted by that
85,"But as I confirmed, they are not material to our overall Mylan's business"
86,There's no discussion in this complete response letter or a point being made about this being not 505(j) or being about 505(b)(2)
87,And we don't see because it is exactly â€
88,“ the product is exactly as per the guidance issue by the FDA
89,It has been accepted as 505(j)
90,So I don't want to even think and comment about that because it's not real
91,So I don't want to speculate on that
92,"And, Umer, Vytorin launch has been impacted by the Nashik warning letter"
93,And I think that one of the questions was do we see any more government instituted price cuts and all that
94,"No, Marc, we don't see at this time what we saw a few years back"
95,And this Meda acquisition and Abbott acquisition has so well positioned us to leverage anything we drop in and add on to that platform now
96,"And, Andrew, regarding business development, we are executing to the plan, which we shared with you on our Investor Day"
97,"We have a very exciting and active and rich pipeline, which we are trying to close certain deals and bring products home"
98,So we see many tuck-in opportunities out there
99,"And, Chris, as I earlier mentioned, it will be prudent for us to wait for this dialogue before we comment on the potential impact on any timing our Advair launch"
100,"And with regarding your question on Neulasta, you can expect us to have this product end of â€"
101,“ towards the end of 2018 or early 2019.
102,Thank you
