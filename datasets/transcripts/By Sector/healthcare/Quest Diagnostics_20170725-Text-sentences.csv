1,This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy
2,Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2017 guidance
3,We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth
4,Here are some highlights
5,Revenues grew approximately 2% on a reported basis and 2.3% on an equivalent basis
6,"Reported EPS of $1.37 was flat from 2016, and adjusted EPS grew approximately 16% to $1.55, which includes an increase of $0.08 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation"
7,"Based upon our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook for revenues, EPS, and cash from operations for the full year 2017."
8,"Before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, what I'd like to do is briefly discuss PAMA"
9,"This month, a number of ACLA Board members met with the executive branch as well as key members of the Senate Finance Committee, that means energy and commerce held subcommittees, reiterating our belief that the current regulation effectively excludes hospital outreach labs, which are a significant segment of the laboratory marketplace"
10,"Last month our trade associations sent a letter to CMS recommending postponing the calculation of publication of the new clinical and fee schedule redefining the definition of then applicable laboratory to ensure in a good hospital outreach laboratories and upon gathering data from hospital outreach laboratories publishing new clinical and fee schedule rates effective not earlier than July 1, 2018."
11,"While we support reform of the Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories"
12,"At this point, we have made a strong case to CMS and Congress"
13,"While we continue to believe that CMS has not carried out the congressional intent of PAMA, we recognize that a new clinical and fee schedule could be in place by January of 2018 and we will be prepared"
14,Now let's review progress we've made executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence
15,"In the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth"
16,"The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we expect to achieve for the fifth consecutive year"
17,We built out our leadership position in advanced diagnostics with our recently completed acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point
18,"Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems"
19,"On May 1, we completed our acquisition of the outreach operations at PeaceHealth Laboratories and began managing 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest"
20,We began to recognize revenues from this acquisition in the POS agreement in the second quarter
21,"Our existing professional lab services relationships with hospital systems such as RWJBarnabas, HCA, Montefiore, also continue to perform well and drive revenue growth"
22,The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation
23,Our acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point will not only accelerate Quest growth in U.S
24,oncology diagnostics
25,but also host the promise of improving cancer care
26,Quest will become the preferred provider of the U.S
27,oncology diagnostics for the U.S
28,"oncology network consisting of more than 1,400 independent community-based physicians"
29,"In addition, Quest will be a preferred provider of a full range of in-patient and out-patient diagnostic services for 12 hospitals of Baylor Scott & White Health in North Texas"
30,"Advanced diagnostics, including genetic and molecular-based tests as well as general diagnostics, grew in the quarter"
31,"Drivers of advanced diagnostics growth include Q-Natal, which is our offering for non-invasive prenatal screening, core infectious disease testing and Quantiferon TB testing were part of the growth"
32,"Within general diagnostics, prescription drug monitoring and Hepatitis C screening continued strong double-digit growth"
33,We recently expanded our tumor profile offer through IBM Watson Genomics for Quest Diagnostics to include a 50 gene panel
34,"With this enhanced insight, doctors can take more informed actions for treatment and feel more certain about the best path forward"
35,"Finally, last week we launched QHerit, a new genetic screening service that provides women and men with insight into genetic risk of passing on heritable disorders on to their offsprings"
36,"We also made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers"
37,Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in over 100 stores
38,We still have clear line of sight to be operating in 200 stores and now expect to reach that number by mid-2018.
39,Patient satisfaction and convenient scores are above 90% for our Safeway locations and feedback from these sites
40,remains overwhelmingly positive
41,We can't say it any better than two recent feedbacks we have received from our customers on our Safeway locations
42,"One from a network member from Alexandria, Virginia recently wrote, 'I really like the location of this Quest center at Safeway, it saves me time, grocery shopping, pharmacy, plus blood test, all in the same location"
43,"' And my personal favorite is one from Longmont, Colorado where a customer goes on to say, 'the best blood draw"
44,"I've ever had,"
45,you rock
46,' Now this is an exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer
47,More and more people are taking control of their health and asking to receive their lab results in the palm of their hand
48,"More than 4 million patients are receiving their lab results through our MyQuest mobile application, and we are on track to reach 5 million users by the end of 2017."
49,"And then finally, in late June we announced our collaboration with Walmart to help improve access to care and"
50,over time help lower healthcare cost of providing basic health care services
51,The collaboration will initially launch at approximately 15 Walmart stores in Florida and Texas by the end of 2017.
52,These cobranded sites will initially provide laboratory testing services and over time offers are expected to expand to include other basic healthcare services
53,"In the future, these services will help us deliver on the fifth element of our growth strategy, which is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services"
54,"Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion in invigorate run-rate savings as we exit 2017."
55,"As we indicated at our Investor Day last fall, we also believe we will be able to generate additional savings beyond 2017."
56,"As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience"
57,We are e-enabling our processes behind the scenes as well as in our patient service centers
58,More than 600 patient services are now live with e-check-in
59,"We plan to deliver this digital experience to over 1,000 patient service centers by the end of this year"
60,"At these locations, patients use a tablet to sign in for their appointment, and are provided with an estimated wait time"
61,They know they are in the system and when they will be seen
62,So that's good for patients
63,", it's good for us too"
64,"On the back end of this system, data provides us real-time insight into patients' flow, enabling us to direct phlebotomists to the locations where they are needed most"
65,"Since we introduced this service earlier this year, more than 7 million people have utilized this service to date"
66,"Finally, 2017 is our 50th anniversary of empowering better health with diagnostic insights"
67,"We've had numerous events around the Company to mark the occasion, and our employees have enjoyed engaging with former leaders and learning more about our history"
68,"We are proud of our 50 year legacy and look forward to promoting a healthy world, building value, and creating an inspiring workplace over the next fifty years"
69,"So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark"
70,and he will take us through our financial performance in more detail
71,Mark?
72,We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth
73,"Based on our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook and are well positioned to meet our expectations"
74,"So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions"
75,Operator?
76,Question-and-Answer Session
77,"First of all, as we said in the past, we look at a lot of different external measures"
78,Then we do an internal measure where we look at our same account measurement where we do a measurement where we know we have a good account
79,and we look at year-on-year comparison of volumes
80,"And what we've said in the past remains this quarter, we think the underlying volume in the market is stable, is the best way to summarize it"
81,"And then to your second point about volume in the quarter, as you know we don't guide on volumes, we do guide on revenues and"
82,"it's important that we continue to drive revenue growth, it's what we are entirely focused on"
83,So I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little bit of color around what's in the mix
84,Mark?
85,I appreciate that
86,"As we've talked about and raised the case, when we engage with a healthcare system integrated delivery network, we talk about three things"
87,"First of all, what we can do to help them with their in-patient laboratory, and that's what we refer to as professional laboratory services engagement"
88,"The second part of this is the inside diagnostics that I referenced, testing, and we believe we could be very effective provider of more and also help them with what they do, so a significant part of the discussion"
89,"And then the third case is that we are in that discussion to decide what their strategy is from hospital outreach, and [indiscernible]"
90,is a good example of that
91,"where we bought their operating [indiscernible], we're helping them with 11 of their hospital in-patient laboratories"
92,"And to your specific question, in that relationship we are also helping them with the reference work as well"
93,"So, in all these engagements, we typically become a stronger presence in that account for reference work"
94,Thanks for asking
95,We are quite excited about it as well
96,There are a lot of different reasons
97,"That goes down there last week, we had our date one [indiscernible] with a town hall meeting and spent some time with the management team"
98,So this acquisition actually kicks four elements of our accelerated growth strategy
99,"First of all, obviously it's part of our growth through acquisition, so that's good news"
100,"Second is in terms of innovation, it brings to us"
101,"a nice [indiscernible] up our portfolio around what we could do around oncology and precision medicine, so we are encouraged about that"
102,"Third is to your point, it brought it to present in the second largest state in the country, Texas, where we already have a strong presence"
103,"And then with this, it's all about providing better health care at better cost levels, and we think with some of the work they've done in the engagement for instance with U.S"
104,"Oncology, we can help with the data and understanding what we would do to form better cancer care, so four elements of our strategy"
105,So we are encouraged by that
106,"And the relationship in Texas is strong, and so we are deeply engaged how we continue on what they built with that engagement and continue to grow from that given our broader presence now with us at Quest Diagnostics"
107,So we're excited about it
108,and we think it's a great acquisition as well
109,So thanks for the question
110,"So first of all , we study with two of the largest states, Texas and Florida"
111,"We also have a strong presence in Florida, so two nice states, second and third largest state now in the country for us to make progress in the large states"
112,"Yes, we will look at some of their sectors for our patient service centers, but as importantly, what I said in my introductory remarks is, we are actually going to use this strong metric to provide some of the basic healthcare services that help with what we could do with population [indiscernible] to cost curve"
113,So what are some of those things?
114,"Now can we help with people dealing with hypertension and do blood pressure checks, can we make sure that people are staying out their [indiscernible] beyond a diuretic suffering, congested heart failure, that we help you with that by periodically taking your weight, making sure you stay in your diuretic staying range"
115,We can also help with diabetes management
116,We're also working with some of the healthcare insurance companies where we could close gaps in care to help them with their quality scores so they get reimbursed by the healthcare that we all know is the best healthcare
117,"So those are the basic healthcare services, and fortunately at Quest, we have the world's largest laboratory, so we'll be, absent for the last five years"
118,", we are in the field of diagnostic information services"
119,"We have over 20,000 health care workers, 10,000 [indiscernible] with 10,000 other health care workers that provide services already for wellness services from Florida that help insurance companies"
120,We are also providing health checks for life insurance pre-qualification physicals and checks
121,"So, we are leveraging those resources and its relationship as well"
122,"So, we are excited about it"
123,"We think it's a great opportunity for us to just expand our already unsurpassed access to the marketplace, but also engage with the ecosystem healthcare with some of these basic customer services that can in our mind really help them to cost curve for healthcare in populations that are difficult to get access to"
124,"So the current schedule as you know, we submitted the data already"
125,That was delayed by two months because their portal was not available and so we recognized they'd listen to us and postpone it
126,We have put it in our data
127,Those people that are submitting the data have done that by the end of May
128,"The current schedule thereon is to publish tentative rates in September, so the schedule that they currently have published"
129,"However, we have shared with them that we believe that several things are going on with the data they had collected"
130,"One is they haven't included all the data from those laboratories that they are buying from, typically hospital outreach"
131,"We believe their approach still limits the size of the sample, and we shared that"
132,"And also this has been reinforced by the officer and Inspector General that [indiscernible] that only 5% of the laboratories are being asked to submit data will submit data, which is about 69% of what they actually buy from"
133,The second is what we have heard from some of the smaller laboratory association that affect some of the data input
134,So we have shared this with them because some of the smaller laboratories did not have good access to retrospective data
135,"And while our concern is that they use that data for the basis of publishing at tentative [indiscernible] fee schedule in the fall, it won't be right"
136,"So our strong recommendation to them, and we have got word from Congress broadly, many different leaders of Congress as well as the center [indiscernible], we believe the best thing for us all is to take some time to get it right"
137,So our recommendation is to postpone it
138,We have made a recommendation of how we believe they could collect the data
139,That will take some time
140,"We think if they work in that aggressively, they possibly could publish the due clinical and fee schedule no earlier than July of 2018."
141,"So that's the path we are on, but the current schedule we have is that they are going to extend the schedule to get out some rates in the fall with the refresh clinical and fee schedule in the first of next year, and as we said in our introductory remarks, we are prepared for that but working hard because we believe it does not reflect the impression or intent to get a full sampling of the marketplace and get that data in a good form and get good quality data to establish a rate for itself"
142,So we are pushing that in a big way across the trade association
143,We continue to be excited about the prospect here
144,"And again, to start at the highest level of possible systems, and I have shared in the past their lab strategies are on the shortlist of strategic things they are talking about"
145,And so they welcome meetings with us to help them think through this
146,"And in that context, a big part of this is how we can help them become more efficient with their hospital in-patient laboratory, and it is that spectrum"
147,"The broadest capability is we help them manage it, the leverage of our procurement"
148,They also learn from our best practices of running the world's largest laboratory
149,"And to answer your question about across that spectrum, where is that set, I would say it's equally distributed across the lowest level of involvement, the most no predominant necessarily of one end of that spectrum"
150,"But to your last question, once we get in the account and we begin to develop the relationship, we do see increased levels of engagement by the customer with us and we do broaden our services broadly and we do spend more time on what we'd do to help with them their reference work, and then also in that context, we do continue the conversation about their outreach strategy if they are in the outreach business"
151,"So, the way we see it is we start with an engagement"
152,but that's just the beginning of engagement
153,"And then we also use this as a discussion broadly of what we could do for them in terms of what their mission is and their strategy, which gets us into discussion about population health and"
154,what we could do in data analytics
155,"We've got a lot of capabilities there, we have talked about that in the past, we've seen a nice value-added"
156,"These new extended care services are of great interest, particularly those integrated delivery system, that are taking on risk [indiscernible]"
157,they are quite interested and probably can leverage these access points for putting in place with our two [indiscernible] with Walmart is one example
158,"So, this strategy is really a strategy of how we serve possible systems in a bigger way, and one aspect of what we could do with them is around their professional answers is engagement in their in-patient laboratory, but it's much broader than that"
159,"Now what we talked about five years ago just for the world's largest laboratory, but the business that we want to focus on is Diagnostic Information Services"
160,"And so, the information and the services portion of our portfolio is the big portion of what we've really put our shoulder into over the last several years, and you are seeing some of the contributions in the way of business in the last few years"
161,So let me just walk through what that means and
162,where do we see this going
163,"So in that strategy, we believe that hospital systems were becoming stronger"
164,We knew that hospitals were acquiring physician practices
165,"And therefore it was quite important for us rather than thinking about the hospitals as primarily a competitor, we thought [indiscernible] partner with them with their lab strategy, and that has worked well"
166,They are all over trying to become more efficient
167,They are trying to understand how they can provide better patient care
168,"And then finally, they are realizing that being in the outreach business is not necessarily something that they all want to focus on and therefore they can team up with us"
169,and we're a good provider of that
170,So it's a nice service [indiscernible]
171,"And then as we get in, similar to what I said to Donald in the last question, it's all about their strategy and their strategy is to be a broader provider of integrated health services within a geography, and we could help them with that"
172,So we have brought out a broad line of information products
173,"We launched this a couple of years ago with the [indiscernible], we call it Quanum"
174,"And in that portfolio of products, we offer capabilities to take a look at your utilization for diagnostics, allows the data to be put on the table to ask questions about are we doing a proper work-up to make sure we have an informed decision that happens, that [indiscernible] what happens next in healthcare, which is an important part of delivering good health care at lower cost"
175,"Second is we also served up with a nice access to the workflow within the physicians workflow, the ability to look at all past data from our relationship with [indiscernible], and that data we think is valuable to get a full view of what happens to that patient"
176,So those data analytic services I think are helpful
177,So that's the conversation we also get into
178,"And as we work on this discussion, they are all interested in how they retain their current patients and grow the patient population as well as their membership, and we all see that there is a sea change happening where the consumer is much more engaged and that's why we think it's very important for us"
179,and we put a lot of energy on broadening and expanding our brand and
180,what we believe our brand stands for
181,"As a matter of fact, we have talked about our brand and our tagline being action from inside"
182,"Our vision is to have better health with diagnostic insight, not just [indiscernible]"
183,"So in that consumer strategy, which is part of our growth strategy, there's multiple aspects to that"
184,One is the migrating access
185,So we believe our retail strategy helps us with that
186,"We started with Safeway, we said we're going to do more, we recently announced our relationship with Walmart"
187,So we think that's expanding our access
188,Second is to provide products that are consumer-oriented
189,We have talked in the past earnings call about what we're doing to be a provider of testing directly to consumers
190,"We have launched a pilot, we're doing some of that in Arizona"
191,"We are now expanding that pilot of selling testing where states allow it to be done, to Missouri, to Colorado"
192,We have a great business that's growing around wellness
193,We have a product coupled for wellness
194,We have expanded that to the field of sports where we have the sport diagnostic product
195,We have done the work with [indiscernible]
196,So there's a whole portfolio of more consumer-oriented products that we've rolled out as well
197,"And then we have also improved on the access and consumers remarkably want to have all their health information, and frankly we're quite surprised by the pickup of our MyQuest application, I mentioned in my introductory remarks over 4 million of people have registered with us"
198,We believe we are tracking to be on track to get above 5 million users
199,"So, if you look at all those elements, we believe that this positions us nicely as that diagnostic information services company that's thought of when the consumer will have [indiscernible] the diagnostic testing, and over time we believe with better transparency, because we do offer we believe one of the strongest [indiscernible] proposition in the marketplace, the physician will ask the consumer which laboratory do you want to test and to go to"
200,and they will remember this great experience that they had at Quest Diagnostics
201,They will have information that's provided to them
202,"They will have access to products and they will be able to easily access our capabilities, and so the choice will be given to us, and that's our strategy"
203,We picked up the powerful element of our strategy and it's where healthcare is headed
204,Consumers will have more choice and consumers will direct more at healthcare
205,"So we are making a lot of progress, we're excited about it"
206,"and we think that's going to help us with our core business today but over time it will become a larger piece of our portfolio over time that we really do direct healthcare in a better way where it is needed, which is not necessarily only in hospitals but throughout the health care system and communities that are touched not by traditional healthcare but other places like our retail strategy"
207,So that's where we are going with it
208,"Part of our discussion with these hospital systems were on their lab strategy, they see pressure on rates broadly"
209,"They are feeling pressure from their commercial insurance relationships, but they also are looking forward and realizing that the clinical and fee schedule will be refreshed"
210,"And as we talked about in the past, they have more exposure than we do to that"
211,Roughly 12% of our revenues is a much more meaningful percentage of their laboratory revenues
212,"So, when we engage in these conversations, one aspect of their consideration of what they are going to run [indiscernible] is they are going to be under pressure both on the commercial side as well as on Medicare"
213,"But the other aspect as you know is related to what their strategy is, do we want to put more capital and increasing more complicated area, and in some cases they decide not to"
214,"Second is they realize that our scale is significant and as we move away from a fee-for-service model to a much more value based reimbursement model, it's still longer to be in activity, it's going to be making sure we have the best cost per service unit and our cost structure is far superior than any other cost structure"
215,"So, in many of the cases we are engaged around this and"
216,"in some cases where we have bought their [indiscernible] business, it's because they see reimbursement changing and they believe that they have to move to team up with someone like Quest that has a very efficient model delivering the necessary diagnostic services, so as part of that overall strategy for the integrated delivery system, a part of this is looking at pressure and range, but it's more comprehensive than that as well, Issac"
217,"Yes, so we shared this at our Investor Day"
218,"Look at the market we compete in, ourselves and the nearest competitor, less than 25% share"
219,We have a very compelling value proposition where we offer some of the best pricing
220,"and we believe best service and quality on the planet, and we believe we should have more share"
221,We're working hard at gaining that organically
222,but we are also believing that we can consolidate more of this marketplace and that's why we have the strategy of 1% to 2% growth through those strategic [indiscernible] acquisitions
223,"We have announced a number this year with [indiscernible], we're moving forward down with Med Fusion and also we also announced recently [indiscernible] in Massachusetts"
224,So our march continues to drive that strategy
225,So we think the commercial rate pressure on the rest of the marketplace will help accelerate the strategy we are on and we should over time take up more share both organically and through acquisitions
226,"I can't handicap it, but I will share that we are actively working the communication with CMS, and when I say we, it's the Board of Directors and all members of ACLA are actively talking to our Congress members both on House side as well as the Senate side"
227,We have also met a couple of times with the leadership at CMS
228,"The leadership at CMS understands this well, understands that the current approach has issues associated with it, and our simple messaging on this is take the time to get it right"
229,We continue to support the idea of paying or having CMS pay market-based pricing
230,"To get the right data, take the right approach to bringing on those rates is important for all of us"
231,And what we remind them of is the reason why we have PAMA
232,"is reflective of the work that's to protect access to Medicare Act, and it's important for Congress"
233,and it's part of their congressional [intent]
234,"[ph] not to just pay at the lowest rates but to make sure that they pay for what they use, and the reason for this is there's many parts of this country that are not served by the large national laboratories"
235,"And the concern that they are now aware of is if in fact, if this is not done in the right way, rates could be cut, smaller labs that are very necessary in smaller rural areas, in some segment of the marketplace"
236,"the majority of what the testing is has provided the Medicare marketplace could be substantially cut, and the example of that is what's happening in nursing homes where a majority of their single testing is basically the most routine tests that are done for many small laboratories all over this country"
237,So we remind Congress and we remind CMS of where we started and why we believe paying market based price is quite important
238,"So, what I'll share is we think they are very, very responsive to listening to our concerns"
239,We realize there is an element of administration
240,They realize that what was put in place was put in place over the last couple of years
241,They realize there is an opportunity to work with us to get it right
242,So we remain hopeful
243,but I can't handicap it
244,"We have been at a point where we don't have the capacity to do deals that make sense and we spend a lot of time looking at deals, we say no to more deals than we say yes to"
245,It's important
246,We continue to go back to our philosophy on doing acquisitions
247,They have to be strategically aligned and also we have to make money on those deals
248,And a key part of making money on those deals is making sure we have the right integration plan
249,"And so, as we integrate this, we have a small structural team that helps us with the integration but also a large part of the integration happens in our regions as well"
250,"And so, if you look at the distribution of some of these deals, they have been distributed throughout the United States"
251,We have done a number up in the north
252,"[Indiscernible] being one example of that, Harvard Health Care being another example, but most recently we are doing this deal out in our western region with PeaceHealth"
253,and we are working on that with enough capacity to pull that off
254,"So, our capacity has not been [indiscernible] at all"
255,It's more the [indiscernible] factor to making sure we have deals that we believe are strategically aligned and we could make money on
256,I appreciate that
257,"First of all, the relationship is getting nowhere near"
258,"We said we are going to focus on two largest states, Florida and Texas, and we're going to pick 15 sites that will be our initial pilot sites"
259,"And what we'll provide at those sites are some of our patient service center capabilities like we've done with Safeway, but we believe there's more we could do on those sites with basic healthcare services"
260,"And what will specifically get done is really dependent upon where we forge relationships with healthcare insurance companies, their integrated delivery systems for ACOs within those geographies where we think there could be some value of providing with basic healthcare services in those great access points that Walmart has"
261,This will be a joint venture
262,We are the majority holder of ownership in that joint venture
263,"We have not provided visibility or guidance of how large this will be, but we are hopeful that this year we'll be off to a good start and we'll share more in due course as we get into it"
264,"The second part of your question, as we said when we announced Safeway, Safeway was an excellent relationship"
265,We are proud of what we have done
266,"We are half way into what fully we can realize, about 100 stores, we've got another 100 to go to get to 200."
267,What we are doing with Walmart we think is complementary and every one of the retail strategies that are â€“ retail companies that are in our space have a different strategy
268,So we continue to enjoy a nice good working relationship with [CBS]
269,[ph]
270,[indiscernible]
271,We believe Walgreens has a different strategy as well
272,"And what we will do is â€“ Walmart and what we will do with Safeway, we believe there are other ways we could work with other retailers that could be complementary to what we agree to do with these two that we have announced so far"
273,We are working our way through that
274,The Safeway relationship is different than what we're going to do at Walmart
275,and we already have working relationships with some other retailers
276,"I mentioned CBS and Walgreens, different strategies, all these have different strategies"
277,"And frankly, I think we'd like to have a handful of strong national brands that we work with"
278,We'd like to make some progress with those before we expand too broadly
279,So we have two now and working relationships with others
280,"So, we are totally focused on executing against what we've said we would do with Safeway"
281,We feel good about that
282,We just launched this new relationship with Walmart
283,We want to make sure we make progress in 2017.
284,"And as far as others, in due course we will talk about that as we work with them on their own trend, [indiscernible] how we could be helpful, but a good way of thinking about this, we started with one, we've now moved to two and a handful will be a good number that we could then manage over time to provide what we do and help them with their health strategy"
285,So we are open to working with others
286,We want to make sure that what we do doesn't in any way contradict what we are doing with some other partners
287,"But as you know, Walgreens continues to broaden their health presence"
288,They have a working relationship as you know with Med Express
289,Med Express will provide healthcare services and that strategy will change over time
290,"And as you know, most of these retailers work with all different brands, no matter what category and laboratory services are going to be different"
291,"So, they are selling all different bands in their stores, so therefore they are open to different brands and we believe that this strategy is good for us to think about how we could team up with different people in the ecosystem in healthcare and every one of these players has different strategy"
292,"So, we think there is an opportunity here as well"
293,"Okay, so that concludes our day"
294,We had a strong first half in 2017.
295,"We look forward to continue to meet our commitments by executing our two-point strategy, which is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence"
296,We appreciate your time on this call and we hope you have a great day
