Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders that joining us today as we review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results
I will then cover some business highlights and discuss some key announcements this quarter
Then I will hand the call over to Brett Sandercock, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail
We are very grateful to our global team for a very strong performance this quarter
We achieved double-digits global revenue growth led by sales of our software solutions, our mask systems and our sleep apnea devices
At the bottom line, we grew operating profit 12% and our diluted earnings per share was $0.66 on a non-GAAP basis
We are proud of this solid top and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team
Brightree’s growth continues to be strong at 15% year-on-year inclusive of tuck-in acquisitions
We are making great progress as we expand our connected care offerings for all of our customers creating efficiencies and improving patient outcomes
Now let me cover some geographic business highlights
, Canada and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth at 11%
These results were fueled by strong growth in devices and masks as well continued double-digit software sales growth
Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily
Growth in devices in these countries was 8% for the quarter
It has been over three years since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions cloud-based software and we continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find ongoing sustainable value from our connected care solutions
The masks and accessories category grew 13% in the U.S
, Canada and Latin America countries this quarter
We've seen good demand across all mask categories
The AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 masks are performing well and we are able to fully supply the fast growing demand for these products
Our brand new AirTouch F20 is in its very early days and has high patients comfort ratings right out of the gate
Device sales in the combined European and Asian countries were up a very strong 9% this quarter on a constant currency basis
ResMed France achieved very strong device growth catalyzed by the announcement of increased reimbursement for telemonitored sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices
We expect to continue our connected care value creation for our customers across Europe and Asia Pacific as we expand digital help and connected care globally
Across Europe and Asia, our teams achieved strong mask growth of 15% this quarter
We expect ongoing growth based on continued adoption of our recent mask technology and positive customer feedback across the spectrum: patients, physicians and homecare providers
I’ll now take a few minutes to update you on our three horizons 2020 growth strategy and then I will hand the call over to Brett
In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products enhanced by digital health and connected care
We now have over six million patients monitored with AirView software and over four million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices on their bedside tables
In addition, we have seen over 1,300 new patients’ signup for the myAir patient engagement app every single day
It turns out consumers love seeing their own data
We are expanding globally with our connected care solutions translating the value creation that we have brought to our customers in the U.S
over to France and across Europe and beyond
In September, we featured our recently launched travel CPAP solutions, the ResMed AirMini at the European Respiratory Society Conference in Milan
There continues to be the demand and interest for a category of small travel-friendly second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash
We are focused on growing this category all around the world with particular success in existing cash pay markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada and the UK
This quarter ResMed and Brightree launched another integration solution
Together, we provide a seamless solution for all homecare providers through automated resupply enrollment for patients managed by both Brightree Connect and AirView software
With this enhancement, AirView automatically alerts Brightree Connect once the patient has achieved compliance criteria
So that the patients can be automatically enrolled into the Brightree Connect resupply program
This feature helps our homecare customers to ensure that every sleep apnea patient is getting the supplies that they need in order to have the best possible therapy experience while saving the customer labor costs through software automation
This enhancement is the latest in a growing list of time saving features for our customers that maximize both the patient benefits as well as homecare provider benefits
Brightree also launched ConnectPRO at the Medtrade Industry Conference just earlier this week
ConnectPRO is a comprehensive solution that combines all technology services and data analytics that are necessary for our homecare customers to efficiently manage resupply workflows and to improve patients' resupply engagement
Our connected care strategy is also having a positive impact on the clinical front with ongoing publication of studies
The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine known more simply as The Blue Journal published a study run jointly by ResMed and Kaiser Permanente, which reported that remote monitoring improve the patient adherence to sleep apnea therapy
The key takeaway from the study was that telemonitoring of sleep apnea patients with ResMed's algorithms resulted in an increase of therapy adherence of 22% to 37%
This is statistically significant and also clinically significant data
We look forward to more publications using ResMed's database of the identified aggregated data
We are transforming big data of more than 1 billion nights of sleep metrics into actionable information that can improve clinical outcomes
Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy
Our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and light support ventilators continue to grow globally and we are building our connected care strategy for COPD
We relaunched our portable oxygen concentrator called Activox with improved quality and performance at our U.S
, Canada and Latin America Sales Conference during the quarter
We expect steady growth of Activox throughout the year and beyond
Watch this space for future enhancements of our connected COPD offering
We are driving awareness of key clinical studies that have shown improvements in COPD mortality and reductions in COPD hospitalizations such as our home oxygen therapy, home mechanical ventilation study called HOT-HMV
Our market access teams are working to change the standard of care for COPD in key countries around the world to drive future growth in non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator usage and life support ventilation businesses to serve COPD patients
Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management models and out-of-hospital software businesses
This quarter Brightree announced the appointment of Robert Dean as General Manager of our home health and hospice business within Brightree
This continues to be a very exciting area for us with lots of long term growth potential
We are expanding out-of-hospital software offerings as we continue to grow and acquire software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings
We’ve had a tremendous start to the fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenue throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond
We are encouraged by the success of our new product launches with the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20 and the ResMed AirMini
We continue to work on a pipeline of new products and enhanced connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and other critical chronic diseases
We have positioned the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020 as we continue to execute our strategy and action, drive operating excellence and pioneer market leading connected care solutions
We have improved our 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to pursue the holy grail of health care improving patients’ quality of life, slowing chronic disease progression and reducing overall health care system costs
With that I will now turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A
Over to you, Brett
Got you loud and clear, Joanne
Sure, Joanne
I’ll start and have a go then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead, the Present of our Sleep Business to talk about how we're expanding our AirMini business
Firstly, I'm a personal user of the ResMed AirMini and have been for many months
And I traveled all around the world with it and just in love with it as my new travel companion; literally anywhere I go around the planet it follows me
So that I get my great sleep apnea kit without having to get distilled water at Tokyo at 2’o clock in the morning when I land from the direct flight from San Diego
The adoption of AirMini in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and the U.K
where we have established cash pay channels has been very strong in fact far above our early expectations
Patients are really loving paying out-of-pocket for something that has provided such great care
But I’d say in our business to business to consumer markets like the U.S
where we sell to our homecare providers and then they sell cash to patients
It's been a slower ramp up as those customers start to ramp up their cash businesses with all the changes of competitive bidding in the U.S
landscape change, our homecare providers in the U.S
are loving to build their cash businesses and it's something they've been working on strategically for a number of years
And we think the ResMed AirMini along with portable oxygen concentrators is a great opportunity for them and we’re supporting them in both of that
But with that introduction to it, Jim anything further to add for the U.S
Thanks for your follow up, Joanne
We don’t go into the details of patient volume growth within geographies
What I can say and the difference maybe between us and other parts of med tech is – this is a very personal experience of suffocation before therapy and then the experience of getting that gift the breath and the life change that can happen with sleep apnea
geography with somewhere between 40 million to 60 million Americans suffocating every night and maybe we have six or seven million so far diagnosed and on treatment
We still have 85, 80 plus – 85% plus of the opportunity in front of us
So I think that a large pool of undiagnosed patients provides a regular flow into the sleep labs and into the homecare providers that allows for that sort of steady growth of patients into the channel
We've got a long way to go on that journey
And if you go to other geographies around the world, Western Europe, 85%, 90% of the opportunities still in front in terms of sufferers and getting them through the system
And in our Asia growth markets, the opportunity is above 95%, 98%, 99% in some of the geographies
So we think we’re in mile one of a marathon here and we're really excited about that, patient volume growth continuing to grow steadily not just in this quarter, but throughout the fiscal year that we expect ahead and beyond
Yeah, thanks, Dave
That's a good question
Clearly through ResMed Resupply which is part of the AirView software solutions package and part of Brightree Connect as we talked about linking on the backend with AirView
We are really working very closely with our homecare providers to make sure that every patient, who wants the mask and is qualified for a mask has the opportunity to get one
As I’m saying earlier I am a personal user of this therapy and you need to change this mask
It's a piece of plastic that touches your face every day and stays on it hopefully for seven hours of sleep every night and even with regular washing and regular drawing the mask needs replacement
And we think there's a lot of opportunity
We know there's a lot of opportunity to work with patients and empower them with the information that they have to be able to access the supplies that they need
So without going specifically into numbers, we can tell you that qualitatively the pool of installed base of customers, patients who are using masks and want to resupply them is increasing quite strongly
And it's a large part of our mask and accessories category
So, David, we probably don't want to go into the specifics of each category of masks, the installed base and new patient flow and how quickly they’re growing
But if you think about it from sort of a mathematics point of view as the installed base grows larger and larger and we work on replenishment protocols with patients and expand them, there's some linear opportunities with new patient setup and some exponential opportunities with replenishment as you engage the patients throughout the world in all sorts of different models
Got you loud and clear, Steve
And I am glad we’ve got your company right too
Yeah, Steve, as we have talked about 90 days ago, we did 90 days ago still have some supply constraints that we were just leaving at the end of Q4 throughout Q1 we were supply unconstrained
And we were able to meet and beat the very fast demand as you saw for masks throughout the world
And if you look at the masks and accessories category, it grew at 13% on a constant currency basis in the U.S
, Canada and Latin America and it grew at 15% on a constant currency basis in Europe and Asian countries
Look, we think that that we can continue to grow masks all the way throughout the fiscal year
There were all sorts of different changes that happen in terms of comparables from quarter X and quarter Y as you go through out of fiscal year
But as you think about the next twelve months and twenty four months, we think the runway of the F20, the AirFit F20, the AirFit N20, so the full phase and the nasal components are very strong
And we're just out of the gate with the AirTouch F20, which is our brand new technology which incorporates both the LSR, or liquid silicon rubber, but also foam technology
And it's early days, but patients are really loving that opportunity
And so we're working with our channel partners on the business side of it
But in terms of patient acceptance, we’re seeing some really good patient acceptance
So having said all that, I think we've got a really good runway ahead for growth throughout fiscal 2018 for our masks
I don't think it's a catch up
I think it's the start of a steady growth pattern that we should see throughout fiscal 2018, 2019 and beyond
Look, yeah, David, as I said in the prepared remarks, we just relaunched with the quality and new capability in systems around our Activox system as we’ve now incorporated that acquisition of Inova into our business and relaunched it really with our sales team this quarter
I will hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to maybe provide some further detail on our POC business
Yes
So another good question, Margaret
Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Brightree growth was 13% constant currency if you didn't include any of the tuck-in acquisitions, and it's 15% constant currency, including the modest tuck-in acquisitions that we did throughout the year AllCall and so on into Brightree
Look, yes, solid, low to mid-teen growth in our software-as-a-service business
We think that some of that is new accounts
Our sales team at Brightree is excellent
[Audio Gap] and I and a bunch of the team, Raj went out there to Atlanta to spend time with the team and in a leadership program and looking at those top not just sales but development leaders and how they're teaming up and really adapting the ResMed culture but keeping a strong Brightree software-as-a-service culture and driving a really strong commercial performance
And so we think that's sustainable, taking into account share but also growing users within existing accounts
We find that the HME providers who partnered with Brightree grow, and as they grow, they get more users
And software-as-a-service system users is paid on a per basis
So you can grow by getting new accounts
You can also grow by helping new customers grow
Yes I’ll hand it over to Rob
Thanks for the question Andrew
Clearly, over the last three, to five years, there has been some consolidation in our U.S
home care provider base, still around 5000-plus home medical equipment providers in the U.S
So quite a large and diverse group of local mom-and-pop, regionals as well as national players, and we partner with people across that spectrum
As I look at the market, I think we see a relative sampling of changes in reimbursement, some of those big step changes that happen in the early phases of the U.S
government CMS program to get in line with our private payers and now we have a sort of steady program going forward
And I think a pretty broad view at CMS that actually investing in sleep apnea care reduces long-term costs for the government, and we're certainly as I said on the AdvaMed Board of Directors, we definitely spend time in Washington letting Washington know that medical devices as an industry is able to lower long-term costs by keeping patients, particularly in sleep apnea and in COPD, out of hospital and under better care
So we're seeing a pretty steady reimbursement environment
It does have reductions, but they're reasonably steady
So I think we're able to weather that and work with our home care providers to make sure that they use Brightree and they use AirView, and they can lower their labor cost by 50%, 60%, and that's the way to free up cash to reinvest in marketing to primary care doctors and going after the 40 million, 50 million, 60 million people who are suffocating
And as yet haven't had a chance to get diagnosed, get treated and get a better quality of life
Yes thanks Andrew
I’ll handle that follow-up to Jim Hollingshead, our President of Global Sleep business
Yes
Thanks, Victor [ph]
The answer is yes
I mean, I think the sleep apnea market as we said earlier is growing in mid-to-high single digits with the devices more in that mid-single-digit range
I think we can continue to hold and grow share in the device side that will allow us to grow the sleep apnea business and that mid-single digits in the device category
And in addition to the ResMed AirMini, which is on top of that as a cash pay and the POCs, which is on top of that, there are the noninvasive ventilator devices
Where we're at on that is the early stages
There are 400 million, 500 million patients worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive preliminary disease or lung disease
Many of them remain undiagnosed or undertreated
Many of them need to get first initial drug therapy, and they need oxygen therapy and then they need non-invasive ventilation therapy
And then as their disease progresses towards more chronic care, they need life-support ventilation therapy
And so ResMed plans to be walking with those COPD patients along that channel
So this is a longer-term development
It's sort of part of our 2020 and even our 2020 strategies
We're starting to put that together and developing our connected COPD strategy, and we'll be doing that with partners across med tech and pharma and beyond
And so watch this space for longer-term growth there, but we're really excited about the growth in our core business of sleep apnea and our second Horizon of growth in COPD and our third Horizon of growth in out-of-hospital software
And if you put them all together, I think you've got a very strong and dynamic portfolio
Unidentified Analyst Okay, great
And then just a follow-up on the cash pay at kind of CPAP side that it seems that’s going better in the market ofAustralia in stage? Is that cannibalizing mainly in cash pay market with us cannibalizing sales? Or how much is there [indiscernible]?
Yes I’ll hand that to Rob
Thanks for the question, Anthony
Yes, look, I think there is some rising tide there, and that's a global mid-single digits to high-single digits market growth
And so other players are going in that mid- to high single digit range as well
As I said earlier, I do think we're taking share with connected care
You mentioned France
There is four levels of reimbursement for sleep apnea therapy that starts from January 1 in France
And the highest is telemonitored patients with adherence over 4 hours and telemonitored patients with two to four hours and then below that non-telemonitored patients, and so on
And ResMed's been leading in connected care not just in the U.S
but globally, and we've been preparing for this type of a change, and we're really excited that the government of France has recognized that they get a return on investment by telemonitoring patients, increasing adherence and taking those patients out of hospital
So we think this market is great and growing and good for all players, but we think it's particularly good for people who are looking at ways to take cost out of that channel and partner with their customers, which include the home care providers but also the patients like giving them their own data every day patients use their devices more
I mean, adherence rates of 87% is unheard of in our industry, and we're publishing that and getting it in the peer-reviewed press in the Blue Journal, Jama, Lancet and you're going to see more from us on that
We have one billion nights of sleep data in the identified aggregated data, and we're going to be putting clinical studies out there to show this therapy, sleep apnea therapy is very beneficial, and we'll be doing the same in COPD as we move forward
So I’ll handle the question to Brett
Thanks, Mariama
In closing, I want to thank the more than 6,000-strong ResMed team for their execution on our new product launches
This quarter, that hard work has translated into market share gains, revenue growth and double-digit 12% net operating profit growth
Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, including patients, physicians, payers and providers
