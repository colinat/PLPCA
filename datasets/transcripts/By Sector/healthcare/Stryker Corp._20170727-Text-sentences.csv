52,"Lastly, as it relates to our full-year operating margin improvement, NOVADAQ is anticipated to be approximately 20 basis point dilutive to our operating margin for 2017, which would partially offset the expected 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement"
53,"Now, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense"
54,Other income/expense decreased from the prior-year quarter primarily due to increased interest income
55,Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses
56,"In the second half of the year, our tax rate will benefit from certain other geographical and operational changes that, combined with the aforementioned change in accounting, will result in an anticipated effective tax rate ranging from 16% to 17%"
57,"Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities; of which, approximately 89% was held outside the U.S"

59,"Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $801 million"
60,"Also, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter"
61,"And now, I will discuss our third quarter and full-year guidance"
62,"Based on our past performance on our outlook for the remainder for the year, we now anticipate annual organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2017."
63,"As a reminder, the third quarter will have one less selling day as compared to 2016 and the fourth quarter will have the same number of selling days"
64,The full year has one less selling day
65,"If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the third quarter and full year to be negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be negatively impacted by $0.02 in the third quarter and approximately $0.10 in the full year"
66,"For 2017, our adjusted net earnings per diluted share is now expected to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.55 per share, which excludes any anticipated dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ technologies"
67,"Based on the third quarter-end close date for NOVADAQ, the dilution is estimated to be approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share"
68,"For the third quarter, we anticipate that adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55, which includes the aforementioned investment, foreign currency impact and the impact of the accounting change for stock compensation"
69,Our third quarter range does not assume any dilution related to NOVADAQ
70,"However, if the deal closes earlier than September 30, there will be additional dilution during the quarter"
71,"And now, we'll open up the call for Q&A"
72,Question-and-Answer Session
73,Yes
74,"On the component of the raise, FX is moderating"
75,"So, it won't be as big as it was in the first half"
76,"I think in the first half, we probably had around $0.08 per share, if you look at what we had"
77,I'm guessing that it will be about $0.05 or so in the back half
78,"No, not $0.05, probably $0.02 in the back half"
79,"And then, in terms of the components of the tax, I think in addition to the stock comp, we also implemented some other changes geographically that will benefit us in the back half of the year and that's probably roughly a 0.5% point on our tax rate"
80,"And as we laid out with cost transformation, we did say 30 basis points to 50 basis points over the next few years"
81,"In the early years, it will be closer to 30 basis points"
82,"There are some elements like indirect procurement, shared services where we'll get savings earlier"
83,"The areas like the ERP systems and product life cycle management will drive much higher savings in the outer years, but it's a multi-year multi-facetted program"
84,It's working so far and we're getting some early returns at least as it relates to indirect procurement
85,"But the bigger prize will come with product lifecycle management and as you mentioned with ERP, which will begin sort of towards the end of 2018 and continue in the years after that"
