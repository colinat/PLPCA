Ken, thank you, and good morning, everyone
Thanks for joining us today for our Q1 call
We accomplished a lot in the quarter, and we had a great start to the year
We delivered strong financial performance on both the top- and bottom-line
We had a very productive quarter for innovation across our businesses
We continued our strong growth momentum in Asia-Pacific, and we enhanced our customer value proposition with two strategic bolt-on acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our shareholders
Our team executed well to deliver a strong Q1, and we're well positioned to deliver another excellent year
I'll cover each of these highlights in my remarks, starting with our financial results
We delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth in Q1, with a 16% increase to $2.08 per share
Our revenue in Q1 grew 11% year-over-year
Our adjusted operating income increased 16%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points to 22.6%
So we clearly had a great start to the year
Turning now to our performance by end market, in pharma and biotech, we continued to see good growth and our performance in Q1 was in the high-single-digits
The combination of good market fundamentals and the strength of our unique value proposition continues to drive demand from these customers
We had another strong quarter in our bioproduction business, and we also saw strong demand for our biosciences products
Our performance in academic and government end markets in Q1 was similar to what we saw last year and we grew in the low-single-digits
In health care and diagnostics, conditions really haven't changed since last year, and we grew in the low-single-digits in this end market as well
Last, in industrial and applied, we grew at the company average
Applied markets continued to be strong, and we saw good growth in our research and safety market channel with industrial customers
Now let me turn to our growth strategy and touch on some of the great progress we made in Q1 to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future
As you know, our growth strategy is based on three pillars: developing high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets; and delivering our unique customer value proposition
I'll start with innovation, and we got off to a strong start here as well with new products launched across our technology portfolios
Let me highlight a few of them
In Analytical Instruments, the new Thermo Scientific products we showcased at Pittcon really emphasized the success of our R&D strategy in this part of the business, which is essentially twofold
First, we continued to strengthen our leading mass spectrometry and chromotography platforms
And a good example of that was our new iCAP triple-quad mass spec system for clinical research in pharma QA/QC
This is an extension of our successful iCAP product line and combines high-powered analysis with simpler operation
Second, we're using these advanced systems to create specific workflows that are powerful yet easy for our customers to use in applications ranging from pharma compliance to clinical research
The new iCAP system allows customers to switch between single and triple-quad modes so they can keep their existing workflow as well as add new capabilities over time
In our Laboratory Products business, we launched a novel cloud-based application that connects electronic pipettes among individual users in the lab
It's designed to enable centralized programming, storage and sharing of protocols which increases efficiency in what has traditionally been a tedious and inefficient process that's prone to human error
This new product is a great example of how we leverage our deep applications knowledge to help our customers improve efficiency at all stages of their workflows
We were also pleased to learn in the quarter that our TSX Series blood bank refrigerators were recognized by the EPA as the first ENERGY STAR certified lab-grade refrigerators currently available in the market
This demonstrates our commitment to offering customers new technologies that meets their goals for sustainability as well as productivity
In Genetic Sciences, where our strategy is to extend the menu of assays that run on our instruments, we launched the CarrierScan Assay
The new microarray-based solution detects more than 6,000 genomic variations associated with 600 inherited diseases
CarrierScan is the first pan-ethnic research assay, which means it can serve as a single solution for an increasingly diverse population that helps labs greatly accelerate the screening process
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, we had another strong quarter in this region
China led the way again, with growth in the high teens, and we also reported strong growth in India and South Korea
Our strategy of leveraging our unique scale in (sic) [is] (7:43) driving growth across the region
And we continue to build on our industry-leading presence there as well
A quick note on China
I spent time with a number of our customers there a few weeks ago, and I continue to be energized by the long-term prospects for this important end market and the incredible opportunities we have to continue to gain share
The funding environment overall in China continues to be very positive
And we're well-positioned to lead in several areas that are a high priority for the government, such as precision medicine, pharmaceutical production, and environmental monitoring
While I was there, I participated in the opening of a new customer demo laboratory for cryo-electron microscopy at Tsinghua University, one of the world's premier academic institutions
The lab was built by the University to train China's top scientists in the use of these highly sophisticated tools, including our Titan Krios system, the gold standard for structural biology
At the new lab, we're also sponsoring research and educating students through hands-on cryo-EM courses provided by our experts
Understanding the structure of proteins in our blood is a key to advancing precision medicine
And our cryo-EM and Orbitrap platforms are essential to this research
As you recall, cryo-EM is a powerful technology that we added through our acquisition of FEI
One of our key strategic objectives in acquiring FEI is to use our leadership in life sciences to drive adoption of this technology with those customers
Our collaboration with Tsinghua University is a great example of how we're leveraging our leading presence to achieve this goal
I'll make a quick comment on our progress with FEI, now that it's been part of Thermo Fisher for about six months
The integration is going very well
The technologies are fantastic
And we're thrilled to have the FEI team as part of the company
In terms of financial performance, we're running ahead of the year one accretion target that we articulated at the time of the acquisition
This is driven by both the contribution of synergies and the strong growth of the FEI business
Longer term, we're on track to deliver our year three synergy targets
And we look forward to the new growth opportunities we have now that FEI is part of our company
Turning to the last pillar of our growth strategy, our customer value proposition
In the first quarter we completed two bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen our offering in areas with great long-term growth potential for us, bioproduction and digital science
In bioproduction we acquired Finesse Solutions, a leader in the development of scalable measurement and control capabilities
These proprietary universal systems can be integrated seamlessly with our single-use technologies to further optimize the bioproduction workflow
We continue to increase our bioproduction capabilities and capacity to build on our strong momentum in this high-growth market
The other opportunity I want to highlight is the emerging trend towards the digital lab
To add to our capabilities here, we acquired a small but well-respected company called Core Informatics
Core provides a leading cloud-based information management platform that's used in a range of applications from biopharma and genomics to applied markets and manufacturing
This is a scalable platform that complements our existing informatics offering
It's another step in our strategy to develop new digital solutions that support the way our customers want to work, connecting instruments, data, and scientific expertise
Let me give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year
We had a busy Q1 including strategic M&A, stock buybacks, and dividends
And in April, we continued to deploy our capital, buying back an additional $250 million of our shares
So at this point we've deployed just over $1.1 billion of our capital year-to-date
Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising our guidance to reflect our strong Q1 performance, a slightly more favorable FX environment, and the recent acquisitions we completed
Stephen will cover the details
But at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $19.51 billion to $19.71 billion, which would now result in 7% to 8% growth over 2016. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $9.12 to $9.28 for 2017, for 10% to 12% growth over 2016. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our takeaways from Q1. First, we delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom line
We also continued to strengthen our position with strategic investments in innovation, emerging markets, and our customer value proposition
We feel good about our strong start to the year
And we're confident we'll deliver another excellent year in 2017. With that I'm going to hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson
Good morning, Derik
Derik, thanks for the question
At a high-level, when I think about the quarter, obviously a very good start to the year
And the team executed well, serving all of the markets
We came out of the quarter very confident with the 4% organic growth guidance that we outlined back in January
In terms of the color around pharma and biotech, it was a good quarter
It was once again our strongest end market
As I mentioned, it grew in the high single digits
In addition to the strength in bioproduction and biosciences, we also had good strength from chromatography and mass spectrometry
So really a good quarter
As Stephen mentioned in the LPS segment, you saw margin dilution
That was really driven by something we expected in our biopharma services business, which was at the end, in Q4, one of our customers canceled a large Phase III study, a very public one
It had nothing to do with us
The study itself was canceled
And that was a good-sized contract and a profitable piece of business
So it shows up really more in the margin profile within LPS
And we'll sunset that after the third quarter of this year
A single study that was canceled, basically
Well, you don't have to shut up
But from the quarter, academic and government was low single digits, very similar to what we've been seeing in recent quarters; Asia-Pacific being strongest
In terms of the U.S
academic and government, we grew slightly
And we would have expected by this point to be operating with a budget as opposed to under a continuing resolution
So we didn't see really significant change
If you get into the details of the U.S
academic and government, consumables was stronger than instrumentation
But again in aggregate, a low-level of growth in the U.S
Thanks, Derik
Thank you, Tycho
Tycho, thanks for the question
Good chance to just talk about FEI broadly
First, from an integration perspective, going very well
Really a fabulous team and very good complement to our company
In terms of the growth performance, we had a very strong quarter within FEI
And we're expecting to have very strong growth
As you know, because we won't anniversary it until the very end of the third quarter, it's not going to be meaningful contributor to our organic growth
But on a pro forma basis, the business is growing very well
When you look at the pieces of the business, the life sciences portion of the business, which is driven by cryo-EM, is going incredibly strongly and there's excellent interest both in the academic community as well as you're seeing the beginning of interest in the pharmaceutical community as well
We've had some orders put in place, we also had, importantly, those customers kind of sharing some of the academic instruments, doing some studies which shows their interest and, ultimately, we think that they'll become purchasers as well
So that's very strong growth
Material science, which incorporates all of the non-life-sciences, semiconductor, academic, material science, oil and gas, every single thing that's not life sciences within the FEI business had very strong bookings growth in the quarter
Revenue growth was more muted in aggregate, but that will pick up as the year goes on, and that's driven by semiconductor being very strong on the bookings side
So a very encouraging first six months of the integration and we feel very good about the FEI business and how we'll add value to it and how it will add value to Thermo Fisher Scientific
Thanks, Tycho
So as I mentioned in the beginning, industrial and applied grew at about the company average for the quarter
Applied markets were good
Industrial clearly is progressing as we had talked about last quarter
So when you look at the pieces, the shorter cycle portions of the business and the channel reflects that as would some of the lower purchase price, lower aggregate priced instrumentation, had a good quarter in terms of growth and what was also encouraging is that bookings were continuing to grow in the longer cycle products, the things that we mentioned last quarter
So that's two quarters in a row of bookings growth there, and that bodes well for the industrial end markets to play out in line with the expectations that we had articulated back in January, which is growth around the company average, and that would be a nice improvement over what we had seen over the last few years
So that's encouraging
Thanks, Tycho
From a geographic
From a geographic standpoint, Doug, Asia-Pacific, really no significant changes from the guidance back in January
Asia-Pacific, by far the strongest, and both Europe and North America just below the company average would be our expectations
Yeah, you know Doug, it's a good question
The way that we think about it is twofold
First, it is a bit early in the year, and, well, obviously we're encouraged by the good execution in Q1, so it's a bit early to make changes on that
The second thing is one of the assumptions that's embedded in the guidance both in January, in particular was that we would be operating with a U.S
budget and, obviously, that budget that's been talked about is going to have a nice increase for NIH funding
Obviously we're sitting here at the end of April and we're still under continuing resolution
So that's something that we're just paying attention to and, obviously, three days ago, the news was discouraging, this morning the news is encouraging, and we just look forward to actually going from continuing resolution to budget and that can be a positive as the year unfolds
No, when I was in China at the beginning of April, where we're seeing this excellent, excellent activity is very much aligned with the five-year plan
It's not a stimulus-driven thing
It's really around precision medicine
We had a great interaction with a number of thought leaders there, and they're very aligned with what we're doing and obviously in food safety, environmental and the expansion of healthcare
Those were really core parts of the five-year plan in China
So we're not – we hadn't heard much about, if any, about a short-term stimulus effect but rather really alignment with fundamental government priorities
So we think we're very well positioned and, obviously, have a very strong team there
Thanks, Doug
Yeah, Jack, good questions
From the chroma, mass spec area, we continue to drive good growth
We saw strong performance in our high-end mass spectrometers, the Orbitrap family in particular was very strong, chromatography was quite strong across the board, so there wasn't anything that particularly jumped out as something special
Obviously, the applied markets in Asia helped drive some of the growth, but we saw a really widespread adoption across the business
So that perspective we feel good about
In terms of our clinical mass spec, a program that something we're targeting for a launch in 2018 and we're looking forward to it
As we get to some of the upcoming conferences, ASMS, in terms of the research market, you'll see some really exciting launches
And in AACC, you'll get some more views on what we're doing in the clinical space
So this late spring and summer will be super-exciting for Thermo Fisher Scientific as well
Thanks, Jack
Good morning, Steve
Steve, in terms of bioprocess, really a very strong fundamental end market
And we have a very, very strong competitive position
So we've had good growth for a number of years in that business
Q1 was a good quarter for us as well, with high growth as well
As a reminder, we have leadership positions in the media used to grow the product
And then obviously in terms of the single-use technologies that the products are made in, we have market leadership positions
We're excited about the Finesse acquisition, because it complements our single-use technologies
We've been expanding our capacity in terms of our manufacturing plants over the last few years
And we've had a number of openings, both in Grand Island and in Inchinnan in Scotland, where the customer feedback has been incredibly positive
So we feel good about the underlying aspects
There's always some lumpiness in the business, so we don't over-read that too much
I mean, yes, you have a lot of visibility
But sometimes shipments happen in one quarter, move to the next quarter
But for us, we've had pretty smooth growth over the last few years
Yeah, when I look at the three sub-components of Lab Products and Services, you have the channel business, you have our manufacturing business for lab products, which is basically when you walk through a lab, kind of everything you see, the plastics, the equipment, the refrigeration, all of that
And you have our clinical trials logistics, or what we call biopharma services
I actually think all three teams executed very well in the quarter, right? And when I look at the channel business, we had very strong growth in the channel business
Really both in North America and Europe, the business is doing very well
Lab Products had a very strong start to the year in terms of growth
And when I look at the biopharma services business, the activity excluding sort of the one large trial that a customer discontinued, I feel good about the execution there
And then obviously that's going to take a few quarters to sunset
So I don't think there was areas that we under-executed
But we always try to be better, right? And our goal is to continue to drive additional growth, and our teams are focused on that
Thanks, Isaac
In terms of where the momentum is coming from currently, it's really the existing range of products
We have some exciting products in the pipeline
So that will help sustain a very bright outlook for the business
But the momentum you see right now is not really being driven by new products, per se
So that's something that will unfold as the year progresses
I would say that from the industrial, our channel business performed well in both geographies
So we didn't see a big difference versus our expectations there
I would expect pretty balanced improvements in both the U.S
and Europe and encouraging signs in Asia
Thanks
Good
Yeah, so in terms – Bill, thanks for the question
In terms of the microarray business, we're expecting modest organic growth for 2017 for that business, as we said shortly after the acquisition
The first year of ownership, which we sunsetted in March, was softer for that business, primarily about pricing that the competitor had dropped during the sale process of that business
And we launched a number of products and commercial initiatives, and we expect to see some momentum build as we move through the course of 2017.
Thanks, Bill
Yeah
In terms of the outlook for the U.S
, not really
Pretty consistent with the original guidance provided we get a budget at some point in time, right? The continuing resolution is probably a month later going on and we had put into our original guidance we would've thought sometime in early April we would move to a budget, something of that standpoint in our original plan
So if that plays out, then the U.S
should be similar to what we thought
In terms of the science funding, Congress continues to be very focused on strong growth and support for NIH in particular
You can see that in the 21st Century Cures, you can see that in the funding for the Cancer Moonshot
I've had the opportunity to be in D
and meet with a number of members of leadership and there's strong support there from that perspective
So that's – that we're focused on making sure that that continues and feel like that's – it should be okay
No, I thought about that in more detail as we're in the discussion around policy, around the EPA
So obviously the business is primarily driven by activities outside the U.S
in terms of our air monitoring business in particular, primarily in China
In terms of the U.S
, the Federal EPA is a tiny customer directly
So truly, hundreds of thousands of dollars, nothing significant
In terms of – bigger customers are really the states' EPAs that do the monitoring of the air quality and those regulators are typically more stringent than the federal level, so that's encouraging
Longer-term, obviously, a less desire for regulation on EPA is going to be a longer-term headwind for the air quality business
And to frame the magnitude domestically, that business is maybe $50 million, roughly in size
So it's a very small business
Short-term, you don't really see any effect
And with these policies, no new regulations go into effect over the next four years, then obviously that has some longer-term headwinds on that business
Thanks, Dan
We've had broad-based success, Catherine, but clearly precision medicine, the food safety, kind of chromatography and mass spectrometry, genetic sciences, businesses have done very well
There's lots of demand and interest in vaccines and pharmaceutical production
That's been good for both our biosciences business and bioproduction
So it's been pretty broad-based but precision medicine, food safety are probably the two areas that jump out the most to us as big opportunities for continued momentum
Thanks for the question
So let me wrap up the call
First, thank you for joining us
We're very pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year
We feel we're very well positioned to deliver another great year in 2017. And of course, thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific
Thanks, everyone
