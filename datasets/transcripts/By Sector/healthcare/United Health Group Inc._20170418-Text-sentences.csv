46,[audio gap]
47,"we have discussed with you, and we plan to enter 2018 with considerable momentum"
48,Now let me turn it over to Dave
49,Sure
50,"So Kevin, I guess, the way that I would -- let me approach it a couple of different ways"
51,"We have put together, obviously, our plans in terms of how we attack the market for the first five years and weâ€™re in the process as we talked about early that we are developing a second generation plan that weâ€™re going forward with right now"
52,"When we are looking at sales and weâ€™re looking at growth, we look at certain factors as an organization and pretty much everybody in Optum operates off of these factors; number one, would be the backlog that we talked about being about $2.1 billion year-over-year"
53,"We talked about, I guess we didnâ€™t get into what we look at in terms of our sales pipeline that finished 2016 at about $30 billion and that was up from 2015 at about $10 billion"
54,"And then you look at our overall sales in terms of the TCV and that was probably what I just said, the $10 billion to the $30 billion in sales and the overall pipeline would be about $30 billion"
55,So thatâ€™s been tremendous growth in terms of how we look at it
56,"Now, if we look at the first quarter of 2017, I donâ€™t want to go into the numbers"
57,"But I would tell you, itâ€™s a record quarter in terms of overall sales"
58,"Some of the factors that might enter into this, in terms of overall revenue that might make think something that might be a little bit different is that we, as we -- if you just look at Catamaran or you look at what weâ€™re doing in OptumRx"
59,We are absolutely having scale and efficiency thatâ€™s driving a better customer -- totally driving better customer value
60,"And as a result of that, some of those numbers might look a different"
61,And I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about that in a second
62,"But I think that, as we look into 2018, we think that weâ€™re very well positioned"
63,We think that we are on target with all of our expectations
64,"We have the five growth areas that weâ€™re focused on; the government services; what weâ€™re doing in OptumCare; what weâ€™re doing with Pharmacy Care services; technology services, as well as international"
65,"So we feel very, very downhill about 2018."
66,So Tim may be comment a little bit on the OptumRx side
67,"Thatâ€™s a great question, and half a day on"
68,But Dave you want to take that this morning?
69,"I think it comes down to how we spend that capital, and doing it effectively"
70,I donâ€
71,™t think itâ€™s a more capital issue it will give us insight to how we spend it more effectively
72,"We do, and I think Larry alluded to that in terms of revisiting one Optum"
73,And I am going to ask Tim to comment on this
74,But going back to I think what you were talking about the model we had what something called one point time
75,it was 15 by 15 and it was 8 by 16.
76,And what's Steveâ€™s alluding to weâ€
77,™ve played that those two through
78,And now weâ€™re in the process of putting together a new five year business plan that weâ€™re calling the second generation
79,And so there will be an emphasis on a lot of different things
80,But margin will be part of that
81,So I'll ask Tim to comment on that
82,This is Larry
83,"I'll comment on Optum, and what weâ€™re doing in the UK"
84,So it's something that would just relate to in the United States we always talked about 75 market strategy
85,"If you are in the UK, we would talk about a 44 market strategy"
86,And they have developed a mechanism that they call strategic transformation plan
87,And they have linked together their trust and their trust would equal their hospitals
88,And so they have multiple hospitals that are in these SPPs as they call them
89,"So in February, early February, we won our first business first step of a process with one of those SPPs"
90,"And thatâ€™s where you're going to manage with an ACO process, and we do have physician groups"
91,And so weâ€™re tying in everything we do in the states into that win that we just received
92,"Now, itâ€™s a first phase of it, we have about two more that are very, very close to have an a decision on"
93,"And doing that, we strengthen the leadership then weâ€"
94,"™ve moved to a couple of people over so on and in order to manage this the way that weâ€™ll need to manage this, going forward"
95,"I would say that weâ€™re still in a situation, nationally"
96,I look at the -- those 44 SPP is more local markets
97,"But nationally, there are various things going on with data and information and digital that we are actually working with them very, very closely right now as well"
98,I know in the May timeframe weâ€™ll have a showcase where weâ€™ll showcase
99,"all of our technologies, as well as weâ€™ll have the Secretary of Health visiting us here in the States as well as a subset of the NHS board visiting us here in the states in the May timeframe"
100,So things seem to be breaking a lose right now
