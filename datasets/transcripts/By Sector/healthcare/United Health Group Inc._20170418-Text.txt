Thank you, Steve
As you said, it’s the right time to evolve our leadership team
Veteran leaders with new focus, new energies and high expectations working with a mission, from a platform like none other in healthcare
Across UnitedHealth Group, our team continues to deepen the disciplines of responsive service, consistent quality, innovation and relationship trust, all in the context of our mission and our culture
We have meaningfully advanced the net promoter system, NPS, across UnitedHealth Group and fully aligned our compensation systems with annual and long-term NPS goals
This year's first surveys of consumer NPS at UnitedHealthcare showed scores rising 4 points in each of our commercial, Medicare and retirement and community and state businesses
And Optum's results show strong satisfaction as well
The greatest value with this disciplines lies in the insights, NPS provides, enabling our people to design focused action plans to improve the consumer, client and care provider experience
Our enterprise-wide goal is ambitious
We are targeting a world class NPS of 70 within seven years, or 70 in seven
For us, NPS is both an operating and a growth metric, because our operational responses to customer needs increase trust, loyalty retention and reputation and these ultimately translate to growth
And our businesses are experiencing consistently higher customer retention
We are becoming adept in relationship and pipeline development and management, with a laser focus on our five high growth market for the enterprise
Those markets are technology enabled information and services, clinical care delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits and global opportunities
Alone, each one of these areas represents a substantial opportunity to serve
And combined, they drive the next decade of growth for UnitedHealth Group
Turning to Optum's first quarter
We grew earnings from operations by $173 million year-over-year, a 16% earnings growth rate on revenue growth of $1.6 billion, virtually all organic
Operating margins expanded to 6% overall and earnings from operations grew year-over-year by double-digit percentages for each reporting segment
Strong first quarter operating metrics provide visibility into continued revenue growth in 2017. Compared to the first quarter of last year, OptumHealth grew to serve 6 million more people with average per capita revenues growing about 10%
OptumRx fulfilled 15 million more scripts, an above market 5% growth rate
And OptumInsight’s revenue backlog grew 19% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with more than $1.5 billion added in the first quarter
First quarter activity included the completion of our merger with Surgical Care Affiliates, a strategic addition to our OptumCare platform
SCA and its strong leadership team, an outstanding workforce, move us one more step toward creating the next generation of healthcare delivery
Clinical care, i
community focused, high quality, consumer friendly and cost efficient
Today, we serve patients as an in-network care provider on behalf of more than 80 payers
We offer urgent care at nearly 250 neighborhood care centers, primary care through local medical practices in nearly 30 markets with 22,000 dedicated physicians; house calls 1.3 million home visits this year performed by 1,700 skilled certified nurse practitioners; complex care management services, both in home and in nursing facilities; and now, high quality consumer and clinically differentiated surgeries in 33 states and more than 200 convenient free-standing surgical centers with top flight medical partners in local health communities
When we align and integrate enriched patient level data and applied analytics with our own care delivery capabilities, we are better positioned to serve healthcare through more effective value based contracts on a multi-payer basis, and that holds true for those we partner with as well
This effort, when fully scaled, yields more consistent health outcomes, lower cost and greater convenience for patients and the health system as a whole
This will continue to evolve as we advance and connect these practices and patients and integrate their pharmacy and other ambulatory and acute services
We are just in the beginning phases of this multi-year effort
OptumRx was selected last month as a pharmacy care partnered by the Health Transformation Alliance, which represents Fortune 100 national employers
Proven OptimaRx capabilities in applying data and analytics to improve both pharmacy care and health care were important to earning new opportunity
We see the potential for multi-year growth through HTA, following a notable business award implemented in 2017 from several of the largest, most sophisticated customers in the market
Our health financial services capabilities continue to drive growth across channels, products and platforms as well
The nation's second largest retirement plan administrator, Empower Retirement, named OptumHealth its exclusive partner for health savings accounts
Empower Health’s people understand the direct connection between health and wealth, and is offering customers Optum’s HSA’s and digital tools to help retirees and active workers plan and save their future healthcare expenses
These examples further illustrate how we serve effectively and strategically interconnected businesses with platform level capabilities
It has been over five years since we began one Optum, an effort that built a robust and growing first generation information and technology enabled health services platform
Many of you have tracked Optum success in bringing a differentiated approach to helping customers better solve their complex problems
This year, our revenues are on pace to triple from 2011, and we are continuing efforts to align and integrate our businesses to position leadership, to build deeper relationships, and to focus on mission, culture and growth
Today, we are driving a second generations one Optum effort, to position Optum to truly enable a better performing healthcare system from the local community to national and global levels
Our first quarter demonstrates we are on track to achieve the strong level of results in 2017 [audio gap] we have discussed with you, and we plan to enter 2018 with considerable momentum
Now let me turn it over to Dave
Sure
So Kevin, I guess, the way that I would -- let me approach it a couple of different ways
We have put together, obviously, our plans in terms of how we attack the market for the first five years and we’re in the process as we talked about early that we are developing a second generation plan that we’re going forward with right now
When we are looking at sales and we’re looking at growth, we look at certain factors as an organization and pretty much everybody in Optum operates off of these factors; number one, would be the backlog that we talked about being about $2.1 billion year-over-year
We talked about, I guess we didn’t get into what we look at in terms of our sales pipeline that finished 2016 at about $30 billion and that was up from 2015 at about $10 billion
And then you look at our overall sales in terms of the TCV and that was probably what I just said, the $10 billion to the $30 billion in sales and the overall pipeline would be about $30 billion
So that’s been tremendous growth in terms of how we look at it
Now, if we look at the first quarter of 2017, I don’t want to go into the numbers
But I would tell you, it’s a record quarter in terms of overall sales
Some of the factors that might enter into this, in terms of overall revenue that might make think something that might be a little bit different is that we, as we -- if you just look at Catamaran or you look at what we’re doing in OptumRx
We are absolutely having scale and efficiency that’s driving a better customer -- totally driving better customer value
And as a result of that, some of those numbers might look a different
And I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about that in a second
But I think that, as we look into 2018, we think that we’re very well positioned
We think that we are on target with all of our expectations
We have the five growth areas that we’re focused on; the government services; what we’re doing in OptumCare; what we’re doing with Pharmacy Care services; technology services, as well as international
So we feel very, very downhill about 2018. So Tim may be comment a little bit on the OptumRx side
That’s a great question, and half a day on
But Dave you want to take that this morning?
I think it comes down to how we spend that capital, and doing it effectively
I don’t think it’s a more capital issue it will give us insight to how we spend it more effectively
We do, and I think Larry alluded to that in terms of revisiting one Optum
And I am going to ask Tim to comment on this
But going back to I think what you were talking about the model we had what something called one point time it was 15 by 15 and it was 8 by 16. And what's Steve’s alluding to we’ve played that those two through
And now we’re in the process of putting together a new five year business plan that we’re calling the second generation
And so there will be an emphasis on a lot of different things
But margin will be part of that
So I'll ask Tim to comment on that
This is Larry
I'll comment on Optum, and what we’re doing in the UK
So it's something that would just relate to in the United States we always talked about 75 market strategy
If you are in the UK, we would talk about a 44 market strategy
And they have developed a mechanism that they call strategic transformation plan
And they have linked together their trust and their trust would equal their hospitals
And so they have multiple hospitals that are in these SPPs as they call them
So in February, early February, we won our first business first step of a process with one of those SPPs
And that’s where you're going to manage with an ACO process, and we do have physician groups
And so we’re tying in everything we do in the states into that win that we just received
Now, it’s a first phase of it, we have about two more that are very, very close to have an a decision on
And doing that, we strengthen the leadership then we’ve moved to a couple of people over so on and in order to manage this the way that we’ll need to manage this, going forward
I would say that we’re still in a situation, nationally
I look at the -- those 44 SPP is more local markets
But nationally, there are various things going on with data and information and digital that we are actually working with them very, very closely right now as well
I know in the May timeframe we’ll have a showcase where we’ll showcase all of our technologies, as well as we’ll have the Secretary of Health visiting us here in the States as well as a subset of the NHS board visiting us here in the states in the May timeframe
So things seem to be breaking a lose right now
