0,Thanks Dow and hello everyone
1,"I have framed my comments today in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity"
2,So let me start with growth
3,"Companywide revenue was $739 million in the fourth quarter, down 1% in dollars and down 2% in constant currency"
4,"For the full year, revenue of $2.7 billion was up 2% in both dollars and in constant currency"
5,"We ended the year with $3.5 billion in backlog, up 10%"
6,"For the fourth quarter, oncology revenue was $686 million, up 1% in both dollars and in constant currency"
7,"Orders were $964 million, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency"
8,Taking a closer look at our oncology business results
9,"In the Americas, fourth quarter revenue grew 2% in dollars and in constant currency"
10,"Orders were $489 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency"
11,"North America orders grew 8% supported by key wins in the quarter including Barnes-Jewish Healthcare, which ordered one Halcyon system, four TrueBeams and software packages for five centers in their network"
12,"We continue to see strong multisystem orders from a variety of healthcare customers such as Spectrum Health, MultiCare, Trinity and Western Connecticut"
13,A slight correction to Dow's opening comments
14,"We had overall 10 Halcyon orders in North America during the quarter, not in North Africa"
15,"In Latin America, orders were down 46% due to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals"
16,However Brazil had solid performance highlighted by $9 million order with [indiscernible] and a $6 million order with the Clinic of Oncology and Radiotherapy of [indiscernible]
17,Asia-Pacific revenue declined 5% in dollars and 4% in constant currency
18,"Orders were $155 million, declining 10% in dollars and 9% in constant currency"
19,Orders declined double digits in the Japan market primarily due to continued market softness which was offset by solid double digit growth in other countries
20,Our first Halcyon system in Korea was ordered by a non-hospital
21,"In Australia, we received a treatment planning system order from Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne worth $16 million over 10 years"
22,"Lastly in the region, in China we maintained our market leadership position with robust double digit growth"
23,"In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenue grew 3% and was flat in constant currency"
24,Orders grew 32% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to $321 million in the fourth quarter
25,Growth was balanced across mature and emerging markets in the region
26,"In Western Europe, an $18 million order at a network of clinics in France supported this 45% growth in the quarter"
27,"In India, strong double digit orders growth in the quarter was supported by a $15 million order from West Bengal for three TrueBeam and two VitalBeam systems"
28,"Across the geography, we booked 12 Halcyon orders in the quarter"
29,Turning to full year results
30,Oncology revenue of $2.5 billion was up 1% in dollars and in constant currency
31,"Orders were $2.9 billion, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency"
32,And backlog grew 9% over the year ending at $3.2 billion
33,"By geography, Americas orders grew 3% for the full year, driven by strong North America performance of 6%"
34,"APAC orders grew 7% and Europe orders grew 14% overall, increasing its geographical mix to 30%, up two points from last year"
35,"Overall, we are pleased with our full year performance and strength in our oncology business, as evidenced by our LinAcc installed base growing 4% for the full year with a strong distribution of new units installed across all three geographies"
36,"Our proton therapy business posted revenues of $52 million in the fourth quarter, down 23% from a year ago but in line with company expectations"
37,"We booked two orders during the quarter, bringing the total number of orders for the year to six, half of which were in international markets"
38,"For the full year, revenue was $182 million, up 12%"
39,"We ended the year with $323 million in backlog, up 18% year-on-year"
40,Turning to profitability
41,Total company fourth quarter gross margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 42.3%
42,This included a $2 million or 30 basis point unfavorable adjustment to estimated project costs in our proton business
43,"However for the full year, gross margin rate increased 87 basis points to 43.5%"
44,"Oncology fourth quarter gross margin increased $1.6 million, but the rate decreased 26 basis points to 45%"
45,"Strong services revenue mix within the quarter was offset by lower product gross margin rate in the quarter, primarily due to country and product mix"
46,It is worth noting that at a country level average selling prices held relatively steady
47,"Also, within the quarter, we recorded a $3 million customs duty related charge in Brazil"
48,"Full year oncology gross margin increased 161 basis points to 46%, primarily driven by increased service mix and realization of ongoing efforts to optimize the supply chain"
49,Looking at proton therapy
50,"Fourth quarter gross margin dollars were down $9 million, including the impact of the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs"
51,Full year gross margin dollars were down 36%
52,"Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $131 million, up $11 million or 9% and 18% of revenue"
53,This included a $5 million bad debt expense
54,A quick reminder that the fourth quarter of 2016 included a favorable $4 million bad debt release
55,"And since the first quarter of this year, we have consistently reduced SG&A costs as a percent of revenue but there is more work to do"
56,"On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter depreciation and amortization was $18 million and full year was $77 million"
57,Investment will continue to be a driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy
58,"In the quarter, we invested $52 million in R&D or 7% of revenue"
59,"R&D expenses for the full year were $210 million, up 5% and representing 5% of revenue"
60,"Fourth quarter operating earnings results were $131 million or 18% of revenue, declining 11%"
61,"The decline is primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5 million, Brazil customs duty related charges of $3 million, the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs in the proton business and lower proton business gross margin"
62,EPS in the quarter was $1.09 and our diluted share count in the quarter was 92.6 million shares
63,"For the full year, operating earnings of $437 million or 16.4% of revenue declined 8%"
64,Our effective tax rate was 23.6% and EPS was $3.60.
65,These results include the fourth quarter items I mentioned previously and the impact from the first quarter of $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton therapy business
66,"On a GAAP basis, Varian took a $13 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the California Proton Treatment Center or CPTC in San Diego because of a decrease in expected operating cash flows and an increase in incremental financing needs arising out of the transition of the center from Scripps to a white label regional center, which was an agreement executed in September"
67,"During the quarter, we performed a review of this new agreement, including expected EBITDA amounts, timing of the expected municipal bond financing and the amount of new senior debt required"
68,"In comparing that to the analysis performed in the first quarter of 2017, it was determined that the present value of cash flows expected to be collected by Varian was less than the carrying value of the CPTC loan balances"
69,Thus we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter
70,Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity
71,We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $716 million and debt of $350 million
72,Cash flow from operations was $130 million in the fourth quarter and $399 million for the full year
73,We are pleased to see continued improvement in DSO for our oncology business which was down one day from the prior quarter and down six days from our second quarter
74,We will continue to focus on operational discipline and the cash conversion cycle
75,"In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $18.7 million in CapEx and $25 million to repurchase 250,000 shares of our stock"
76,"As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 5.25 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization"
77,Now let's talk about FY 2018.
78,"As Dow mentioned, we have a long-term growth and increase strategy supported by initiatives to strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy, extend our global footprint and expand into new addressable markets"
79,"We continue to invest in high quality, innovation and building new capabilities in software services and big data while driving operational efficiency and disciplined capital management"
80,We will track key performance indicators to evaluate results but always in the context of progress towards our long-term value creation objectives
81,"Therefore we are deploying a framework across the business to drive a culture of ownership in evaluating operational trade-offs, capital allocation and investment decisions"
82,We will also incorporate this into our incentive design to achieve the desired outcomes over the long-term
83,"Given the duration our sales, research and development and product cycles, we believe that a trailing four quarter view is a better indicator of our progress toward achieving our long-term strategy"
84,Thus we are moving to annual guidance for fiscal 2018 and are aligning our financial practices accordingly
85,"As Dow said earlier, for fiscal 2018 we expect revenue growth from 2% to 4% and net earnings per diluted share from $4.20 to $4.32."
86,"Going forward, we will also provide full year guidance on operating earnings, cash flow from operations, tax rate and share count"
87,"For fiscal year 2018, we see the following for these items"
88,"Operating earnings between 18% to 19% of revenue, cash flow from operations between $475 million and $550 million and a 23% tax rate for the year and no change to share count year-over-year"
89,And now let's go to the operator for Q&A
90,Question-and-Answer Session
91,"Look Jeff, we are coming out of a transitional year as well and the spin of Varex, new product launches with Halcyon and HyperArc,"
92,our new brand
93,We are going to continue to watch our conversion metrics as we go through the year
94,"But like Dow said, this is a pragmatic approach to revenue guidance at 2% to 4% for the year"
95,Just to build on that a little bit
96,and I will answer your currency question just thereafter
97,"The market we just came out of for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, market growth was 2.1%"
98,And so we just guided to 2% to 4%
99,And then our orders growth over that same period of time is 3.4%
100,So again we feel like that guiding in 2% to 4% is a pragmatic approach to that number
101,And then to answer on the currency side is no
102,We assume no currency impact next year
103,"Thanks for the question, Amit"
104,"From the overall revenue guidance perspective, we did make the revenue guidance in the quarter and felt good about the momentum exiting the quarter here in the second-half from an orders growth perspective"
105,And so again we think 2% to 4% of revenue guidance is pragmatic
106,From an earnings per share perspective
107,"I think the way to think about it is, as you look back on all of 2017 and you look back into the fourth quarter, there are things that impacted the business that was a result of good operational rigor that will continue"
108,"Those things in the fourth quarter would include the bad debt expense, it would include the Brazil's customs duty related expense and the adjustment of estimated proton business project costs"
109,"That's about $10 million there in cost that, again, good operational rigor that drove us to incur those cost in the period"
110,"But as we work our way through the operational rigor, I am sure we will continue to improve from a results perspective as we move forward"
111,So $4.20 to $4.34 from an earnings per share guidance perspective feels about right given the operational excellence that I have seen in the business here in the last five or six months that I have been at Varian
112,Sure
113,"So as it relates to the operating earnings margin rates, look, we are looking for targeting and driving sustainable improvement in our supply chain and operating expenses"
114,"This range that we gave would infer 50 to maybe 70 or even 100 basis points to the top end of the range of operating margin improvement in FY 2018 over FY 2017, when you take a look at things on a apples-to-apples basis"
115,We are still trying to achieve that 18% to 22% aspirational target that we have got in front of us
116,And we also want to be cognizant of the fact that we want to ensure the ability to invest in growth options organically that we see in front of us
117,So that's the nature of the guidance from an 18% to 19% perspective on operating earnings
118,"As it relates to share repurchase, there will be share repurchase"
119,"just like there was in the fourth quarter,"
120,right
121,"We did $25 million to retire 250,000 shares"
122,What I said in my guidance is that share count would be flat year-over-year
123,"So there will be due to restricted shares and stock option exercises, there will be shares that come into the share count and we will endeavor to keep that flat year-over-year with our share repurchase activity in FY 2018."
124,"And again, the overall objective here from how we deploy capital is, one organically"
125,"like I just said, two is look at inorganic options"
126,We feel like we have good financial flexibility relative to our capitalizing on inorganic activities that are in front of us
127,"And then third and only thereafter, we would execute on the share repurchase side"
128,Sure
129,"So just so we are on the same page, we grew 2% in oncology for the full year, right"
130,And we see now
131,and we are guiding now
132,", I am sorry, 1% year-on-year in oncology"
133,and so we are guiding now %2 to 4% overall for 2018.
134,So we don't see it as a deceleration in the growth rate
135,We kind of see it at or better than what we did here in 2017.
136,"Again, we will continue to keep a close eye on conversion rates and the opportunities we see in front of us"
137,But we feel that that's pragmatic growth given the orders growth rate we have seen historically over the last 12 to 18 months
138,I will certainly to cash flow from operations
139,And the way to think about that guidance is that the revenue and EBIT targets that we gave plus we are looking for our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle and our ability to operationally execute through improvements there
140,Those two combine
141,So working capital benefit along with the EBIT dollars trends you right into that range for FY 2018.
142,"As far as free cash flow, I am not going to comment on free cash flow today and get into CapEx and other elements of capital allocation process that we have got ahead of us"
143,"But from a cash flow from operations perspective, we feel good about that guidance that we have out there"
