Thanks Dow and hello everyone
I have framed my comments today in the context of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, which includes balancing growth, profitability and liquidity
So let me start with growth
Companywide revenue was $739 million in the fourth quarter, down 1% in dollars and down 2% in constant currency
For the full year, revenue of $2.7 billion was up 2% in both dollars and in constant currency
We ended the year with $3.5 billion in backlog, up 10%
For the fourth quarter, oncology revenue was $686 million, up 1% in both dollars and in constant currency
Orders were $964 million, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency
Taking a closer look at our oncology business results
In the Americas, fourth quarter revenue grew 2% in dollars and in constant currency
Orders were $489 million, up 1% in dollars and 2% in constant currency
North America orders grew 8% supported by key wins in the quarter including Barnes-Jewish Healthcare, which ordered one Halcyon system, four TrueBeams and software packages for five centers in their network
We continue to see strong multisystem orders from a variety of healthcare customers such as Spectrum Health, MultiCare, Trinity and Western Connecticut
A slight correction to Dow's opening comments
We had overall 10 Halcyon orders in North America during the quarter, not in North Africa
In Latin America, orders were down 46% due to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals
However Brazil had solid performance highlighted by $9 million order with [indiscernible] and a $6 million order with the Clinic of Oncology and Radiotherapy of [indiscernible]
Asia-Pacific revenue declined 5% in dollars and 4% in constant currency
Orders were $155 million, declining 10% in dollars and 9% in constant currency
Orders declined double digits in the Japan market primarily due to continued market softness which was offset by solid double digit growth in other countries
Our first Halcyon system in Korea was ordered by a non-hospital
In Australia, we received a treatment planning system order from Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne worth $16 million over 10 years
Lastly in the region, in China we maintained our market leadership position with robust double digit growth
In our Europe, Middle East, India and Africa geography, revenue grew 3% and was flat in constant currency
Orders grew 32% in dollars and 29% in constant currency to $321 million in the fourth quarter
Growth was balanced across mature and emerging markets in the region
In Western Europe, an $18 million order at a network of clinics in France supported this 45% growth in the quarter
In India, strong double digit orders growth in the quarter was supported by a $15 million order from West Bengal for three TrueBeam and two VitalBeam systems
Across the geography, we booked 12 Halcyon orders in the quarter
Turning to full year results
Oncology revenue of $2.5 billion was up 1% in dollars and in constant currency
Orders were $2.9 billion, up 7% in dollars and in constant currency
And backlog grew 9% over the year ending at $3.2 billion
By geography, Americas orders grew 3% for the full year, driven by strong North America performance of 6%
APAC orders grew 7% and Europe orders grew 14% overall, increasing its geographical mix to 30%, up two points from last year
Overall, we are pleased with our full year performance and strength in our oncology business, as evidenced by our LinAcc installed base growing 4% for the full year with a strong distribution of new units installed across all three geographies
Our proton therapy business posted revenues of $52 million in the fourth quarter, down 23% from a year ago but in line with company expectations
We booked two orders during the quarter, bringing the total number of orders for the year to six, half of which were in international markets
For the full year, revenue was $182 million, up 12%
We ended the year with $323 million in backlog, up 18% year-on-year
Turning to profitability
Total company fourth quarter gross margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 42.3%
This included a $2 million or 30 basis point unfavorable adjustment to estimated project costs in our proton business
However for the full year, gross margin rate increased 87 basis points to 43.5%
Oncology fourth quarter gross margin increased $1.6 million, but the rate decreased 26 basis points to 45%
Strong services revenue mix within the quarter was offset by lower product gross margin rate in the quarter, primarily due to country and product mix
It is worth noting that at a country level average selling prices held relatively steady
Also, within the quarter, we recorded a $3 million customs duty related charge in Brazil
Full year oncology gross margin increased 161 basis points to 46%, primarily driven by increased service mix and realization of ongoing efforts to optimize the supply chain
Looking at proton therapy
Fourth quarter gross margin dollars were down $9 million, including the impact of the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs
Full year gross margin dollars were down 36%
Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $131 million, up $11 million or 9% and 18% of revenue
This included a $5 million bad debt expense
A quick reminder that the fourth quarter of 2016 included a favorable $4 million bad debt release
And since the first quarter of this year, we have consistently reduced SG&A costs as a percent of revenue but there is more work to do
On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter depreciation and amortization was $18 million and full year was $77 million
Investment will continue to be a driver of our long-term growth and value creation strategy
In the quarter, we invested $52 million in R&D or 7% of revenue
R&D expenses for the full year were $210 million, up 5% and representing 5% of revenue
Fourth quarter operating earnings results were $131 million or 18% of revenue, declining 11%
The decline is primarily driven by bad debt expense of $5 million, Brazil customs duty related charges of $3 million, the $2 million adjustment to estimated project costs in the proton business and lower proton business gross margin
EPS in the quarter was $1.09 and our diluted share count in the quarter was 92.6 million shares
For the full year, operating earnings of $437 million or 16.4% of revenue declined 8%
Our effective tax rate was 23.6% and EPS was $3.60. These results include the fourth quarter items I mentioned previously and the impact from the first quarter of $38 million accounts receivable reserve related to the proton therapy business
On a GAAP basis, Varian took a $13 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the California Proton Treatment Center or CPTC in San Diego because of a decrease in expected operating cash flows and an increase in incremental financing needs arising out of the transition of the center from Scripps to a white label regional center, which was an agreement executed in September
During the quarter, we performed a review of this new agreement, including expected EBITDA amounts, timing of the expected municipal bond financing and the amount of new senior debt required
In comparing that to the analysis performed in the first quarter of 2017, it was determined that the present value of cash flows expected to be collected by Varian was less than the carrying value of the CPTC loan balances
Thus we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter
Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $716 million and debt of $350 million
Cash flow from operations was $130 million in the fourth quarter and $399 million for the full year
We are pleased to see continued improvement in DSO for our oncology business which was down one day from the prior quarter and down six days from our second quarter
We will continue to focus on operational discipline and the cash conversion cycle
In addition to R&D, other investments in the quarter included $18.7 million in CapEx and $25 million to repurchase 250,000 shares of our stock
As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 5.25 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization
Now let's talk about FY 2018. As Dow mentioned, we have a long-term growth and increase strategy supported by initiatives to strengthen our leadership in radiation therapy, extend our global footprint and expand into new addressable markets
We continue to invest in high quality, innovation and building new capabilities in software services and big data while driving operational efficiency and disciplined capital management
We will track key performance indicators to evaluate results but always in the context of progress towards our long-term value creation objectives
Therefore we are deploying a framework across the business to drive a culture of ownership in evaluating operational trade-offs, capital allocation and investment decisions
We will also incorporate this into our incentive design to achieve the desired outcomes over the long-term
Given the duration our sales, research and development and product cycles, we believe that a trailing four quarter view is a better indicator of our progress toward achieving our long-term strategy
Thus we are moving to annual guidance for fiscal 2018 and are aligning our financial practices accordingly
As Dow said earlier, for fiscal 2018 we expect revenue growth from 2% to 4% and net earnings per diluted share from $4.20 to $4.32. Going forward, we will also provide full year guidance on operating earnings, cash flow from operations, tax rate and share count
For fiscal year 2018, we see the following for these items
Operating earnings between 18% to 19% of revenue, cash flow from operations between $475 million and $550 million and a 23% tax rate for the year and no change to share count year-over-year
And now let's go to the operator for Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
Look Jeff, we are coming out of a transitional year as well and the spin of Varex, new product launches with Halcyon and HyperArc, our new brand
We are going to continue to watch our conversion metrics as we go through the year
But like Dow said, this is a pragmatic approach to revenue guidance at 2% to 4% for the year
Just to build on that a little bit and I will answer your currency question just thereafter
The market we just came out of for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, market growth was 2.1%
And so we just guided to 2% to 4%
And then our orders growth over that same period of time is 3.4%
So again we feel like that guiding in 2% to 4% is a pragmatic approach to that number
And then to answer on the currency side is no
We assume no currency impact next year
Thanks for the question, Amit
From the overall revenue guidance perspective, we did make the revenue guidance in the quarter and felt good about the momentum exiting the quarter here in the second-half from an orders growth perspective
And so again we think 2% to 4% of revenue guidance is pragmatic
From an earnings per share perspective
I think the way to think about it is, as you look back on all of 2017 and you look back into the fourth quarter, there are things that impacted the business that was a result of good operational rigor that will continue
Those things in the fourth quarter would include the bad debt expense, it would include the Brazil's customs duty related expense and the adjustment of estimated proton business project costs
That's about $10 million there in cost that, again, good operational rigor that drove us to incur those cost in the period
But as we work our way through the operational rigor, I am sure we will continue to improve from a results perspective as we move forward
So $4.20 to $4.34 from an earnings per share guidance perspective feels about right given the operational excellence that I have seen in the business here in the last five or six months that I have been at Varian
Sure
So as it relates to the operating earnings margin rates, look, we are looking for targeting and driving sustainable improvement in our supply chain and operating expenses
This range that we gave would infer 50 to maybe 70 or even 100 basis points to the top end of the range of operating margin improvement in FY 2018 over FY 2017, when you take a look at things on a apples-to-apples basis
We are still trying to achieve that 18% to 22% aspirational target that we have got in front of us
And we also want to be cognizant of the fact that we want to ensure the ability to invest in growth options organically that we see in front of us
So that's the nature of the guidance from an 18% to 19% perspective on operating earnings
As it relates to share repurchase, there will be share repurchase just like there was in the fourth quarter, right
We did $25 million to retire 250,000 shares
What I said in my guidance is that share count would be flat year-over-year
So there will be due to restricted shares and stock option exercises, there will be shares that come into the share count and we will endeavor to keep that flat year-over-year with our share repurchase activity in FY 2018. And again, the overall objective here from how we deploy capital is, one organically like I just said, two is look at inorganic options
We feel like we have good financial flexibility relative to our capitalizing on inorganic activities that are in front of us
And then third and only thereafter, we would execute on the share repurchase side
Sure
So just so we are on the same page, we grew 2% in oncology for the full year, right
And we see now and we are guiding now, I am sorry, 1% year-on-year in oncology and so we are guiding now %2 to 4% overall for 2018. So we don't see it as a deceleration in the growth rate
We kind of see it at or better than what we did here in 2017. Again, we will continue to keep a close eye on conversion rates and the opportunities we see in front of us
But we feel that that's pragmatic growth given the orders growth rate we have seen historically over the last 12 to 18 months
I will certainly to cash flow from operations
And the way to think about that guidance is that the revenue and EBIT targets that we gave plus we are looking for our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle and our ability to operationally execute through improvements there
Those two combine
So working capital benefit along with the EBIT dollars trends you right into that range for FY 2018. As far as free cash flow, I am not going to comment on free cash flow today and get into CapEx and other elements of capital allocation process that we have got ahead of us
But from a cash flow from operations perspective, we feel good about that guidance that we have out there
