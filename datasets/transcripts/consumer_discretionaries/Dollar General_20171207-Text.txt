Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone
As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our third quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit
Gross profit for the 2017 quarter was $1.8 billion or 29.9% of sales, an improvement of eight basis points from last year's third quarter
As compared to the prior year third quarter, the gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory mark-ups and lower inventory shrink, partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumable sales, and increased transportation costs
SG&A expense increased by 40 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.3 billion or 22.9% of sales in the third quarter
This quarter's SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, given our previously planned investments in store manager compensation, and increased incentive compensation and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales
The increased occupancy costs were primarily attributable to a record number of 470 new store openings in the quarter, over half of which were related to acquired stores and which represents an 82% increase in openings over the prior year third quarter
We also recorded $24.8 million of incremental expenses related to the impact of the hurricanes, which occurred during the quarter as Todd discussed earlier
Partially offsetting these increased expenses were lower utilities costs and a reduction in advertising costs
Please keep in mind, in the 2016 third quarter we incurred charges of $13 million associated with store sites acquired from a large box retailer and the related closure of existing stores plus an estimated $7.7 million of incremental disaster-related expenses
In the press release issued this morning, we have provided tables detailing the estimated impact of the 2017 hurricanes on our third quarter results
Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.8%, as compared to 36.2% in the third quarter last year
The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2017 third quarter, due primarily to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit this quarter, as compared to the prior year quarter
Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement merchandise inventories at third quarter end were $3.6 billion
For the quarter, total inventory increased 3.1%, while declining 4.9% on a per store basis
This marks our second consecutive quarter of inventory decline on a per store basis
We believe our inventory is in great shape, and are comfortable with the quality
Our longer term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.14 billion an $18 million increase compared to the same period last year
This year's increase was primarily due to an improvement in our same-store inventory levels partially offset by increased income tax payments as a result of timing of income recognition for tax purposes
It is also important to note that we're lapping significant working capital improvements from 2016. We continue to be pleased with our solid cash flow generation
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock for $135 million, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 from the common share outstanding at a total cost of $71 million
Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $512 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend
From December 2011 [ph] through the third quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.9 billion or 78.4 million shares of our common stock
We have remaining authorization of approximately $635 million under the repurchase program
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders
Our first priority remains investing in new stores where we continue to see great returns and the necessary infrastructure to support our store growth, our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases
Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment grade rating by managing to leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA
Looking ahead, please keep a couple of points in mind, recall our fiscal 2017 is a 52 week year versus the 2016 53 week year, we estimated that the 53rd week in 2016 contribute about $0.09 per share to earnings that will not recur this year
As Todd mentioned, we are pleased with our performance at this point in the year
We are narrowing our forecast for GAAP diluted EPS to range of $4.37 to $4.47 compared to our previous guidance range of $4.35 to $4.50. Given that our guidance is on a reported GAAP basis
We are absorbing the $0.05 per diluted share for the net negative impact associated with the hurricane
However we are only reducing the high-end of our guidance range by $0.03. For the fiscal year, this guidance includes the debt extinguishment charge of $0.01 per share recorded in the first quarter and absorbed two items that were not contemplated when either we provided our initial fiscal 2017 EPS guidance or our most recent update
Number one the $0.02 per share charge reported in the second quarter primarily for lease termination cost and number two the estimated $0.05 per share net negative impact of the hurricanes during the quarter
Our guidance does not contemplate any potential impact from U.S
Corporate Tax Legislation Reform
We are raising our 217 same store sales growth forecast to approximately 2.5% and updating our 2017 net sales growth forecast to approximately 7% which is at the high end of our prior outlook of 5% to 7% growth
We are also updating our 2017 capital expenditures forecast to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as compared to our private previous guidance of $750 million to $765 million
Share repurchases for the fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted at approximately $450 million
We have been very disciplined and how we manage expenses in capital with the gold to deliver consistent, strong financial performance while positioning our business for a long term growth and we planned to continue with this strategy in the future
We are investing in initiatives and tended to drive same store sales and the loyalty across our consumer base with the value and convenience that our customers need and trust from us
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd
Yes, adding little more color to that, as you alluded to while SG&A was up 40 basis points, the hurricane impact of nearly $25 million was 42 basis points
While we did have some headwinds last year, I think it's important to note that there is two key headwinds this quarter with the ongoing impact of the store manager investment which again we continue to see as a great investment that will pay off for us
As we get into next year, it will no longer be a headwind
And then the other key point is the ramp up of acquired stores
Again as we mentioned, we opened a record number of stores this quarter, up 82% over the previous year
Over half -- this 470 stores, over half of those were new stores
Many of which had expenses throughout the quarter as we were opening those up
So those put pressures on that
When you strip that out, we are still in the place we want to be from a leverage standpoint
And as Todd said that with zero based budgeting that's really becoming [grand] [ph] in everything we do here
And I can assure you, the team is laser-focused on driving out any and all spending that don't touch our customer, support our strategic initiatives, or change our risk profile
So, we continue to be very focused on that as well as gross margin, making the right tradeoffs there while investing in the business and still see ourselves in that same leverage point that we targeted
Yes, if you look at the cadence across the periods in the third quarter, every period was positive
But September was the most positive of the quarterâ€™s period [Indiscernible]
I think it's also worth that noting the balance between both consumables and non-consumables being positive overall
And then, on the gross margin, can you give us a sense what that number would have been excluding the acquired stores?
It was a couple basis points at most
Thanks guys, appreciate it
Our new store program is hitting on all cylinders right now
We continue to see same strong business fundamentals and feel great about the business top line, bottom line
If you look at EPS based on year-to-date performance, we did narrow the guidance on that raising the bottom end of it $0.02. We only lowered the top end of that $0.03 after taking into account the $0.05 net negative impact from the hurricanes
If you strip out the hurricane impact, we really see as a raise on both the top end and the bottom end
And recall, we had indicated previously that Q3 would be the strongest quarter of the year with Q4 having a more difficult lap and included in that overlap and estimated $0.09 benefit last year from the 53rd week
So we continue to see things in a similar light
Again, we will have to wait and see exactly how that comes up
What I would say is as we see it now, we see ourselves continuing to operate, run the business same way we have this worked quite well obviously evaluating situations as we go, but feel pretty happy about the way we are managing all the levers now
Yes, I would tell you that as far as the competitive environment, it's always competitive to retail, but as you look at it, we really haven't seen a change in the competitor environment in the last few quarters
So we're - it's about where it was
And the great thing is that Dollar General is positioned very well price-wise both every day price and the promotional activity that we have to offer for the consumer
And the other thing that we offer her is a great compelling offering on our digital side
More and more digital engagement is starting to happen here at Dollar General with our core consumer
And if that continues to resonate with our core, you'll continue to see more of that, and I believe that overall our core customer is responding pretty well to all of the initiatives that we put together here in 2017. And again, that's what gives us a great solace as we move into 2018 that we can continue to keep that momentum moving
