Thanks, Gerald
I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Hanesbrands
It truly is a world class organization with great brands and an unmatched culture
I'm honored to have had a hand in our successful strategies over the past 12 years from Innovate-to-Elevate to our acquisition and capital allocation strategy to Project Booster
These strategies have driven significant returns for our shareholders over the past decade through a variety of different end market environments
More importantly, they've remade Hanesbrands to be successful for the next decade, irrespective of the current challenges in the U.S
We're investing in areas of growth which has resulted in a much more diversified revenue base with over 30% of our sales now outside the U.S
, roughly 40% of our sales coming from Activewear products and nearly 20% of our sales coming from online and our own retail operations
Combine our revenue diversification with visible profit and cash flow drivers, such as our remaining acquisition synergies, and Project Booster savings, and we're confident in our ability to further expand our margins and to deliver on our cash flow goal of an annual run rate of $1 billion as we exit 2019. Now let me speak to our performance during the quarter
Sales increased more than 2% over last year, driven by organic growth in the base business and roughly $15 million from acquisition contributions
As expected, gross margin improved over last year, increasing 20 basis points to 37.8%, driven by efficiency gains within our supply chain
Operating margin of 15% declined 40 basis points versus last year due primarily to a higher mix of international sales
Recall, international margins are expected to be temporarily lower as we have yet to recognize full synergies from prior acquisitions
By business, our margins remain strong, and this was evident in the year-over-year expansion in all of our segment margins in the quarter
The tax rate was 2% as a result of higher profit in lower tax jurisdictions and our normal third quarter discrete items related to adjustments of prior year tax returns
And earnings per share of $0.60 was at the midpoint of our guidance range and included a $0.01 per share drag from the impact of hurricanes in the U.S
and the earthquake in Mexico
Looking at our domestic segments, as Gerald highlighted, we experienced weaker than expected market trends within the U.S
And this was apparent in our Innerwear and Activewear segment results
Innerwear sales declined from last year as online sales growth of over 20% was more than offset by pressure within brick and mortar
Back-to-school trends broadly across retail channels were softer than expected, driven by weak traffic and continued declines in the overall apparel category
We were certainly disappointed that Innerwear sales did not progress as we were expecting in the quarter as a result of these market pressures
However, we were able to hold that share in basics and we saw improving POS trends within our Bra business at certain key accounts
Innerwear's operating margin increased 10 basis points over last year as Booster savings more than offset the declining sales volume
With respect to our Activewear segment, sales increased slightly over last year due to the addition of GTM and double-digit Champion growth in the sporting goods, mid-tier and department store channels
Activewear's operating margin expanded 110 basis points over last year, driven by product mix and Booster savings
Switching to our International segment, as Gerald also highlighted, sales were much stronger than expected in the quarter, increasing roughly 14% in constant currency
Sales in Europe increased 7% in constant currency, driven by Champion growth in both the wholesale and retail channels, with particular strength in Germany and the UK
Within Hanes Europe, sales of our DIM brand increased while online sales were up double digits
Sales in Asia increased over 20% in constant currency due to strong Champion growth across all channels in Japan as well as double-digit Champion growth in Korea
Hanes Australasia also delivered strong growth across both wholesale and consumer directed channels
In Latin America, sales increased over 15% in constant currency, driven by positive Innerwear POS trends in Mexico, the relaunch of Maidenform in Argentina and Innerwear sales in Brazil
Segment operating margin of 13.7% increased 90 basis points over last year driven by sales growth and acquisition synergies
With respect to balance sheet and cash flow highlights, inventory declined roughly 3% over last year in Q3, while cash flow from operations year-to-date improved by $123 million
All year we have built our cash flow at a faster pace than last year through the combination of net income growth and structural improvements in our working capital
Turning to guidance, we narrowed our full year outlook, so please refer to our Press Release and FAQ document for the specific details
As we highlighted with our quarterly guidance back in August, our full-year sales outlook has been tracking to the low end of our range, given the challenging apparel market trends within the U.S
With respect to EPS, we narrowed our range to reflect increased marketing investments to drive market share, a higher mix of international sales relative to our prior expectations, as well as a $0.02 per share drag from the unexpected impact of the Sears Canada bankruptcy and the natural disasters I referred to earlier
And lastly, we expect cash flow from operations to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance range
So to wrap up, we believe we have approached an inflection point in our business
Our growth initiatives are now large enough to offset current market challenges
You saw this in Q3 as we delivered on our guidance and returned to organic growth, and we believe you'll see this in Q4 as we expect to deliver another quarter of organic revenue growth
Looking forward, when you add visible profit and cash flow drivers to this revenue inflection, we believe we are very well-positioned to drive strong shareholder returns for the next several years
And with, that I'll turn the call back over to T
So this is Rick (33:33) Unknown Speaker Hello? Hello?
As we were saying, since we did our acquisitions last summer, we've been steadily deleveraging our balance sheet
On a net debt to EBITDA basis by the end of the year we should be around three times
When you look at that compared to our – the capacity we have under our credit agreements, we look to be able to do up to like $1 billion in acquisitions
I'd also note that we ended the quarter with $400 million on our balance sheet and so between that and the cash flow build that we're experiencing right now, we feel like we have plenty of capacity to do acquisitions as we – as they come up
Unknown Speaker Okay
Great
Thanks
