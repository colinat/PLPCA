Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone
In the first quarter, sales were $23.9 billion, a 4.9% increase from last year
Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.8% in February, 4.3% in March and 6.2% in April
Comps for U.S
stores were positive 6% for the quarter, with positive comps up 6.3% in February, 4.6% in March and 6.8% in April
The cadence of our monthly comps was impacted a bit by weather and by the timing of Easter this year versus last year
Adjusting for Easter, on a like-for-like basis, our U.S
comps were 2.9% in March and 8% in April
Two more comments about our first quarter sales growth
First, for activity purposes, we record comp sales when tender is accepted and we report sales revenue when the transaction is completed
The difference is known as deferred sales
Compared to last year, our deferred sales grew by $116 million
As a result, our reported sales growth was less than our comp sales growth
Second, versus last year fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $71 million
Our total company gross margin was 34.1% for the quarter, a decrease of 9 basis points from last year
As expected, the modest decline in our gross margin was primarily driven by a change in the mix of products sold
For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect our gross margin to decline by approximately 15 basis points from what we reported in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 59 basis points to 20.1%
Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with continued expense control
In the quarter, our expenses were roughly $18 million under our plan, albeit some of the variance was due to timing
While our expenses grew at approximately 39% of our sales growth rate in the first quarter, for fiscal 2017we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 43% of our sales growth rate
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 14% an increase of 50 basis points from last year
Interest and other expense for the first quarter of $241 million up slightly from last year
In the first quarter our effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 36.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year change in our effective tax rate was driven largely by a new FASB stock compensation accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2017. For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%
Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.67 an increase of 16% from last year
Now moving to some additional highlights
During the first quarter, we opened two new stores in the U.S
and one new store in Mexico bringing our total store count to 2,281 and selling square footage to 238 million square feet
Total sales per square foot for the first quarter was $394 up 4.6% from last year
Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter merchandised inventories were $13.6 billion up $390 million from last year and inventory turns were 4.8 times flat to last year
Accounts payable grew by $427 million year-over-year
In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 8.5 million shares of outstanding stock
For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stocks using access cash, bringing total anticipated 2017 share repurchases to $5 billion
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing 12-month
Return on invested capital with approximately 32.3%, 310 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. To wrap up the commentary on our first quarter financial results, we were pleased as sales and earnings were better than we planned
Looking ahead while U.S
GDP forecasts are mixed, housing continues to be a growing asset class, and our sales thus far in May have been very good
But relative to our plan we do anticipate some foreign exchange pressure
So today we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter earnings call
For fiscal 2017, we expect sales to increase by approximately 4.6% with positive comps of approximately 4.6%
For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP
Given our first quarter expense performance we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance
For fiscal 2017, we now expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 11% to $7.15. So, we thank you for your participation in today's call and Catherine we are now ready for questions
Simeon, good morning
So, nothing at this point, and as you know we have an investor conference coming up in December and we’ll give you lot more color about our point of view for fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Yes
There were three big drivers of the deferred revenue growth year-on-year
One you’ve heard commentary about our dot-com sales growth, up 23% year-on-year, not all those sales are completed at the time of that we take the tender
Our dot-com sales now make up 6.6% of our total sales
We also saw growth in our services business
Our services business grew faster than our company average and Ted called out flooring as an example
Those were the two biggest drivers of the deferred sales increase
We would anticipate continues strong growth in those categories
Well, let’s talk about supply chain first
Supply chain did contribute one basis point with gross margin expansion in the first quarter
That’s after three basis points of pressure coming from higher fuel costs
Again, like the demand that we had in the first quarter we were very pleased with our supply chain performance
In the first quarter in fact expenses were out plan, so that a good story
And some of the other drivers, its all part of the portfolio that Ted and the Merchants run and is working just the way we want it
Long, long process
Lumber was a little more than half of that 75 basis points
That was only on the average ticket growth for that company
In terms of performance of big ticket categories that is more driven by appliances and flooring
It’s not so much [Indiscernible]
So, Brian, it was a little choppy in terms of the cadence, and we do think that was weather
If you look at our transactions in March were actually under 1% growth year-on-year and that was all weather-related
And when the weather improved in April the sales came back
So, we always talk to you about bathtub of that first half, but we had a bathtub effect in the first quarter, we did
And so we think now about the first half we would think that the first quarter will be slightly stronger than that second quarter, and the comps for the first half will be about the same as the comps for the back half
I think with all kind of talked this out a lot, and we think Pros went on vacation
And good for them, they were busy, they’ve got more work and then they know what to do it and they took some times off and then they back hard at work
And to your point should we ignore there? I don’t think you should ever ignore a compare
But clearly there is demand that’s being created by this housing market that is very strong
Home prices are up year-over-year over 5%, housing turnover over 4% and aging and housing stock, household formation
We see growth in private fixed residential investment every quarter
It still a long way to go back to reach back to the mean or 4% -- 4.5% of GDP, so lot of good momentum in our business
So, a few things
First as I mentioned, we’ve go some currency pressure coming our way
We estimate that currently pressure to be $250 million
Second, it is the middle of May and it’s a little early to start thinking about looking for the full year, but as I said, sales as far in May has been very good
Ted got some really great data on traffic
You might want to share that
That sales opportunity by the way is $1.3 billion
Matt, if I could add a couple of numbers
The visits were up 15% year-on-year
Our conversion rate increased 30 basis points year-on-year, so if you’re visits are up and you’re conversion is up, your sales are going to grow
And a lot of that is because of the site experience improvements that Kevin and team has made
There’s an appliance retailer that recently announced store closing basically going out of business and we’re seeing sales coming our way and in an environment where they’re liquidating the stores
Yes, very interesting
This is really nothing statistic to me
There are 76 million owned households in the United States and of those there are only 3.2 million that having negative equity in their home
And you go back to 2011, 11 million of those household had negative equity in their home
So the amount shows that since 2011 homeowners have enjoyed 130% increase in wealth, if you will, coming from home price depreciation
So on average $50,000 per household
So, you can imagine at some point, to Ted’s point, they’ll take that down out and do a bigger millwork or total remodel job
Should I jump in? I’ll be happy to jump in
So our Pro business grew twice as fast as our DIY customer in the first quarter
Yes, the sales growth rate was higher than the company average in the first quarter
It’s less than 2% of our sales that we can’t see that in the top line yet, but we will see it as these use cases gain traction
Well, on an unrounded basis inventory turn were slightly better than last year
And for the full year we’re expecting inventory turns to be up year-on-year, a few ten
