Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone
I will provide an overview of business segment performance and highlight some of the key initiatives that are under way
I will then turn the call over to Scott to take us through the financials and our targets for Q2. At our Investor Day in December, we outlined a multiyear plan to further elevate the Starbucks brand, elevate our customer experience, and ultimately amplify Starbucks as a consumer destination around the world
We also reaffirmed our strategic priorities over the next five years and provided more clarity around our ongoing investments in retail, beverage, and digital innovation, as well as in our partners
Looking ahead, we believe that our clear, long range planning, combined with ongoing innovation and a heightened commitment to excellence and execution will enable the creation of meaningful shareholder value
Despite the challenging macro retail environment, Starbucks delivered record revenues, operating margins, and profits in Q1. Each of our business segments contributed to our overall global results, and I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through our performance by geography and segment
Let's begin with the Americas
Our Americas segment had a solid quarter, posting 3% comp growth with 3% comp in the U.S
, and 7% revenue growth
Americas added about 250 net new stores in the quarter, and now operates almost 16,000 stores
When analyzing the 3% comp growth in the U.S
, there are four major points to capture both the strength of the brand and the opportunities to further accelerate comp store growth
First, our beverage category performance was strong
We delivered great hot and cold beverage innovation to our customers, contributing to a total beverage sales increase of 7%
Core beverage contributed one point of comp, and tea grew by nearly 10% in the U.S
and 15% globally
Iced espresso, iced coffee, and handcrafted Teavana shake and iced teas each posted strong double-digit growth
We continue to introduce new Cold Brew varietals and expand our store deployment of Nitro Cold Brew
Second, our food sales were also strong, growing 8% year-on-year, contributing one point of comp, driven mainly by improved attach across all dayparts with continued strength in the morning
Food represents 20% of our total sales, with breakfast sandwich revenues growing 16%, bringing the two-year growth rate to 69%
Sales of premium breakfast sandwiches increased 52%
A third point I'd like to make is the surge in Starbucks gift cards and reloads, both digitally and online
The $2.1 billion of card sales and reloads is a reflection of the strength of our brand, as well as the power of our digital flywheel, which leads to the fourth point
Digital flywheel adoption continues to grow, with almost 13 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S
, up 16% from the same period a year ago
Starbucks Rewards as a percentage of tender is up 4 points from a year ago to 34%, and mobile payment increased to 20% of total transactions
This is up 2 points from last quarter and represents an accelerating trend, driven by the success of Mobile Order & Pay
Total member spend increased 21% year-on-year, driven in part by the strong early success of our recently launched personalization capabilities
Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago
The overwhelming success of Mobile Order & Pay has increased Rewards engagement and created efficiencies at point of sale
But as Howard mentioned, the success of Mobile Order & Pay has also created a new operational challenge that has been building in lock step with volume growth, and it's most pronounced in our highest volume stores at peak, significant congestion at the handoff plane
This congestion resulted in some number of customers who either entered the store or considered visiting a Starbucks store and then did not complete a transaction
Adam Brotman is already driving action in our top 1,000 highest volume Mobile Order & Pay stores to address this issue, including introducing new in-store procedures and tools, adding new roles and resources to specifically support Mobile Order & Pay, and the testing of new digital enhancements, including text message notifications when a mobile order is ready for pickup
Our in-store operational approach continues to evolve as we handle larger volumes of transactions
I will point out that we have been confronted with and solved complexities like this that have been introduced by rapid volume and traffic growth many times over the past several years, and we will solve the challenges presented by Mobile Order & Pay driven traffic increases now
I want to highlight additional plans we have in place to drive comps to mid-single digits for the full year
These actions align with the five-year strategic plan and are focused on near-term comp growth
First, product innovation
In beverage, we are building a broader beverage platform around Nitro and other Cold Brew offerings complemented by innovation around Frappuccino and Teavana iced teas
Regarding food innovation, we introduced delicious, healthy, high-protein, Sous Vide Egg Bites this month that have been extremely well received and are driving both incremental revenue and increased attach
We are expanding production capacity to meet incremental demand for these egg bites
We're also launching the highly-anticipated gluten free breakfast sandwich soon
As we discussed at Investor Day, we have a growth opportunity in the lunch daypart with innovation around a fresh, healthy lunch concept that will be tested in the Chicago market this summer in Starbucks stores
Digital flywheel innovation is a critical part of the plan
In addition to ongoing improvements in personalization, including increasing triggered offers based on customers' recent Rewards activity, we are also rolling out suggestive selling that will recommend items to a customer during the order process
The voice enabled ordering capability we demonstrated at Investor Day will begin deployment in the coming months
To accelerate our progress implementing this plan, John Culver, who leads Starbucks Global Retail, made a leadership change in the U.S
with Kris Engskov, a 14-year partner, who most recently led EMEA, assuming leadership of our U.S
retail business reporting to John
Kris was an operator in the U.S
retail business prior to his assignment leading EMEA, and it's great to have him back in the U.S
retail
In addition, I've asked Howard to act as a coach to Kris as we focus on energizing and galvanizing our store managers and field leadership around the many growth initiatives rolling out now and in the quarters ahead
Tony Matta, who currently leads our U.S
CPG business will succeed Kris leading global channel development
Tony brings 20 years of experience in the CPG industry and has done a fantastic job leading the Starbucks U.S
CPG business
Let's move on to China Asia-Pacific
In Q1, CAP once again Starbucks fastest growing segment with revenues up 18% and comp sales up 5%
We added approximately 300 net new stores in CAP in the quarter, and now operate 6,700 stores across 15 countries
Our newest class of company operated stores in China continues the trend of outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage
And we celebrated a milestone in Q1 by opening our 1,000th store in Korea
Korea now joins China and Japan as countries in CAP with over 1,000 Starbucks stores
We remain on plan to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP by 2021. We opened over 160 new Starbucks stores in China in the quarter
We now operate over 2,600 stores in China and remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores by 2021. Comps in China grew 6% in the quarter, with 4% increase in traffic
We continue to build the China digital flywheel with active members growing over 25% year-on-year and the new partnership with Tencent showing phenomenal results
WeChat Pay already represents 20% of total transactions in China and the soft launch of WeChat social gifting to 4 million Starbucks customers in China has generated overwhelming attention
Social gifting is the next frontier of our digital flywheel
In addition, Teavana continued to perform well throughout CAP with tea revenues growing over 40% in both Japan and China following the launch of custom handcrafted Teavana beverages sold at Starbucks
The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling a great Starbucks experience that is deepening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region
Let's move on to EMEA
EMEA continues to see success from the repositioning of its store portfolio, with system comps growing 3%
We opened approximately 100 net new stores in the quarter and now operate over 2,700 EMEA stores, only 18% of which are company operated
Non-equity stores are driving our performance, despite an increasingly challenging operating environment
Reported total revenues in Q1 decreased 16% year-on-year to $262 million in EMEA
However, when adjusted for the 21% impact of foreign exchange, the sale of 35 stores to franchisees and local licensees in the UK, and the transfer of 144 stores in Germany to AmRest, an existing EMEA license partner, revenue growth was 5%
We remain confident in our strategy and long-term prospects for EMEA
On to Channel Development
Channel Development delivered record revenue, up 8% year-on- year, on top of a very strong 16% increase in Q1 a year ago
We continued our strong track record of growth as measured by total U.S
coffee consumption in Q1. Starbucks K-Cups posted sales growth of 10.3%, six times the total K-Cup category growth of only 1.7%
We are the market share leader in this category at 17.7%
Starbucks is also the number-one premium Roast and Ground packaged coffee brand
Our Roast and Ground sales grew 6% in the quarter, compared to total packaged coffee category decline of 1.6%
This contributed a point of share, taking us to a 14% share position
As we mentioned at Investor Day, while we expect to see continued deceleration in the category and increased competition for both Roast and Ground and K-Cup, we will continue to innovative, gain share, and drive growth
Turning to our Ready-to-Drink business
Our NACP partnership delivered excellent results with system sales, as measured by IRI, up 8%
Share of the total liquid coffee and energy segment grew to 14%, fueled by strength in bottled Frappuccino, Doubleshot energy drink and new chilled multi-serve products
We continue to expand our CPG footprint
In EMEA, Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules have already become the number three brand in the Nespresso compatible capsule category in the UK
In China, Starbucks Frappuccino is now available for purchase at over 21,000 points of distribution, enabled by our partner, Tingyi
And in the U.S
, our partner, Anheuser-Busch Inbev begins the rollout of new Teavana ready-to-drink teas in February
In our 25 years as a public company, our aspirations have never been higher and our opportunities never greater
As we pursue our multi-year plan, we will remain true to our mission and core values and a commitment of serving others and sharing success
In closing, I want to personally thank the more than 300,000 partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron for the work they do every single day in our stores
Ultimately, it is our partners who delivered the record results we announced today
With that, I'll hand over the call to Scott to take you through our Q1 financials in detail
Yeah, David, this is Kevin
I'll give you a little bit of more perspective on this
If you look at stores that had more than 20% of their transaction volume coming from Mobile Order & Pay at peak, this quarter we had 1,200 stores in the U.S
Last quarter, it was 600 stores, so it's doubled in this last quarter
So, there's significant uptick in the usage of Mobile Order & Pay, and we've now – to the point where we doubled the number of stores that had more than 20% of their transaction volume coming in at peak
Now, what that creates is, when those orders come in at that volume, it's creating congestion at the handoff plane
And so, when a customer – a potential customer might walk in the store, it used to be they would look at the line at the point of sale, and if that line looked too long, they might decide not to do a transaction at that time and come back later
Now when customers walk into the store, we've alleviated the congestion at the point of sale line and now we have congestion at the handoff plane
So, they might look at the number of customers around the handoff plane and the number of beverages on the handoff plane, and that might create the signal to them that they are going to wait to do their transaction
We can't specifically quantify the number
We do think that was the most significant contributing factor to our 3% comp
So, it is something that over the last five years or six years we've had to continuously solve problems of the increased scaling of transactions in our store
And so we are focused on a set of solutions
Adam Brotman is on point for those solutions, and maybe I'll hand over to Adam to walk through the set of things that you have in motion now and kind of where you're going with the action plan
Yeah, Greg, this is Kevin
I think consistent with, sort of, what we shared at Investor Day, the big opportunity for us to accelerate the contribution of food comp to their total comp is at lunch, and we continue to perform very well on the breakfast in the morning daypart with breakfast sandwiches in our bakery case, and the opportunity we see to reaccelerate comp contribution from food is at lunch
And I mentioned, we will – you will be seeing some new food items at lunch, and a new concept around a fresh, healthy culinary experience that we're going to be able to implement in our Starbucks stores in Chicago by this summer
And that is where we see the opportunity
