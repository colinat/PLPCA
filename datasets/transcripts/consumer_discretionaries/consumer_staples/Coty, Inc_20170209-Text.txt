Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's second quarter conference call
I'm delighted to be here speaking with you leading my first earnings call as Coty's CEO
Let me take a moment to reiterate for you Coty's ambition, as previously articulated by Bart, which I embrace and will continue to use as the foundation of my strategic vision
Our ambition in beauty is to strive to become over time a global industry leader by being a clear challenger in beauty, delighting our consumers, which ultimately should translate into revenue growth, strong cash flow and the creation of long-term shareholder value
Having completed my first four months in the role, it's clear to me that the combination of our iconic and emerging brands, energized employees and the comprehensive strategy we are laying out for the new organization, will position us well to reach our ambition
Today is our first time reporting as a combined company following the closing of the P&G Beauty transaction October 1. Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter
The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market, on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division, and the distraction associated with the integration efforts
I want to be clear that while the complexity of the merger, the sheer magnitude of this integration and simultaneous reorganization of our total company have impacted our organization and our short-term results, I have initiated additional changes as I'm not satisfied with the underlying performance of several parts of the business
So although fiscal 2017 is a transitional year, as previously discussed, we have already started to tackle the growth challenges of our business
As it is my first earnings call and an introduction to how I think about the business, I wanted to go in much more detail into the trends and strategies that I plan going forward
To reiterate my assessment from the last earnings call, the Coty business is composed of three divisions in different states of evolution
The Professional Beauty division is performing well overall, fueled by the continued success of the hair portfolio
The Luxury division has been improving its revenue trends in parallel with decreasing wholesale distribution to create a healthy business
And we expect the momentum to continue in the coming quarters
However, the Consumer Beauty division is facing a number of challenges, and I'll come back to Consumer Beauty in more detail later
I will now discuss my strategic vision for the company and the specific actions we are implementing to continue the reshaping of our business in order to address the current challenges and return the combined company to growth
First and foremost, we have an amazing portfolio of iconic brands that are loved by millions of consumers throughout the world, including COVERGIRL, Rimmel and Clairol in Consumer Beauty; Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and Gucci in Luxury; and Wella and OPI in Professional Beauty
Our first focus on our established global brands is to continue to strengthen and nurture them, particularly as some of them were previously essentially orphaned within a larger corporation
Our second focus is to cultivating (05:03) few of the brands with higher growth potential in our portfolio
Our third focus is to stabilize the remaining brands, whether through active portfolio rationalization or other majors
Finally, we're also completing the shaping of our new organization, including making sure we have the right talent in key roles to drive growth in our brands
We aim to achieve these objectives through four key pillars
First, we are repositioning some of the brands in order to reconnect these brands with consumers, building on their already strong brand equity
Second, we are making significant changes to our innovation and product development process in parts of the organization
Third, we are accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation, including e-commerce
And fourth, we are working to significantly ramp our in-store execution
I would like to also highlight that we see a substantial opportunity to use the strength of our growth portfolio brands to reach more and more consumers all over the world, as many of our brands still have substantial opportunity for geographical expansion leveraging our global distribution footprint
On the M&A front, we're continuing to strengthen the Coty portfolio through highly strategic acquisitions and planned portfolio rationalization
Both ghd and Younique are expected to be accretive in year one, on both net revenue growth and adjusted earnings
From a strategic perspective, ghd expands our assortment of premium products for the Salon channel, while the partnership with Younique leverages unique high-growth e-commerce platform and social selling direct-to-consumer business model
On the portfolio rationalization, we have identified the non-core portfolio brands and are now exploring potential alternatives for these brands, including divestitures
So the comprehensive reshaping of our business for growth is continuing at pace
I would now like to take some time to discuss each of Coty's new divisions and the specific action we are implementing to address current challenges and return the combined company to growth
I'll start with Consumer Beauty
This division represents approximately half of our combined portfolio in our revenues with around half of the division sales concentrated in color cosmetics, and the other half composed of retail hair, body care and mass fragrances
The Q2 results of the Consumer Beauty division were clearly disappointing, as I mentioned before
The main drivers behind these results are the fact that some of the key brands were orphaned in the previous large organization, the high competitive market pressure, and the changing market environment
Additionally, we're still working through highly elevated (08:08) trade inventories that were built before the close of the P&G Beauty transaction
So let me go a little deeper into each of these categories, starting with color cosmetics
The color cosmetics category has been growing at an average at a low-single digit pace in key regions
But the category has been rapidly changing with consumers' focus much more on trends in ancillary products, and engaging much more online to discuss and determine what they purchase
A lot of the growth has come from entry (08:44) and smaller brands that are fast to respond to trends and engage with their customers through digital platforms and innovative in-store activation
We are behind on this curve, but we have already taken action and we are working on a multi-pronged approach
First, we are revamping our product development, as well as our communication process and programs
Aided by our own digital agency, Beamly, as well as more strategic partnership with our key partner suppliers, the new innovation process is focused on spotting the trends early and slashing our average time to market, which is currently about 12, 18 months
In parallel, we are working to digitally transform our brands and overall our in-store presence to make sure we're present the best way possible where our consumers shop
As part of these efforts, we will be shifting more money from traditional media to digital media and investment in the store
Finally, we are also working with retailers to improve our partnership relationship, bringing value to them and their customers
From a brand perspective, we believe we have a strong portfolio of cosmetic brands, but we'll be re-launching several of them to regain relevance with consumers
Specifically, we will be re-launching COVERGIRL and Max Factor in the coming fiscal year, with new brand positioning, new creations, new packaging and new in-store appearance
We will also be announcing Sally Hansen's market approach to build a stronger emotional connection with the consumer
While the full COVERGIRL and Max Factor brand re-launches will kick off in few quarters, we're already seeing some bright spots in the business
COVERGIRL So Lashy! launch is the biggest mascara launch of the season
The innovative (10:35) product, strong consumer insight and the disruptive marketing campaign featuring James Charles and Nura Afia have driven disproportion engagement and above expected results for this novel mascara that works for all lash types
This multi-pronged approach will take time to yield results, but we strongly believe this is the right way to strengthen our business for the long term
Turning to retail hair, we believe that Coty has a real opportunity to revive the category through innovation, stronger in-store execution and consumer engagement
The category has been dormant for the last 10 years, particularly in developed countries
We believe the biggest players in the category, including Clairol, have been leveraging the category for profit with no real innovation
Our analysis indicates that consumers are intimidated by the difficulty of the shopping for hair color in stores and the complexity of the hair coloring process at home
In turn, the category penetration has been going down, as consumers would rather go to their professional stylist
As a result of these category issues, retailers have been progressively capping the shelf allocation, which in turn has limited the color assortment, preventing many women from finding their shade
Against this backdrop, we believe we have an exciting pipeline of innovation in the near future that will revitalize the retail hair category and transform it into a beauty category instead of a functional category
The Consumer Beauty division will take some time to return to growth, and I'm confident the strategic action that we are putting in place are the right steps to strengthen Coty's position in this beauty category
Turning to the Luxury division, which accounts for approximately a third of the combined company revenues, we believe we have a very strong portfolio of brands, which span the spectrum of the prestige fragrance category from low premium to ultra-premium
And we are continuing with our strategy of making our portfolio even more prestige
Coty Luxury had strong results across several of our brands and pillars in Q2. However, the division performance in Q2 versus last year was impacted by our continued wholesale distribution reduction, which is a positive for the health of the business, and by the difficult innovation comparison versus the previous year
On the positive side, we launched the new Hugo Boss fragrance, The Scent For Her, which marked the brand's successful entry into the female category
This was the number one launch in the UK and number two in Spain
The feedback for the new Gucci Guilty marketing campaign has also been very positive, driving market share growth in the Gucci Guilty franchise in both the U.S
and Italy
The core brand continued to grow in market across all key countries, supported by the Flora de Parfum launch
philosophy also continued to grow in the quarter, fueled by its direct-to-consumer platform
From a go-to-market perspective, we are continuing to gain share in the travel retail channel where we already have a disproportionate share of the fragrance category
We evolved to successfully establish a local affiliate in China, steadily improving our distribution in in-market performance
So, as we look to the second half of 2017, we remain excited by the robust pipeline of initiatives across the Hugo Boss, Gucci and Calvin Klein brands, amongst others
And while there is more to do on wholesale distribution, we do expect revenue trends in the Luxury division to continue to improve in the coming quarters
In the Professional Beauty division, which accounts for approximately a fifth of combined company revenues, we're maintaining strong momentum in the hair category, while broadening our portfolio with ghd within hair appliances and a critical adjacency in nail with OPI
Our Salon hair portfolio continued to grow low to mid-single-digit, consistent with the performance in the two previous fiscal years, and ahead of the salon market, which is growing at approximately 1%
We are excited by the continued strong performance over the largest brand, Wella, as well as the System Professional brand which is tapping into the premium care segment and the growing trends of customization and personalization with this EnergyCode technology
ghd, as the new key brand of the Professional Beauty portfolio, has performed well in its first few weeks within Coty
And we expect momentum to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, notably building on its geographical footprint expansion beyond its core countries
All together, we expect the Professional Beauty division to see good growth on a combined company basis through the rest of the fiscal 2017 and beyond
Following on the heels of the ghd acquisition, I'm excited about our partnership with Younique
I'm extremely pleased that both of the founders, Derek and Melanie, will continue to lead the business, which leverages the exponential potential of online peer-to-peer social selling
The partnership will combine Younique's high growth e-commerce platform with Coty R&D and innovation know-how, as well as extensive manufacturing supply chain capabilities
And speaking of digitally focused investments, I would like to touch on the substantial effort that we're implementing to accelerate Coty's digital transformation
These actions span four major components
In marketing science, we are now able to understand and reach our consumers with far higher levels of targeting precision, thereby enabling a step change in our social listening and trend scanning capabilities to better keep our brand teams in markets
In terms of brand content, we are testing creative to better align with target consumer segments and drive high and low (16:55) media effectiveness
In media optimization, we have continued the transition to digital from 21% to over 30% globally in just this past six months, while also outperforming engagement and cost benchmarks by up to 30%, driving further media efficiency
Looking at it as omnichannel (17:18), we will begin to create new platforms for deeper personalization, including online and new store activation programs
With regards to the rest of fiscal 2017, we continue to expect the decline of the net revenue at constant currency to slow down in the second half, excluding the contribution from Younique and ghd
On the P&G Beauty Business merger, the integration is progressing as expected, with no major issues to-date
And we are reiterating our previously communicated $750 million synergy target by fiscal 2020. If I can summarize, fiscal 2017 remains a challenging transitional year, but one that we believe is setting the stage for enormous potential as a global leader and challenger in beauty
I believe the new Coty is a much stronger company than the two previous organizations running separately, and now that we have full control of the combined brand portfolio, I'm even more confident about the great long-term potential of the new Coty
I will now turn it over to Patrice
Thanks, Steph, for the question
Look, this is a big reorganization because both companies were not organized and structured this way prior to the merger
So we have created three divisions
Both Coty Legacy and P&G Beauty Business were not managed this way, so clearly having to manage now – having managing the company with three end-to-end division where they have full responsibility for the entire portfolio and the P&L, this is clearly a different way of working that has been embedded in the organization at the moment
So clearly, the way of working has changed for a lot of our people, both coming from the Coty Legacy, from P&G or from the outside
And another key element of differentiation in the structure that we had chosen is that we have end-to-end responsibility with the division, as I said, but also that the P&L sits with the countries
And this is quite an also, I would say, significant departure from how the business was managed especially in the P&G previous business where the control of the P&L was more central, I would say
So, I don't know if I'm answering fully your question, but in my opinion this is – I would say, are the two key elements that are making this reorganization complex, but at the same time, in my opinion, paving the way for the future success of the company
Thanks, Bill, for the question
Look, we believe that we have an amazing set of brands and our brands are loved by millions
So our strategy in terms of repositioning the brands, and you mentioned COVERGIRL, it's not just the only one, is key to reconnect with the consumers
I mentioned that I was not satisfied with some of the elements of the COVERGIRL position in the past, but actually we are now working on reinvigorating the innovation process, upgrading the packaging, the way it looks in-store, we're going to be more modern, more focused on looks
So clearly, we have a lot in our pipeline to re-launch the brand in the future
I have to say that we've been also exposing some of our thoughts and ideas to the retailers and actually the reaction is very positive
So going back to distribution, this is a temporary situation, but we are very, very confident that all the actions that we are going to put in place will actually allow COVERGIRL to retain the position that we want to have in the market and improve
And as a matter of fact, COVERGIRL is still the brand with the strongest equity in mass color cosmetic in the U.S
, and that gives us an enormous level of confidence for the future potential of going back to growth
Hi, Lauren
Thanks for the question
First, the plan to re-launch COVERGIRL and Max Factor are for fiscal 2018. I think this was a part of your question
Regarding the investment, I'm actually convinced that we have enough funds to re-launch the brands, not just these two, but also the other brands
One thing that I would like to point out is the fact that actually the P&G brands, we're spending a substantially higher level of marketing versus what we were spending in the Coty Legacy
So the combination of the funds that we have in the new company, around approximately 26% as a percent of net revenues, in my opinion, are actually enough or more than enough to re-launch the brands, and because there are a lot of things that we need to do are truly in terms of the way we connect with consumers
And one of the key shift is going to be really going from traditional TV, traditional media to digital engagement
And then as you know, moving that actually creates a lot of efficiencies, so it's not just a matter of spending more, but it's a matter of spending better and connecting better with the consumers, making sure that we speak to them in the right way where they are
And a lot of times, they're not necessarily watching TV, but they are on different digital platforms
I believe that we're making a lot of great progress in preparing strong actions for the Luxury division to return to growth in the next few quarters
We had a strong pipeline coming
Yes, in the last Christmas, we also had an unfavorable, let's say, benchmark versus the previous innovation from the past years
So the Marc Jacobs Decadence which was a success in the previous season or the Hugo Boss The Scent For Him, which was also a big success
But if I look at some of the elements and some of the things we've done, I'm actually quite pleased because Hugo Boss The Scent For Her, which really marks the entry of Hugo Boss in the female segment, has been a success with number one in the UK, number two in Spain
Chloe continues to do very well
And we have a lot of brands which actually are performing very well in the market and outperforming the market
So we're confident about the actions we're putting in place for the Luxury division
Joe, we will not quantify specifically the impact of each of them, although Patrice has mentioned the – that the overall impact has been 300 basis points on our growth in our Q2. So in terms of details, I will not be able to give it to you
What we can say is that we expect our revenues decline in the second half of 2017 to slow down
And, of course, we expect further (49:20) improvements afterwards
And it's also quite important that we look at the fact that we have three divisions
And the three divisions are in a different state of evolution because Professional Beauty is actually growing and the hair portfolio is growing even faster
Last year, as I said, it's improving the trends because Q2 was already better than Q1, despite we're still tackling wholesale distribution reduction
And we expect, of course, the business to be healthy and to continue to improve in the next few quarters
And it will take time to really return to growth in Consumer Beauty, which is where we have the biggest challenges, as I explained before
I don't believe this a big risk factor, and I'll explain why in a second
I believe that now that we are the owner of the entire portfolio, we've finally been able to engage with our customers, with the retailers, in a much stronger way
I truly believe in partnership
I believe partnership is when really there is a win-win situation for both parties
And myself and the team are keenly focused on establishing a much stronger partnership level with the key retailers
We are in the process of doing that
We are engaging with all the key retailers, U.S
but also in the other markets
And the reaction and the spirit is actually very good, because they are seeing the plans that we're putting in place
We're engaging with them
In some cases, we're working together of course in preparing these plans
And when you approach a partnership this way, and in this case, we're also working on re-launching the very iconic brands which are loved by consumers, you know, in the respective markets
Retailers are really appreciative of some of these plans and therefore, I see the future in a bright way, because I believe that the re-launches of the brands will bring us success in the market
Dara, I think actually that one of the key things we could do is also to look at the investment strategy and readjust the investments among the different brands
So there will be some brands, the one that has the higher growth potential that will receive more investment, and some others that eventually will receive a bit less
So we are in the process of exactly doing this, and I think it's a very important financial discipline to look at also retirement investment
Regarding on your question on spending more overall, I want to go back to my previous answer which is that when you start shifting the traditional media to digital, you actually have way more money to play with and to invest, to be able to reach more consumers
Consumers are truly spending a disproportionate amount of time on social media, on social platforms
And, I believe that some of our brands have not played the right role in the social engagement, and by shifting the investment actually we will achieve not only the consumers that we want to achieve, but also in the right place and the right time, and the overall connection with the brand will improve
And this is clearly part of the logic of why I answered before that we believe we have enough funds for our future success and re-launches
So first, regarding the inventory, Wendy
So we need to put this in a bit of a perspective on the fact that we announced the acquisition of P&G in July 2015, and we closed the merger – so we closed the deal in October 2016. That's a 15-months period in which we were not able to actually work on any of the P&G brands
We were two competing companies, and we were basically not working at all on that
So it's a long time for brands to be announced that they would have been sold, but to still be in the hands of their previous owners
So that clearly can cause a higher inventory, and we're not going to now detail specifically the level, but I think Patrice has explained that all the business, the transition issues, which includes a significant high inventory, were around the 300 basis points of growth
So clearly it was quantified
And in terms of distractions, clearly this is a big reorganization
This is not just putting together two companies, because at the same time we have decided to manage the company in a divisional structure
Now, the choice of the divisional structure in my opinion is absolutely the right choice for the future, because it does allow a level of focus and capabilities and competencies, which are dedicated to specific categories and channels
So, fragrance and skin care in the prestige channel, in the luxury, and clearly color cosmetic and hair color and so on in the mass market, and hair and nail in professional
So this is – the level of change is quite large and this is why it's causing the distraction because at the same time, we're in the middle of the integration of the system, which Patrice mentioned
We are not really fully performed
And Patrice, I think, mentioned the timing of the exit from the TSAs
Regarding having all the people in the right places, we had clearly disorganization clearly meant that a lot of people had new jobs, so they had to move from different places to start the new job on October 3, and I believe that we have now a much stronger set of leaders in place
Of course, we always look to continue to improve the bench and that's part of what we need to do to be successful in the future
So, let me comment on that, Mark, on Younique
I believe Younique is highly strategic, and I really believe that the online peer-to-peer social selling has a lot of potential
And our choice is driven clearly by wanting to partner with a company that has developed a very, very successful business in this area
And, of course, by our ambition of growing this business by also looking at geographical expansion and further category expansion
If you think that Younique has mainly had – it's a business, a brand with the color cosmetic, I believe that this brand and in general the platform has the potential to be expanded more
And so – plus I think that e-commerce for us is a key focus for the future
And the acquisition or the partnership with Younique is a stepping stone for us to improve our capabilities, strengthen our capability in e-commerce
Thanks, Jason, for the question
So when we think about COVERGIRL, first of all as I mentioned before the brand, the COVERGIRL, still has the first – the number one equity in the U.S
in the mass color cosmetic
I think it's quite important to remind ourself as well that we're talking about a brand which is iconic and loved by millions of consumers in the U.S
Looking at what we plan to do, first of all, we plan to build on the COVERGIRL roots
I think, thinking about the old positioning, every woman can feel that she's a COVERGIRL
I think it's quite important that we don't completely depart from there
But we reinterpret the positioning in a much more modern way, in a more sophisticated way, so that we connect, again, and more with the consumers
Within the re-launch, we are looking clearly at upgrading the packaging and the way we look in-store in a more modern way, in a more sophisticated way, in a way that would allow for easier navigation
So going back to your question, it's not just a matter of spending and then choosing the right platform to connect, but it's also how we connect and how we communicate with the consumers across all the different touch points
So I'll start with your second question, then I'll move back to the first
So in terms of how I think and operate in terms of hiring from the outside, I believe that we always need to have a mix between internal promotion and hiring from the outside
Whenever the capability is not present internally, it's always good to tap into the amazing talent that are out there
At the same time, if we have the talent in the house, that's clearly very, very good
And this is different from how other companies have done it in the past because some companies just privileged promotion from the inside
Regarding your first question, which is about the mobility and the cross-fertilization across the different divisions, first of all I think we need to say that the three divisions require a level of expertise because the knowledge of the category and the channels is very important
This is why also we have decided to structure ourself with the three divisions
That being said, I also believe that people will have to move across divisions in order to fertilize on success and learnings and on capabilities
So it's going to be a mix of both in answering your first question as well
So, when in terms of mass fragrance, Linda, so the mass fragrance clearly is suffering as a category overall because of certain dynamics
One of the key element that I think is affecting the mass fragrance is the fact that you – it's very difficult in the store environment to smell the fragrance, the juice
So that's one of the key driver for trying the new fragrances, and that's still a key barrier there
And I think this is an issue that we in the industry all need to work together with the retailers to try to overcome this barrier
The second point is that within mass fragrance, I think we need to distinguish between celebrities and other lifestyle brands
Within celebrities, it's fair to say that the – I would say the last brand of the celebrity brand is decreased, has decreased significantly just because the brand name and the hype behind the celebrity is now shorter
It's just that's what's happening
Now, when you look at the other side on the lifestyle brands, we have brands like Bruno Banani or adidas or Max, which are actually great brands that we plan to focus in countries like Germany, Russia
These are brands that are doing well
They are, again, iconic brands in the lifestyle mass fragrance in the specific countries
And we believe that they have potential
So again, it's a mixed sort of dynamic within the category
