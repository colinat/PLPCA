Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone
I'm pleased that in the second quarter we delivered our financial targets
Our sales grew solidly, up 5% in constant currency
It was a meaningful acceleration from the first three months
In constant currency, our adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 5%, reflecting strong growth in high profit channels and disciplined expense management coupled with phased growth leverage
During the quarter, we enhanced many important strategic growth levers which created positive momentum across our diversified business in our brands, channels, geographies and categories
These gains were fueled by strong strides in our innovation, social media and digital engagement
We continue to make priority investments through our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which is proceeding according to plan
I will elaborate on each of these in a moment
Our two biggest challenges currently are the brick-and-mortar business in U.S
mid-tier department stores, which continues to be impacted by soft traffic and a slowdown in consumer purchasing in the Middle East
Additionally, Hong Kong continued to be soft, and we remain cautious about the impact of political issues and terrorism affecting our business in certain markets
We also continued to be penalized by the strength of the U.S
dollar
Despite these headwinds, we continue to successfully activate many of the elements of our strategy, which give us confidence in the strength and sustainability of our business growth
The first successful element of our strategy is the positive momentum of our diverse brand portfolio, and we continuously build from this strategic advantage
In the quarter, our best performers were our mid-sized and luxury brands, which continue to gain devoted consumers and strengthen their desirable product offering and services
They are headed on a path to become big brands
Tom Ford, La Mer, Jo Malone, Darphin and the brands we acquired in the past few years generated impressive constant currency double digit growth globally
Tom Ford products were particularly well received, and the brand grew in every category in every region
Two of our big brands generated improved sales and grew globally in constant currency
The Estée Lauder brand sales increased mid-single digits with positive growth both in skin care and makeup
Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ was the largest U.S
skin care launch in calendar 2015 according to NPD
The brands' makeup sales increased in every region and globally were up double digits led by foundations and lip products
Estée Lauder brand grew in every region, which included an acceleration in China and in travel retail
Makeup fueled growth in the UK where the brand has a high makeup penetration
global business also grew in constant currency, as we had anticipated
The brand international business further accelerated with double digit gains in most market as well as in travel retail
In the U.S
sales showed improvement versus the first quarter, but still declined, due primarily to weak traffic in brick-and-mortar mid-tier department store and its tourist-focused freestanding stores
We expect M•A•C
international sales to increase further in the second half of the fiscal year with continued rapid online growth, creative innovation, expanded consumer coverage in overseas markets including launching in new cities, improved merchandise in store and accelerating its successful efforts in social media
Our aim is to strengthen the brand competitiveness in the U.S
while investing behind its international momentum
We also strengthened our portfolio with the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, two of the fastest growing prestige makeup brands
With a strong millennial following, they extended our presence in specialty-multi retail, which is one of the fastest growing channels for prestige beauty
Too Faced joined our company in mid-December, just as it was introducing its Sweet Peach collection, which became its most successful launch ever
The collection attracted nearly 100,000 consumers online who waited up to four hours to make a purchase
We were excited about the prospect of maximizing the potential of BECCA and Too Faced forward, as we are doing with our other new brands
The other acquisitions we made over the last two years are growing rapidly
We continue to integrate them into the company while we expand their consumer coverage and offerings
As an example, we launched Le Labo in Nordstrom and created a new fragrance set, which were popular gifts and best sellers online
Our important strategy of diversifying our distribution to expand our consumer coverage is progressing well
We are evolving the company distribution footprint to meet consumers' changing shopping patterns
We are accelerating the execution of the strategy as some U.S
department stores closed unproductive doors while our most profitable channels delivered outstanding performances, including specialty-multi retail, travel retail and online, all of which rose double digits in the quarter
We have deep experience successfully managing our business across a wide variety of distribution channels, for example in the UK and in many European countries
In a fast-growing specialty-multi retail channel, we are increasing our presence by launching more brands globally to reach new consumers
In the quarter, we launched Estée Lauder initially in 30 ULTA stories in the U.S
and on ULTA
com and had very strong results
Clinique's expansion in the channel included more than 50 new doors with Sephora in JCPenney where it was the number one skin care brand in those doors
Outside the U.S
, Clinique launched in the largest specialty-multi retailer in Korea
In travel retail, our strategy to make our limited distribution brands more widely available and offer a broader portfolio of brands in the channel has yielded outstanding results
We have broadened our makeup offerings in travel retail to capture growing demand while Jo Malone growth has helped drive a reinvigorated fragrance business, and we are introducing some of our newer artisanal fragrance brands to airport locations
Our retail sales growth was more than double the 8% passenger traffic growth in the channel, as more than half of our top 30 travel retail markets posted double digit gains
However, it bears mentioning that travel retail remains volatile, as political issues as well currency fluctuation can cause significant changes in travel patterns
We continue to execute on our e-commerce strategy, which deliver accelerating double digit growth in the quarter, as we supported our own sites and retailer sites with new programs and innovation
Our sales were strong across brand sites, led by M•A•C, as well as retailers and third-party sites
Traffic in orders rose strong double digits compared to last year
We opened our – or launched an approximately 100 new sites globally for our brands and products, and began selling online for the first time in Hong Kong, the Middle East, and the Balkans
In North America, several brands had record-breaking online sales during holidays, including Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins and Aveda
We continue to focus on mobile engagement and saw significant growth in traffic, which drove m-commerce sales increase of 75% over the Thanksgiving Cyber Monday weekend
Our brands on retailers' site also posted double digit growth in the quarter
Our online business was exceptionally strong in China, where sales nearly doubled, thanks to a highly successful single day on Tmall
During that event on November 11, sales of our six brand stores on Tmall were twice that of previous year
At Estée Lauder, most of the consumers who purchased products that day were new to the brand on Tmall, illustrating the success of our strategy to reach new consumer through different channels
From a geographic standpoint, two of the largest markets we had expected to improve this quarter did so
Our business in France showed solid growth, and our U.S
sales improved, led by our high-end fragrance brands, which were big winners at holidays
Estée Lauder's Blockbuster Set helped drive traffic and sold out weeks before Christmas
Our sales in China were strong, with many of our brands rising double digits
La Mer was a standout, driven by the successful launch of its Renewal Oil and Skin Color Collection, a key entry in the fast-growing area that bridges skin care and makeup
The Skin Color line is at the incremental sales, and having a positive halo effect on the brands' skin care business
Makeup continue to be fast-growing category in China, and we are responding to the demand
M•A•C's growth in China was outstanding, as lipstick sales rose strongly
The brand's upcoming launch on Tmall is expected to further drive sales, particularly in cities without brick-and-mortar
We expect Estée Lauder brands' momentum in China to continue
In our third quarter, we plan to launch its best-selling Double Wear Foundation in a cash room compact, (12:51) a package innovation that is coveted by Chinese consumers
Looking at our categories now
Our three major ones are growing solidly on a constant currency basis
Skin care returned to growth, and we have created a new profile growth engine with a fragrance category, with our now extensive portfolio of high-end fragrances, which includes Jo Malone, Tom Ford, AERIN at Zegna Sensa, (13:20) as well as newer brands such as Kilian, Frédéric Mall, and Le Labo
They had growth of nearly 30% during the quarter
These luxury fragrance brands were primarily powered by strong new fragrance launches and social media
In addition, innovation is driving our success across multiple engines of growth, expanding our brands, regions, channels, and target consumer groups
We are leveraging opportunities across the largest, fastest-growing subcategories in areas of consumer benefits while creating a leading new breakthroughs
We are increasing our speed to market and creating more superior products
Additionally, our research and development team continues to develop new proprietary technology platform, and our innovative concept extend beyond product to also include packaging, delivery systems, merchandising, services, and even new approaches to digital engagement
One of our numerous products in packaging innovations is Clinique's Fresh Pressed Daily Booster
Launching this month, the Booster represents a new subcategory for our company
The product concentrated vitamin C is intended to be freshly pressed into our moisturizer to immediately brighten and even skin tone
Fresh Pressed should also increase sales of Clinique core moisturizer business, since they are used together
Our brands are also focusing innovation around hero products and hero franchises, creating new offerings around a core collection is very efficient, and draws renewed attention to the brand priorities
For example, Estée Lauder recently introduced new products to reinforce its two biggest franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, and it paid off, as both grew double digits
, sales of the core Advanced Night Repair Serum rose 17%, boosted by its innovative Intensive Recovery Ampoules
And a new eye mask that just launched last month as part of the franchise should further lift the serum and the entire collection
I'm proud that several of these products are being recognized for their innovation
Last month, Estée Lauder received Marie Claire's prestigious Prix d'Excellence Award in research and development for three products: Advanced Night Repair Powerfoil Mask, Advanced Night Repair Ampoules, and Revitalizing Supreme+
This award honors the most Innovative products of the year
Our innovation is helped by our brands' and retailers' websites, which play a key role as a marketing vehicle to raise awareness of our new products
Millions of people can research the latest launches and read ratings and reviews before purchasing
We will continue to invest in capabilities to further expand our presence online, and our brands are making important strides to stay on the cutting edge of social media, which continues to strongly influence beauty choices
As an example, in the last years, M•A•C has significantly increased its digital engagement
The number of global Instagram followers of M•A•C has increased by 75% to 40 million and its number of global Facebook fans has climbed sharply
M•A•C has launched local Instagram's account in several markets including Brazil, Germany and Russia and the content is shoppable
M•A•C's global makeup artists are engaging consumers with locally relevant content, as the brand is using more influencers a user generated cost to augment its messaging
We just announced a collaboration with 10 global beauty influencers and bloggers who will create their own M•A•C lipsticks
Our brands' actions to drive earned media value through influencers is working well a win made (17:58) gains in all product categories
As a company, we have tied to the number one position in earned media value share in Total Beauty is measured by Tribe Dynamics, which quantifies the value of digital content created by third parties about a brand
We have the largest corporate share in skin care and fragrances and we have tied for first in makeup
We have Tom Ford, Smashbox and now Too Faced a strongly growing share of engagement with influencers, which is reflected in the higher shares in prestige beauty
In the second quarter M•A•C strongly increased its social influencer engagement, which led to a 30% rise in earned media value
And in another impressive achievement in China, the Estée Lauder brand was ranked number one and the only genius brand in the recent L2 China Beauty Index, which cited the brand leadership in digital marketing, mobile and social media
Now let me turn to outlook
We expect to achieve constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017. This includes approximately 1% of incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of Too Faced
We continue to expect our sales and profits to accelerate in the second half
The stronger gains are expected to come from four main factors, including organic growth, regular price increases that took effect in January, increased consumer coverage tailored by brand and contribution from the recently acquired brands
There are certain brands, channels in countries that we believe will be superior growth engines
They include our luxury brands and the online, travel retail and specialty-multi channels
By market, we expect China to remain strong and Hong Kong should start stabilizing
As we capitalize on the best growth prospects, we are also managing costs and reallocating resources from lower growth area to priority ones, aided by Leading Beauty Forward
We continue to hire talent where we need skill sets and investing capabilities that will position us to win in the fast moving competitive world of global prestige beauty for the long-term
With a diversified business that's directed by proven strategy and powered by multiple engines of growth, which we have strengthened even further with our artisanal fragrances and our recent acquisition of fast-growing makeup brands, we are confident in our long-term outlook
Our results will continue to be fueled by the best brand portfolio and the best people in the industry which will drive our winning strategy and continue our leadership in global prestige beauty
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey
Good morning
Yeah, and just to add one aspect (33:51) that, beyond reducing cost and doing of what Tracey is explained, I believe one of the key benefits in the next two, three years of Leading Beauty Forward, to reallocate resources to the fast-growing opportunity and the fast-growing businesses that we have around the world
So this should further enforce our strengths, on top of creating more cost saving and more margin over the long-term
And I just would like to add one thing on the top-line, which is – yeah, 4% to 5% organic plus acquisition is what we see today
And actually, all what we are doing in terms of action is to improve the ability of all of these elements to grow faster in the future
Meaning the organic is – the good news, there are so many very strong drivers of growth within the current organic travel retail
China gains, stabilization of Hong Kong, continue of online, and they're all accretive in term of margin
So the organic, with the activity that we are doing and with actually – with the decrease of the department store in the U.S
, which is, at this point, the most disappointing performance as part of our portfolio, this part is decreasing as a percentage of business
What is increasing as a percentage of business are all the fast-growing channels and fast-growing activity
So the 4% to 5% can become stronger over time and not weaker, plus the acquisition
Now the acquisitions are doing fantastic
We acquired great brands, both this concept of artisanal high-end fragrances, which as I said in my prepared remarks, altogether growing more than 30% and the new acquisitions like Too Faced, the BECCA which have high growth brand into high growth channels
So the mix of improving our organics with a new change of mix and adapting to the new reality and the strong acquisition actually aims to reinforce our growth potential rather than dilute it
So, no, I frankly disagree that over what's happening on M•A•C is out of our control
There are two things which is happening on M•A•C One, which is a soft traffic in the distribution where M•A•C is present and we need to correct that over time
And so it's kind of in our control
We can correct that
And second, if M•A•C had to make improvements in the social media activity penetration and we are making these improvements
And this is in our control and it's an area that we could do better
We are doing better as I explained and we'll continue to do even better
And the third part is marketing programs
M•A•C quality of collection, quality of innovation will need to improve and continue to improve in the U.S
and we are working on it and some of the things have been already visible in quarter two and more to come in the next quarter
So it's not only a distribution adjustment, it's also a consumer engagement opportunity and also an innovation programs opportunities and we are addressing all of these three
Then I want to add that on M•A•C we are also working on new freestanding store formats that will address the ability to have freestanding store also in lower productivity situation while low tourist traffic because they will be smaller, more connected online, more engaging for consumers and more profitable
And the only thing I would like to add is that in a moment of evolution where consumers are really sensitive to innovation and to trying new products, one of the area of promotion where we are investing more is sampling
And we really are learning more and more how to make samplings very effective, also models that we call paid samplings which are very effective way to do sampling
So we are increasing sampling
And thanks to this, we are increasing the trial level of our new innovations
I will – let me start from the growth
So we see the market 4% to 5%
Our goal – our, say, high-end goal has always been to grow at least 1 point more than market, meaning to continue growing market share
And we are delivering that and we believe we'll continue to deliver that in the long-term
Now to explain the detail of what happened
In reality, we are taking the estimate down 1%
That's what's happening, and we are obviously still deliver 6% to 7% thanks to Too Faced
But there is 1% less expected growth than there were before Too Faced
Now where this comes from and why we believe will accelerate in the second half
This comes from mid-tier department stores in the U.S
that did less than what we expected originally and comes from the Middle East, emerging markets mainly
Middle East, that was really tough, and Turkey
Turkey was a super high growth market for us and a very unfortunate event of the quarter two make Turkey grow much less than what we were expecting
And so this is what was the 1% less
But on the other side, there were many things that continue to do well actually that did even better than what we expected
So for example, the improvements in Asia particularly in China are even better than expected
The trend stabilization of Hong Kong is very good news
The continued success of Korea is really amazing, and this has huge implication for travel retail
Frankly, the super high growth of travel retail, which show how our strategy is working is even better than what we could have anticipated
And the online continue to be very strong
So at the end, the net of this is that many of our engines of growth are getting better and better
Two of the things that took us down in the past, Middle East and Hong Kong are stabilizing, and the issue remains mid-tier department store U.S
where we do not anticipate a lot of improvements in this quarter, and that's what is the result
Of our estimate, you need to add to this that our acquisitions are very strong and they could do very well and even better, and so that's the other element of strength that we are adding to the second semester in our ability to deliver our goals
Now, Tracey, on the EPS?
So probably I could (52:06) start and say our absolute advertising spending is going to be more or less stable across the year and will be – is assumed to be a bit stronger actually in the second six months, so in the six months we have in front of us, particularly in the third quarter because of innovation launches and activities
In terms of percentage of sales, so we'll slightly down in the year and this percentage is driven also by mix, meaning our advertised – or more advertised brands, I should say our traditionally advertised brands are becoming a lower percentage of our total business and our brands which are supported by different tools from social media to sampling and to others like in store activities are becoming a bigger percentage of the business
Because of that, you should assume an overall stability for the next months of our absolute investment, and a slight reduction of percentage of sales
In gross margin, Tracey, you want to comment on that?
So on the first question, the answer is yes
The evolution of our channel mix is accretive
But not only to margin, it's also accretive to growth potential, because we are swinging a bigger percentage of our business into higher growth channels, from what we see
So there is a positive margin and positive growth
And to your point, to your second question, I think – I believe I already explained
The key thing is that the key area of acceleration are pricing
We had pricing in January, which had about 2 points of acceleration
We had a lot of new – particularly for new brands – new distribution opportunities which are planned to start being impacting the business in the second semester, and there are 2, 3 points that will come out of new distribution
And this new distribution, I do mean – new distribution, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone in new countries, new cities
So it's not cannibalizing distribution, it's really coverage of consumer
That's why we call it consumer coverage opportunities
Plus, this includes some of the mix acceleration, meaning the moment Estée Lauder brand successfully built doors in ULTA, and they were very well, these automatically create more distribution which grows better
So there is more of this in the second semester
Then there is strong organic growth, the innovation that is working, as we have explained our prepared remark, will now continue to impact and grow in multiple areas
I believe the good news is that skin care is growing again and is adding this engine – and the other good news is that the engine we just created with these fragrances – high-end fragrances – continue to grow (57:51) very well, and we continue to accelerate growth on a higher base
Plus, as I explained, Middle East and Hong Kong , they've been two negatives in the first six months, should be better in the second six months
And finally, the base is lower, frankly, particularly in quarter four
The base is lower, and so we believe that the combination of these things will bring our organic growth to the level that we are estimating
On top of that, the new acquisitions, Too Faced and BECCA, are doing very well, so – and we believe they will add the very significant sense of comfort to the ability to deliver the right growth, and by the way, this will continue into next fiscal year
And going back to the first part of the question is, yeah, we came at the low end of the guidance, but the guidance has a high end and a low end, so I would now conclude is that we have issues forecasting
The issue is the one I explained
The issue is that versus our competition
We are absolutely overexposed to mid-tier department stores in the U.S
particularly
And this very high exposure and we have been obviously hit harder than others on the soft traffic that this channel has experienced in the last year
And that's why we are trying to react to
We are trying to continue to diversify our business globally in order to be able not to be over-dependent by any channel, any country, any brand
And to have such a well diversified portfolio that we can deliver our 1 point ahead of market or more growth independently from any other area of the business or any specific area of the business
So frankly I'm very proud how we are pivoting the company in terms of online, TR, specialty-multi distribution, how we are pivoting the company in terms of social media versus historical or traditional way to engage the consumers, how we are pivoting the company to penetrate the makeup boom in a very aggressive way, how we are pivoting the company to split up and change our innovation models
We are pivoting and we are pivoting while continue to be one of the fastest growth companies in the consumer industry
I personally am very proud of my team in the way we are managing this
although we do recognize that we were at the low end of our estimate and we are overexposed to the soft and usual mid-tier department store in the U.S
