Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone
Our new fiscal year is off to a terrific start
We delivered an outstanding financial performance in the first quarter, powered by multiple engines of growth across our business
Both sales and earnings per share rose double-digits, and all of our regions and major categories advanced
Our 13% constant currency sales increase exceeded our forecast, and we leveraged the incremental top line results into excellent earnings growth, aided by cost savings and efficiencies
We accelerated the momentum that we experienced at the end of fiscal year 2017 by continuing to focus on fast growing brands, channels, and countries, and fueled these areas with additional resources and investments
We targeted new consumers as we expanded our reach, especially with millennials, and they were drawn to our innovative, high-quality products
More influencers' attention, sophisticated social media programs and a digital-first mindset across our brands helped drive our success
With an encouraging start to the year and continued confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our full-year sales and EPS guidance
In constant currency, we now expect our sales to rise 8% to 9% and earnings per share growth of 12% to 14% in fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are mindful of external geopolitical and economic issues that could pose challenges to our business
Looking out our categories, makeup has been strong for several years and continued to be robust across many of our brands
Too Faced and BECCA contributed significantly along with Tom Ford and Estée Lauder
What stood out in this quarter, however, was our skin care performance which rebounded strongly, a trend we are seeing in the industry
Our improvement stemmed from strength in existing products and successful recent launches from Estée Lauder, La Mer, and GLAMGLOW, as they captured many new consumers
Our fragrance categories growth came largely from our luxury and our artisanal brands, which are gaining traction worldwide and have developed into a strong growth engine
Nearly all brands in our portfolio advanced globally
Our flagship Estée Lauder brand generated double-digit global growth with positive results in every region, led by particular strengths from Chinese consumers and global travelers
Aligned with the company's strategy, Estée Lauder has developed multiple engines of growth across its categories, channels, and geographies
Much of the brand's momentum stemmed from an acceleration in skin care on top of continuous strength in makeup
This was reflected in the success of these powerful hero franchises, including the Advanced Night Repair and Re-Nutriv skin care collections and Double Wear and Pure Color makeup lines
This marks Estée Lauder's fourth consecutive quarter of solid sales growth, in the last two quarters, up double-digits
Our M·A·C brand grew modestly on a global basis, thanks to excellent gains in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, where its business more than doubled
Growth also came from travel retail, where its sales climbed double-digits
M·A·C has successfully captured new consumers, helping to deliver sequential improvements also in North America
Our luxury brands continued to enjoy strong worldwide demand
La Mer, Jo Malone, Tom Ford each grew double-digits in every region
And our newness brand are performing well, and we build their equities and broaden their reach to a targeted consumer base
To stay in the lead in prestige beauty, we continued to successfully pivot to the high-growth channels, where more consumers are shopping
Our sales in travel retail, specialty-multi and online each grew strong double-digits
Sales gains in travel retail reflected higher passenger traffic, a greater number of Chinese travelers to Hong Kong and Macau, compelling offering and a wider exposure of some of mid-sized brands
All of our brands benefited from the positive trend
Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and La Mer were standouts while most of the portfolio had healthy gains, including Clinique, which rose sharply on strong demand for its moisturizers
All regions grew in travel retail
Asia/Pacific led the growth with Chinese consumer traveling in greater numbers within Asia as well as to key tourist destinations in Europe
We continued rolling out some of our newer brands in major airports, including By Kilian or Le Labo
For the fiscal year, we expect our travel retail business to remain robust based on expected strong passenger traffic growth, increased conversion of travelers into buyers and sustained demand for our products, particularly from emerging market consumers
We plan to invest more in China and other emerging markets this fiscal year to further build awareness and demand for our brands
We should benefit consumption in both the local market and several travel corridors
Our strong online business was led by third-party and retailer sites
Globally, our metrics improved across the board, including higher traffic, conversions, and orders
We continued to garner new consumers throughout our business on Tmall in China, where our sales more than doubled, fueled in part by M·A·C's successful launch in May
In the recent quarter, M·A·C also successfully launched on a large online platform in Southeast Asia owned by Alibaba called Lazada with a brand building distribution model similar to Tmall, where we control the look and the content of the virtual store
We expect to expand on the platform in more markets and with more brands starting this quarter
We continue to broaden our global online footprint with new site launches and retailer distribution expansion
In the quarter, we added more than 100 sites
The majority were retailers and most of them in the European region, demonstrating the scalability of our digital model
Spurred by the growth of social media and technology advancement, mobile is the focus of our digital strategies
In the recent quarter, mobile accounted for 70% of our global online traffic
We are seeing the results of our investment in mobile, as it is an important factor driving first time digital consumers in emerging markets and increasing the frequency of purchases in more developed countries
We also continue to strengthen our position in specialty-multi retailers globally
Many of our brands expanded their target reach as they pushed younger consumers drawn by the channel
M·A·C roll out in ULTA Beauty in North America has resonated strongly, as approximately half the consumer who purchased M·A·C products were new or lapsed users of the brand
M·A·C has become a best-selling makeup brand in the large majority of ULTA Beauty stores where it opened
And based on the strong initial performance, we plan to accelerate its expansion there
By opening in more specialty-multi stores globally, M·A·C will continue to balance a meaningful presence in all major channels, department stores, freestanding stores, specialty-multi, online, and travel retail
Internationally, we are strategically expanding our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, in the specialty-multi channel which is their primary distribution focus
We have entered certain European markets through Sephora and other retailers and are highly ranked
Several brands are actively expanding in specialty-multi in Korea where sales has been excellent
For example, Clinique and Origins each added more than 50 doors of Olive Young
Turning to our geographies, our sales in China soared
Virtually all our brands there grew double-digits, while some, notably M·A·C, Tom Ford, and Lab Series, more than doubled
Our makeup business in total doubled for the second consecutive quarter while skin care accelerated
Our luxury fragrance brands also performed beautiful
Our brands have strengthened our position with Chinese consumers, and our analytics show that much of this growth is coming from consumers new to our brands
Our retail sales accelerated sequentially from last quarter, and importantly, we gained share
The surge in consumption for luxury beauty in China is due in part to stronger demand from millennials in lower prices as a result of import tax reductions which have given consumers more purchasing power
We foresee continued strong interest in luxury products by Chinese consumers and plan to continue investing in the country
Hong Kong delivered strong gains as tourist traffic increased and local demand improved, contributing to increases across categories
More investment in digital and social media helped drive awareness
We have been strengthening the portfolio of our newness brand by providing R&D and supply chain capabilities
We are also identifying new distribution opportunities where we see strong consumer interest
As a result, we launched several of our new luxury fragrance brands in European flagship department stores that have significant tourist traffic
In the U.S
, we are committed to collaborating with department stores to drive growth both in store and online by exciting consumers with product innovation and better services
This quarter, our sales from many of the stores' online sites were robust, and although our business in brick-and-mortar continued to be challenged, we saw early signs of progress
We are encouraged that our organic sales in North America department stores showed sequential improvement for the quarter, despite the impact of hurricanes that affected our business for several weeks in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico
This speaks to the breadth and strength of our portfolio, as well to our channel mix
On a more personal level, we are proud of the work that the company has done to help our affected employees and their families in the areas disrupted by the storms
Fueling our success across channels and geographies was an array of exciting products that captivated consumers
We continue to focus our innovation on our biggest franchises, striving to make our hero products in every brand even more valuable, introducing new products with an important franchise brings it more attention and increases sales across the key areas of our business
Through effective social media, our brands are inspiring more trial of core product lines, which more often lead to repeat purchases and brand loyalty
For example, Estée Lauder introduced a new eye serum under Advanced Night Repair line, the ANR Eye Concentrate Matrix
It was highly successful worldwide and helped drive sales of the entire franchise
Likewise, Clinique newest Moisture Surge product, a supercharged concentrate, boosted the collection and created the halo effect on the moisturizer's sub-category, which is a strategic focus area for Clinique
Moisture Surge sales have increased significantly for the last two years globally and, in the recent quarter, rose more than 30% as retail in the U.S
Clinique plans to bolster the Moisture Surge franchise with additional products
As we promote our wide array of beauty products, we are focusing our marketing spending on digital to allow how consumers are seeking communications and information
Each of our brands has adopted a digital-first mind-set with an emphasis on mobile
With a tailored approach, each brand continuously decide which platforms and messages are most effective in reaching their target consumers
Another important piece of our digital strategy is social media, especially the use of influencers, who have proven to help our brands standout
The Estée Lauder brand recently named a new global beauty director, who is attracting younger consumer and collaborating on product development
Clinique uses hundreds of local influencers all over the world, who promote its products in culturally-relevant ways
Clinique China business was solid this quarter, due in part to improved consumer engagement
Looking to the holiday season, we believe our compelling programs will drive traffic to stores and support our overall business
Clinique has developed desirable sets that will be competitively positioned, while M·A·C's Snow Ball collection reflects current fashion trends
We continue to invest in capabilities and talent
Our performance is the reflection of our terrific teams across the globe who were able to quickly pivot and execute change smoothly
We continuously developed our bench strength to ensure that our business leaders are in the best positions to perform with excellence and advance our strategies
Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is enabling us to cut expenses, become more efficient, and create great leverage of our sales growth
This will allow us to invest more in best growth opportunities by also expanding our operating margin
We are maintaining some flexibility to allocate further resources to our biggest opportunities with the potential to spur momentum
We plan to devote greater resources to our strongest growth engines; China, global digital commerce, product innovation, and travel retail, to advance our industry leadership and sustain our growth above global prestige beauty
We are gratified to be starting this fiscal year on such a high note, which is a testament to our winning strategy, to the agility of our talent and to our execution capability
We are optimistic about our future and excited about the global opportunities that lies ahead while remaining mindful of potential macro risks
Now I will turn the call over to Tracey
Thank you
Wow, this is one question
But yes, basically, prestige market we believe will continue to grow 4% to 5%
In this moment, it's pretty solid
The drivers of the global prestige market, frankly, are not changing, and they are the higher consumption of prestige from the millennial consumers
The higher access to luxury and prestige businesses in emerging markets, particularly in China
And the continuous – the higher level of usage, particularly on makeup, of the millennial consumers versus previous generations
The recent improvements of the trend is in skin care where the millennials are also entering more than skin care business
Now what is the consequence of us of this is frankly a better balance of the growth between makeup and skin care is favorable to us because our skin care margins are better than the overall makeup margins, but I want still to remind that, within makeup, there are certain categories like face or foundation, which are also very profitably like many other skin care categories
So it's a very good positive
In term of the impact of this trend on Too Faced and BECCA, makeup is growing
Now the new news is the acceleration of skin care
Frankly, I don't see any big issue with deceleration of makeup, also because makeup continues to grow internationally in a very strong way, and we are, in fact, deploying Too Faced and BECCA more internationally
So what is our expectation for Too Faced and BECCA? Obviously, after we have finished to add them – when we will add them in the base, we plan to continue growing this brand double-digit and, as part of this, the internationalization of these two brands will be an important step
And I just want to underline the point that we are working very closely to our department store partners to look for accelerating and finding a better way to attract higher traffics also in the brick-and-mortar malls – stores, and we see some promising signs that some of the activity we are testing and learning about has a stronger effect on consumers than what we have done in the last couple of years
So we will keep focusing on that
But to Tracey's point is the balance (34:30) is being where the consumer is
And I want to underline where the consumer is, is more and more online
And so our strength online including our strength online with our department store partners is a big part of this mitigating impact of the change of traffic in the country
No, GLAMGLOW is doing extremely well
It's continued to grow in the U.S
and is expanding internationally, is, in this moment, very successful in the U.K
, for example, and is expanding in other markets
The target that we are hitting is the younger consumer
So millennials really like GLAMGLOW
The strength of the GLAMGLOW, in this moment, skin care proposition, are several, but two standouts in my opinion
One is that the glow overall promise of the entire brand, the benefit of glowing skin is one of the most desirable benefits in the market in this moment and, importantly, is the most desirable benefit for younger skins, which is behind a lot of the growth we are seeing in skin care around the world, which is driven by that target group
The second strength is the fact that this brand is focused on masks, and masks is the fastest-growing product category in skin care in this moment in most of the global regions
And third is that this brand is, as you said in your question, expanding into other categories beyond masks
And every single very careful decision we have taken to expand the category is working and is giving great results
It is coherent from a consumer standpoint
And finally, as I already said, the internationalization of the opportunity
So again, a good acquisition, a good promising start of the acceleration of this brand, and a lot still do to in the next years to make this brand one of our mid-size and then one day very big brands in our portfolio
So our online business is still growing very strong
We were up 33% in quarter one
And our online by now represent about 11% of total sales now globally, but the penetration is much higher than 11% in some of the top markets where online is very strong
We are growing our online business this quarter in general in our estimate for the year
We have growth in our brand dot-com, in our retail dot-com, and in platforms
So all the three segments are growing very strongly
This quarter, particularly brand dot-com remain very strong, but we saw a tremendous acceleration of platforms, namely Tmall
And as we said in the prepared remarks, the beginning of our investment in Lazada in Southeast Asia
And we saw amazing progress in retail dot-com across the world
So growth in department store retail dot-com in the U.S
, growth in the specialty-multi retail dot-com and growth in many retail dot-coms around the world
Actually, the exception is China where in China is now retail dot-com driven but is Tmall driving the growth
So very strong and, as we said also in the prepared remark, clearly scalable
We have opened 100 sites just this quarter in a very efficient way, scalable and agile, meaning where we see it works, we can invest more
Where it doesn't work, we can smoothly change and revise and review what we're doing
On the other two questions, so the short answer, and then I'll give you more detail, is that we believe that a double-digit growth is sustainable
Now, the 50%, 40% are – may happen again by quarter depending on volatility, but I could not define (47:17) them as sustainable model, obviously
The double-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in retail over the long run should be sustainable trends
Let me go one by one
In China, we are seeing, in this moment, an amazing results, but also in like-door we have 33%
And that's super strong, we are growing market share
And interesting, this quarter we saw these amazing results without increasing the number of cities, but just increasing the number of doors in the cities where we need to be more penetrated, where we need to put more brands
So it's about more establishing our strengths rather than further expanding the number of cities this quarter, which, again, shows the power of online in city – in China, where the cities where we're not expanding brick-and-mortar yet, because it's not yet efficient, we still can reach the city with online
So the model is pretty interesting, pretty sustainable, and has power
The second thing I would like to say on China, the market continued to grow
So we are growing above the market and building market share, but the market was about 30% growth, so very strong
It's about new consumer
It's about new access, as I said in my prepared remarks
The other important thing in China is we are growing in every single channel in China: department stores, Sephora, freestanding stores, online
They're all growing double-digits
So there is a really well spread
And then in every brand in our portfolio, we are growing
We are growing in makeup
We are growing in skin care
We are growing in fragrance
So it's broad growth, and so it's sustainable, in our opinion, on a more or less double-digit trend
On travel retail, travel retail has been very strong
We have seen this quarter an acceleration of travel retail in the retail – at retail levels, so a retail acceleration
And this is driven by trends which are sustainable, some trends are the market, meaning the traffic of travelers is very solid
But a lot of what's happened is driven by us
One is about conversion, meaning today we estimate that 15%, depending on airport region, of people entering in airport shop anything
So it's just driving the conversion from travelers to shoppers is an enormous opportunity to continuous traffic growth, and this isn't the end of the brands because this has a lot to do with investments we do in the current (49:45) or in the market of all regions
So the fact that we are investing more in China, we are investing more in Brazil, we are investing more in Russia, et cetera, this is the reason why our countries in travel retail is working better and better, because our conversion in travel retail thanks to the marketing work that our teams do in every one of these countries is working better and better thanks to the assortment we choose in these places is getting better and better
So it's not only about traffic, it's about what we do and what we invest in every single country
And that's why we believe that this is sustainable of more or less a double-digit trend in the long term
The other reason why it's sustainable is very broad
As I explained, it's not only Asia
We grew in travel retail in EMEA, in Latin America, in the U.S
Obviously Asia has been particularly strong, but it's broad-based the growth that we see in this moment
And we have developed a strategy where we really can follow the consumer across traveling corridors, and we can make sure also our innovation speaks to them in a coherent way between current country or regions (50:56) where they travel
And so, in summary, strong and sustainable, but not at the levels we have seen this quarter
Skin care – and now, Tracey, please add any perspectives
Skin care has strong margins structurally in our business
However, when there is a beat of skin care sales where the extra skin care sales versus our original forecast comes without a lot of expenses, this margin gets boosted in the short term
So I will not consider the quarter one margins as sustainable, but definitely we can count on stronger than average skin care margins in the future for the growth of skin care
And in terms of millennials, the millennials are obviously getting more and more in skin care in what I define in summary, instant benefits
Before I was speaking about GLAMGLOW and the glow benefit, there are other benefits which are instant, which is about preparing the skin for makeup, is about benefits for the day
So not only traditional anti-aging but instant benefit for the skin are very popular with millennials around the world, and this will continue also because we are driving it and, frankly, the industry is driving that
So I believe this can be an interesting medium-term trend
Tracey?
No, frankly, this is the number that we see, we estimate for the year
Now, could be more 5% than 4%, absolutely, this first quarter was very solid
But you need to look at the – this is a global estimate
Now the retail in the U.S
is not super strong
The retail in Continental Europe is not super strong
is softening in term of market
The Latin America market is not super strong
So what you see today is actually an acceleration in Asia, absolutely
But you don't see in terms of total market every single region accelerated
So in total, with plus and minus, we still believe a 4% to 5%, probably more in the 5% area is what we see today
Which bring me to the second point that is, yes, we – I cannot speak for our competitors but from the number I see, I would agree with you, the big three are strong and are delivering market share growth overall, and we definitely are
We are growing market share in a significant way
And I think this is explainable in many ways but one way maybe I want to add as far Estée Lauder Company are concerned
The big amount of the small brands and new launches, innovation that's happening in the market has created a much more competitive trial environment, meaning consumer buying new products, try new products, being able to access many more new products
But repurchase is continued to be driven by high-quality products at brand they trust
So while the trial game is more competitive, the repurchase game is still in the hands of the hero franchises, the big brands, and these brands continue to deliver very strong repurchase
Remember, a lot of the profitability is in repurchase because trial, most of the time, is an investment
And so what you see is the power of product quality, the power of prestige experiences into play, and that in this very competitive market out there, still strong brands, great quality products, and fundamental superior experiences remain the reason for success
So M·A·C North America, specifically, as we said, is continuing to decline in the brick-and-mortar part of the business, meaning the department stores and our freestanding stores, and had a tremendous acceleration online and is performing very well in ULTA – in the store of ULTA as we had explained
So that's the mix
So in total, there is a sequential improvement of the trend of the brand
Also, the innovation of M·A·C is planned to improve gradually across the fiscal year to be more in tune for the key trends in the United States of what has been in the past
So our expectation is that the brands, in total, will stabilize over time thanks to the distribution balance, the drive of online, the improved innovation program, and having then in the base the periods that the brand had in the last year
So this gradually will put the brand in a condition to stabilize and then in the longer term grow again
As I said, in many other markets of the world, the brand is flying, and in China even doubling
So, in total, we continue to expect the brand to have the power to grow
But in North America, this will take a little bit of time to stabilize
