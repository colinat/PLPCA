Good morning, everyone
The first quarter was certainly a challenging one for Kellogg North America
We again delivered strong operating profit margin expansion
However, our top-line was not where we wanted it to be
John has already walked you through the unexpectedly soft consumption that was felt across our categories and across the entire industry
And, as he said, it appears that at least some of this was due to transitory factors that will not persist
We also had a notable decrease in trade inventories
We knew that trade inventory would come out in Q1 and it did
During the quarter, we made good progress on productivity initiatives, investment in food and packaging and our DSD transition, which I'll come back to in a moment
And we had strong commercial plans across our businesses for Q2 and the second half, though I'm confident that our sales performance will improve
Let's briefly walk through each business, starting with the ones whose results came in largely as expected, and then moving to Morning Foods and Snacks, where the factors I mentioned were most acute
I'll start with Specialty Channels on slide 13. Our Specialty Channels business in Q1 delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth, even against a tough year-ago comparison
The net sales growth was delivered through equal parts of volume and price/mix, and via market expansion in core channels, as well as expansion in emerging growth channels, all of which was aided by innovation
Operating profit margin continued to improve, driven by price, mix, as well as continued Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting savings
So we continue to feel good about Specialty Channels
Now we'll look at our North America Other segment on slide number 14. As we expected, this segment posted strong 8% profit growth in Q1 with margins improving substantially, up 200 basis points on the strength of Project K and ZBB savings
In Frozen, Eggo consumption returned to growth in March
With the removal of artificial ingredients and solid commercial plans, we expect better net sales performance in coming quarters
MorningStar Farms is a similar story
Consumption turned to growth in March and our renovated line is now on shelf and being supported
So that should get gradually better, too
At Kashi, trade inventory corrected, following innovation launches in late Q4. However, we continue to show good progress in our overhauled Cereal business, which continued to grow consumption in the natural channel and grew consumption in xAOC measured channels, too, with particularly encouraging gains for our bear naked brand
And we're just starting to get back on air with media
We launched our new Nut Butter Bars in January
Our early signs are good and we're following it up with further renovations and innovations in the second half
So Kashi is another business in which we expect to see gradual improvement as the year goes on, both in consumption and in net sales
In Canada, we're still seeing the volume impact of our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover the steep transactional FX impact of a weakened Canadian dollar
We expect the impact to stabilize as we lap our pricing actions in the next couple of months
So Canada is on track to meet expectations for the year
Now, let's turn to slide 15 and U.S
Morning Foods
Morning Foods' Q1 sales were affected by the category-wide consumption slowdowns in January and February, by trade inventory reductions coming out of Q4 and by the timing of our commercial plans
Performance across our core six brands was mixed
Our kid brands grew consumption and share behind a strong performance of Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops
Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the leading category innovation this year, and Froot Loops responded very well to its new Whatever Froots Your Loops campaign
On the flipside, Special K and Mini-Wheats started the year in decline, largely due to the year-on-year timing of innovation and renovation
Last year, both had important activity in Q1. While this year, both are set to launch new and renovated offerings during Q2. We expect quarterly sequential improvement in sales for cereal and share, driven by continued momentum in our kid brands and by the renovation, innovation, and new communication for the Special K and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, which are breaking here in the month of May
We also have a major in-store event coming in late Q2 behind the movie release of Despicable Me 3. Pop-Tarts in Q1 continued to gain share in toaster pastries, driven by the successful launch of new Pop-Tarts Dunkin' Donuts flavors
We'll continue to drive this brand hard in the back half of the year with the launch of JOLLY RANCHER-flavored Pop-Tarts
So we expect gradual improvement in Morning Foods' sales performance in the coming quarters, while OP margin expansion will continue
Now, let's talk about U.S
Snacks shown on slide number 16. Snacks had a tough quarter for the consumption and trade inventory reasons we've mentioned previously
Additionally, but not unexpectedly, we also experienced some initial order softness during the few weeks in February when we were informing our DSD employees of our exit
These factors combined to pull down net sales and operating profit in the quarter
The good news is that we continue to gain share in Crackers, led by our Big 3 brands
And we saw newly-supported Keebler gain share in Cookies
We also sustained share growth momentum in another focused brand for us, Rice Krispies Treats
So our underlying in-market business performance remains healthy
And we feel good about what's coming in our commercial plans for the rest of the year
We've already launched Special K Snacks in Q1 and still transitioning that on shelf, but that will help us stabilize that brand
As we transition out of DSD, we are ramping up brand-building support across key cracker brands, wholesome snack brands, and Pringles
Q2 will see support behind our innovations as well as in-store promotions around Major League Soccer and the tie-in to the movie, Despicable Me 3. And going into the second half, our plan strengthens further with innovations behind Cheez-It, the renovation of Nutri-Grain and new single-serve pack-form adds across multiple categories, all of this supported by the incremental brand-building that is a key element of our transition to our new Go-to-Market Model
This brings me to another important development in the quarter, our progress against the DSD transition
This is graphically depicted on slide number 16 (sic) [17]
Transition planning is well underway, driven by a multi-functional team and led by individuals that orchestrated our successful integration of Pringles
Joint business planning with customers has gone well
And our retention of employees is on track
And we've made numerous other elements of progress against a host of operational elements
So we feel very good about our progress so far
Portfolio optimization began in Q1 and will continue through the transition as we optimize the assortment for warehouse delivery and work down inventories
This will have an increasing impact on volume as the year goes on, but it facilitates the transitions this year and should contribute to a net improvement in velocity and profitability as we get into 2018. Customer transitions have begun, with the first of our customer base being converted here in Q2. This will trigger the first of the list price adjustments, which will have an increasing impact as more customers get converted across Q2 and Q3. Keep in mind that we already have a fully-functioning warehouse system that is both efficient and scalable and is ready for this transition
Remember, though, most of DSD network will have to remain open through the transition
The final exit, including the final head count and DC reductions, will happen as the last of the customers gets converted during Q4. That's when you will see the true benefit of the savings begin to come forward at their ultimate run rate
So in summary for Kellogg North America, our top-line performance across the region was affected by softened consumption across most categories in the U.S
, as well as some shipment timing and some short-term issues that should be behind us
Commercial plans get stronger in Q2, and we are making good progress on the DSD transition
And we continue to deliver strong improvement in our operating profit margin
With that, I'll turn it back to John for a look at the international regions
Hey, Rob, Paul
Yeah, Kashi
I will come to Kashi in a second
If you look across Crackers, Cookies, Pop-Tarts, Cereal, Frozen, and Kashi, consumption was higher than our shipments in every case
Okay? So it really was a significant impact
Again, more granular on something like Kashi, there's a big disconnect in cereal, in particular, partly because of the selling in of innovation at the end of last year, which we knew drove some inventory in
The good news is, is the consumption is exactly where, if not ahead of where we planned
So we're seeing that come through in the first quarter and will normalize now as we go forward into the second quarter
I want to dig deeper and give you a little bit of color maybe on Snacks
Snacks was off, as you can see, by about 6%
Half of that, we think, is consumption-related broad-based trends in the marketplace
As I said, we grew share in Crackers
We grew share in the Keebler Cookie brand
Rice Krispies continues to do well
But the other half is things like the inventory decline, so planned SKU culls and a little bit of disruption around the, as John said, the transition as it relates to ordering, particularly in those two weeks when we spoke to our sales force about the future
So you can see this disconnect come through just about in every one of our businesses, it gives us the belief it's transitory and things will get better
Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you
Here's how we see the status of the DSD transition
So far, everything is on track
And we're very happy with where we stand
If you step back, remember, what's driving this is a consumer and shopper-driven reason and a customer channel-driven reason
Part of the orientation away to a pull model is that we will shift significant resources to brand-building behind those, what I would call, invest-to-grow brands, particularly within Snacks, brands like Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, for example
Our warehouse model is more effective and efficient
We already ship through warehouses
We deliver better service and higher in-stocks and it offers us better joint value creation with our customers as we come through on one platform
As far as the shelf is concerned, we're deliberately leaning in to optimize our assortment, so we can make the shelf work harder
And so we are looking proactively to make sure that we have our fastest moving, biggest brands, where the investment is going to go, on shelf
We're not looking to lose space
We're looking to optimize our shelf so it can work harder
Within our customer discussions, so far, there is broad-based agreement that this is the future of delivery in these kinds of categories
And we're working through how we achieve it in the near-term
So we've had generally very good support for the move
Specifically on brand-building, as I alluded to, you will see the brand-building ramp up here as we go through Q2, Q3, and Q4. It is really important as we go through this transition that we have strong plans in market to ensure shelf presence, display presence and we've got big things to sell behind
So as you look at our Snacks business year to go, we do have a double-digit increase in brand-building coming on crackers, wholesome snacks and Pringles
We have renovation of the core Nutri-Grain business and brand
We have a big range of seasonal innovations across cookies and wholesome that will drive fun and excitement and display in store
We have Cheez-It innovation coming in the back half
And we have lots of new pack formats across crackers, cookies, and wholesome snacks to drive incremental consumption in new occasions
And a lot of those packs will exist in the mainstream retail environment as well
So we have a pretty packed program of things to come that will drive excitement in the category and we'll benefit from the brand-building as we put it in in the back half of the year
I can't give you a quantification today, David
But what you're saying is what we're doing
We are eliminating tail where it doesn't make sense
And we're looking to prioritize and maximize assortment against the biggest things we have
And so when I talk about putting more brand-building in behind brands like Cheez-Its and Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera, we are making sure that we have the most efficient and effective assortment to drive our business harder going forward
But there is a degree of SKU rationalization, and we've leant in proactively on that
Hey, Josh, I can't go into detail on price or anything that you call the give-backs
But I can tell you that the discussions with retailers have gone well
And within the context of the plans we put together going in, so far so good
Yes, Josh, I think it would be fair to say there is always pressure from our retail partners to keep prices low
If you look at the data we see, you see there's not a lot of massive deflation going on in our categories right now
We have seen a little bit of push from private labels in selected categories
Frozen would be one
We've see private label items come up, and we've also seen our Eggo items come up, which suggests that there are factors going on there
And the retail environment is changing to adapt to consumer needs, quite frankly
And so we're seeing growth on the fringes of retail in all kinds of places, just incumbent on us to be more agile with the right food in the right format at the right price, depending on those retail environments
But the pressure is the same as it's always been
Yes, we see the improvement coming sequentially across the year
A far as the Snacks business is concerned, obviously, I'm not sure we'll see incremental volume or price pressure, as John alluded to
As part of the transition, our retailers will actually get more margin here
And we have great plans to pull coming through in brand-building
So we will see some deflation of pricing because of the net sales impact, but overall underlying velocities, there's going to be a lot of volatility
But we're still going to execute our plan
I think some of that 50% or so, half of it being consumption decline, was related to the January, February impacts that I think the entire industry felt
We're not anticipating those declines to become the norm
I think they were transitory in nature
And so we feel very confident that snacking categories are ripe for growth going forward
Specifically to Kashi Snacks, we launched two Nut Butter Bars at the beginning of the year here, and so far so good
The pickup has been better than we expected
We have more listings to come in the back half around nut butters
We're also fully renovating our chewy bars here at the end of the second quarter, moving into the third quarter, and the food is significantly preferred, so we have a real upgrade coming on our chewy bars
So that's the innovation and renovation
We've just gone back on air with new advertising which features the bars here in March, April, so
And that will continue through Q2 and Q3. So we are on track to deliver what we expected this year
Now as we've said, on Kashi bars in particular, we expected growth on cereal this year from a consumption point of view
That is our outlook
On bars, we expected to dramatically decline the rate of decline, if you like
So we're not expecting growth, but we are expecting a much lower rate of decline, in the single digits
And so far, we're on track and we feel good with the uptake of these new bars
In terms of points of distribution on bars, we are seeing going into the second half of the year, a stabilization as it pertains to points of distribution, which is positive because we hadn't seen that over the past couple of years
So with a bit of luck and a bit of hope and a bit of good execution, we're bottoming out here and we can start to look forward on snacks
Specifically to Kashi, Michael, or to the
Granted, we expect it to come across all of our businesses, as I mentioned, that we see consumption disconnected from shipments in just about every category
So we expect improving consumption on cereal through the back half of the year
We expect it on cookies and crackers from a velocity point of view, Pop-Tarts
Frozen, we're anticipating getting back into growth
Kashi Cereal, we're looking to see that consumption growth come through in our business
Specialty, we expect to maintain the momentum we've developed
And in our Canadian business, we're going to lap, as I said, the pricing interventions from a year ago soon, and we expect an improving performance there as well
So it really is broad-based
We don't give quarterly indications, but we have factored in, obviously, a degree of an inventory build and a transfer here through the second and third quarter, which will be offset by some other factors as the year goes on
So as John, I think, might pick it up, we'd originally factored in the impact to the company in the year from this
It's Paul, David
The Special K Cereal business has actually flattened out pretty much and held or grown share in the last two years
The impact in Q1 was really down to a timing of innovation activity, and we have all of that lined up to start and it's starting here in May, as we speak
So the Cereal business, you picked it up
If we're going to win and drive this category forward, our Core 6 needs to fire on all cylinders
And K needs to do better in the back half
We think we have the plans to do that
Our kid brands momentum will continue, specifically with wholesome snacks
There's more than Special K to wholesome snacks
Rice Krispies Treats continues to grow, and we look to accelerate that
Nutri-Grain has significant renovation coming as well
And then the Special K transition is underway, with better food and we'll benefit from the new campaign across the entire brand
So we expect an improving trend in Special K bars as part of our wholesome snack business year to go
