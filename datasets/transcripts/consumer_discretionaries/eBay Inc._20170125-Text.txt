Thanks Devin
Let’s begin with Q4, performance starting on Slide 4, of the earnings presentation
In Q4, we generated $2.4 billion of total revenue, $0.54 of non-GAAP EPS, $484 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $1 billion of our stock
Let’s start with Q4 active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was 3% year-over-year resulting in 2 million more active buyers
The underlying cohort dynamics show retained buyers at consistent positive growth driven by stable churn rates
Our re-activated buyers have also grown at a rate similar to prior quarters
And new buyer growth, while still negative is starting to see more favorable trends in the last few months
On Slide 6 in Q4, we enabled $22.3 billion of GMV, up 5%
By geography, the U.S
generated $9.1 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $13.2 billion of GMV, up 7% year-over-year
Moving to revenue, we generated net revenues of $2.4 billion, up 6% decelerating 2 points sequentially driven by 1 point of lapping last quarters VAT settlement and 1 point of lapping strong growth at StubHub last year
We delivered $1.9 billion of transaction revenue, up 6% and $519 million of MS, marketing services and other revenue, up 5%
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 8, Q4 GMV grew 5% accelerating 1 point versus Q3. U.S
GMV accelerated 2 points quarter-over-quarter to 3% and international GMV continued growing at 7%, both benefiting from a strong finish to our holiday season
And as Devin discussed improvements in mobile, C2C, and structured data
More specifically on structured data, we have processed 55% of relevant listings to date, while the total base of listings has grown 40% over the same time period
We have created 180 million structured data enabled pages, that are being surfaced through SCO which further accelerated in Q4, and now through organic channels
Total Marketplace revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration versus prior quarter
Transaction revenue grew 5%, inline with GMV and there was minimal impact to transaction revenue from promotional spend classified as contra
Marketing services and other revenue declined 1%, decelerating 6 points versus Q3, driven by a full quarter of comps from the PayPal operating agreement revenue as well as the shift from our advertising business from off-eBay ads to on-eBay ads
As a reminder, the PayPal operating agreement contributed roughly 1 point of growth to total revenue in 2016 and this will continue to be a headwind in the first half of 2017. For the full-year the marketplace platform generated $79 billion of GMV up 5% and $7.2 billion in revenue up 4%
Moving to Slide 9, StubHub GMV grew 5% decelerating 18 points from Q3 as we lapped the full quarter of the pricing display and product changes from 2015. In addition, we face some headwinds from a weaker event landscape in December
StubHub revenue grew 20% down 12 points versus Q3 driven by volume offset by revenue from the TicketbiS acquisition
In 2016 StubHub grew GMV 21% to $4.3 billion and increased revenue 30% to $944 million
Moving to Slide 10. In Q4, Classifieds had another double-digit quarter, growing revenue 13% year-over-year
Growth in the automotive and real estate verticals in key markets, strength in engagement metrics and improvement in mobile apps continue to aid Classifieds despite lower advertising monetization from the ongoing traffic shift to mobile apps
Our Classifieds platform continues to innovate and to serve the 250 million monthly unique visitors that come to our site, across 11 brands in 15 countries
For the full-year Classifieds generated $791 million of revenue up 15%
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers, in Q4 we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31.9%, which is down 250 basis points versus last year
dollar negatively impacted margin by 170 basis points and was felt across all spend categories
So I’ll focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses
Cost of revenue increased year-over-year driven by technology infrastructure investments related to growth in product and engineering
Q4 sales and marketing expense was down slightly in total as productivity, was partially offset by reallocations across channels and platforms to help fund our marketplace brand advertising efforts
As we have previously mentioned, we will continue to be disciplined about our marketing investments and we will optimize across all our channels to get the most efficient ROI, whether those channels are accounted for as contra revenue or expense
Product development was up from continued investments in our product experiences across all of our platforms
G&A expense was up year-over-year as operating leverage was more than offset by acquisition and disposition related costs
For the year, operating margin was 31.1% down 250 basis points
Foreign exchange impacted full-year margin by 160 basis points and the remaining impact was from incremental investments in product development and stand-up costs
Before moving to Q4 EPS, I wanted to highlight two topics, taxes and hedging
We are continually evaluating our legal structure in the way we manage and operate our platforms
During Q4, we began the process of realigning our legal structure, which is expected to continue into 2018 primarily impacting our international entities
We are considering many factors and evaluating this realignment including foreign exchange exposures, long-term cash flows and needs of our platforms, capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects
As a result, of the initial stages of this re-alignment we recorded a non-cash GAAP income tax benefit of approximately $4.6 billion in Q4 to recognize a differed tax asset
The non-cash amortization of this deferred tax asset will significantly impact our GAAP tax rate going forward
But has no impact on our free cash flow or our non-GAAP tax rate
As we have discussed in the past, post separation due to hedge accounting considerations our revenue was fully exposed to currency movements
However our hedging program allowed us to economically protect net income, helping to reduce the 160 basis points of foreign exchange impact on 2016 operating margin by 70 basis points
Therefore the impact on net profit margin was only about 90 basis points
Re-alignment of our legal structure and U.S
GAAP considerations resulted in us to having to replace our existing hedging program with a new hedging program
Implementing a new hedge strategy required us to start unwinding the existing program resulting in a Q4 gain of $16 million from the termination of certain cash flow hedges
Beginning in the second half of 2017, we will start to utilize hedge accounting to protect revenue from currency movements, which is intended to reduce the volatility of our top line from foreign exchange
We will complete the transition of our hedging programs by the end of the first half of 2017. Turning now to EPS on Slide 12, in Q4 we delivered $0.54 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.04 versus prior year, driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of a stronger US dollar
In Q4, GAAP EPS was $5.31, up $4.88 versus last year
The increase in GAAP EPS was driven by aforementioned realignment of our legal structure, as well as the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre
As always, you can find a detailed reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and our earnings presentation
On Slide 13, in Q4 we generated $484 million of free cash flow, inclusive of $272 million of cash taxes paid on the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre
As a reminder the proceeds from the sale are included in the investing activities on the statement of cash flows, while the cash taxes paid are included in the operating activities
Full year free cash flow was $2.2 billion
CapEx was 6% of revenue in Q4 and we finished the full year at 7%
CapEx was at the low end of our guidance range partially driven by the timing of some investments that we now expect to happen in 2017. Turning to Slide 14, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $11 billion, with $2.8 billion in the U.S
In Q4 we’ve repurchased 34.6 million shares at an average price of $28.93 per share, amounting to $1 billion in total
This brings our repurchases for the year to $3 billion and repurchases since separation to $4.2 billion or approximately 13% of the shares outstanding
We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining
As we wrap up the year I would like to remind everyone of our capital allocation policy which we believe strides the most value for our customers, shareholders and employees our policy is several key tenets including focusing on long-term value creation while making sure we offer the resources to execute our strategy driving growth while balancing profitability supplementing organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments, and optimizing financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital
Heading into 2017 these principles will continue to guide our capital allocation while there are many macroeconomic uncertainties we will be disciplined in our investments and potential acquisition and we expect to return capital to shareholders and a minimum of 50% of our pre-cash flow in the former share repurchase inclusive of the dilution offset
Before turning to guidance and like to highlight some changes in disclosure
First, in order to align our internal operations and how we talk about the business we have started reporting B2C and C2C growth and we will no longer report fixed price and auction format growth however we will continue to provide the format split on our website
Second, structured data will continue to be a critical enabler of our business as Devin mentioned the focus in 2017 will shift towards exposing our new experiences to more traffic and driving data quality to improve execution – conversion
While continuing to make progress on penetration of structured data, we will no longer be disclosing the operational input metrics of listings coverage and percent process
We will be providing quantitative updates and qualitative updates on output measures such as traffic and conversion
Moving to full-year guidance on Slide 15, we’re projecting 2017 revenue between $9.3 billion and $9.5 billion growing 6% to 8%
The midpoint of our projected growth assumes roughly two points of acceleration in the marketplace platform partially offset by the tougher comps for StubHub and PayPal operating agreement revenue
We expect operating margin of 29% to 31%% for the year widget the midpoint is roughly 110 basis points lower than 2016 due to the impact of a stronger U.S
dollar as well as incremental investments in product development and marketing
The increase product development cost investments will focus on our new shopping experiences C2C and enhancements to key verticals
We will also continue to invest in marketing, particularly brand advertising to grow our active buyers and do increase consideration in GMV
We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.98 to $2.03 per share, up 5% to 8% as reported versus last year
The impact of the stronger U.S
dollar will cost is roughly six points of EPS growth
Finally, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20% to 21% CapEx of 7% to 9% of revenue in free cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion
Full-year GAAP EPS is projected to be 120 to 140 per share GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS in addition to the amortization of intangibles stock-based compensation and the amortization from our previously discussed deferred tax assets
Turning to Q1 guidance on Slide 16. For Q1 we are projecting revenue between $2.17 billion and $2.21 billion growing 4% to 6% year-over-year, which at the midpoint is a one point deceleration versus Q4, due to leap year lapping
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48 per share, representing negative 2% to positive 2% as reported year-over-year growth
EPS is driven by the net benefit of our share repurchase program and revenue growth offset by the impact of a stronger U.S
dollar and the lapping of a Q1 2016 insurance recovery
In summary, 2016 was a year focused on our strategy to provide the best choice most relevant and powerful selling platform to our users
While replatforming the business we said we would – growth would be constrained, but the investments in marketplace platform and marketing have already started delivering some benefits
Along the way we have remained disciplined capital allocators returning 3 billion to shareholders in the former share repurchases and realigning significant – and realizing significant gains from our investments in MercadoLibre and Snapdeal
We also executed several deals to further tech and talent and geographic expansion
Within the year our revenue grew 7% versus the 2% to 5% range we expected coming into 2016 and we levered 3% EPS growth in the face of foreign exchange headwinds an incremental investments
Heading into 2017 we will stay consistent in our approach executing our strategy delivering better experiences to our customers and returning capital to shareholders
Now we’d be happy to answer your questions
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
Yes on the second it’s likely that we well have different forms of modernization including potentially different services but not if it involves software deployment
It was my decision ultimately to dispose of GSI and that platform in large part because we are an Internet company not a B2B software company and I just don’t think that’s the business we should be running
But if you look at what other marketplaces have done they’ve offered other services and I would never say never to that is not directly in our 2017 plan however advertising as
We are very excited about our plan basically to continue the shift from third-party ads to first-party ads
What that means largely is that historically we’ve taken a large amount of our ads from third parties and that drove our users off of eBay to their experience we try to do that anyway that maximized the user experience, the buyer experience but increasingly we’re seeing good results from internal ads, ads from eBay sellers promoting their inventory in our search results and in other places on our site
And for us that’s a really, really good flywheel because keeps our buyers inside our marketplace, it allows us to create a new stream of monetization and it allows our sellers to buy up for promotional activities
So there’ll be a big shift in the direction this year
It will start to show up in 2017 but it is certainly part of our future plans to accelerate our advertising growth
Rich may be to your other question
Just to point out something on promoted listings
We’ve been talking about promoted listings for over a year closer to probably 18 months and what we been talking about is a very nascent product that we’re experiencing with
The we launched it and started to scale it
And I think this year we have a lot of confidence that not only the tools that we are providing sellers to be able to use and bulk upload to be able to manage those promoted listings, but is that scales and scales across different countries as well we feel really good about that
But I’d like to just point out that won’t show up in MS now [ph] and so while it is effectively first party advertising the way you might think about it the way you account for it because ultimately you paid on a transaction that does end up and take rate in transaction revenue
Yes, no I don’t think structurally – what I would point to in terms of our overall take rate – if you point to the Q4 take rate as maybe a proxy
What you saw in marketplaces take rate specific to marketplaces is you always have the normal mix shift in the variability between what products are selling and sellers in countries et cetera
But what you saw was about a 7.6% take rate and about 10% – 10 basis points of the decline that was year-over-year was largely driven by pricing
And I would point towards some of the consumer pricing that Devin and I spoke about in our prepared remarks where we are experimenting and changing the way we incent consumer sellers to buy and sell on our site
And that is – that’s something that I think we’ll continue to see but whether that relates back to the overall advertising and a structural take rate shift I don’t think so
Sure
So a couple – obviously several points in there – a couple of things first let me start at the macro
The reason we’re switching again is it’s really the way we always try and talk to – and the way we run the business
And so instead of point it due to fixed price and options is a proxy quarter-to-quarter we just said look but be real clear about what is
And so when we look at marketplace specific B2C growth quarter – this quarter we were at 6% and that was flat with prior quarter
And C2C it actually accelerated by five points out of the negative to up to 3%
And so back to my comment on the incentives that we are driving for consumers, we feel like that starting – as well as some of the services that we are providing that starting to make nice impact
As it relates to quantification it actually depends by country whether you are qualified as a B2C or a C2C seller
In some countries to be B2C seller you must register, generally speaking the split is that 10,000 a year, all right
When you think about our overall GMV about 80% of our GMV is through B2C sellers that do over $10,000 a and the rest is 20% that’s less that
Look, we have $1.2 billion in international cash at this point and $2.8 billion in the U.S
?
Yes, so a couple of things, maybe first let’s step back and think about the long-term of these two businesses
We feel very good about both of these businesses, specific the Classifieds
Why they commented on the deceleration quarter-to-quarter, we did not anticipate a structural change in underlying growth of that business
That business has been mid to low – double-digits in the teens for the last few years and we expect that to continue
And so my comment there was more about quarter-to-quarter
There’s always going to be quarter-to-quarter comping dynamics in you and your growth dynamics that will explain but just structural as we think about it
Really for StubHub, this next year we’re going to have three, four quarters of pretty tough comps for the StubHub business but as we look towards the long-term and the efforts that we have going, not only in the product and the deals that we are doing there
But also in the international expansion
We’re very bullish on that business and when I’ve called out – pretty much every quarter that will be facing some degree of lapping to the tune of about one point from StubHub over the next year and we will update to each quarter in terms of how things are going
The other things I’d point it too, in terms of what’s putting some pressure on I called it out in the prepared remarks is the operating agreement
So we’ve got about half a point is little bit more than a point – little bit more than half a point of year-on-year lapping in revenue
And that will be about a point each quarter in the first half and then will be fully out of the lapping with operating agreements in the second half
That’s another dynamic that we are facing into
Underlying that what we’re telling you in our guidance is that marketplace we expect to accelerate two points year-over-year, one to two points year-over-year and that’s on the basis of all the things that Devin just talked about
Let’s start with the latter question first
Look, I think it’s important obviously everyone has questions, but we don’t know what the timing or implications or substance of any tax reform or border taxation might be; it’s very much in the air
That’s not to say that we aren’t modeling scenarios and looking at the impacts that we don’t know about yet, just trying to get a sense
So I think it’s a bit too early to comment or provide much clarity
I would just go to our model that you pointed out in your question
Our model is different than a traditional retailer or e-trailer
And say you would expected to have a little bit different dynamic on our underlying financials that if anything was done
How I think about it in the data points I point to we talked about in the past that CBT is a little bit less than 20% of our overall GMV, so that’s product going between borders that might be exposed to a – but there’s no single quarter in that number that’s greater than a third, right
So if a border tax was implemented there would be some considerations like replacement or cannibalization or other alternatives that get provided
And then there would be the border tax implication
So we will work through that as we get clarity
To your first point on margins, so 29% to 31% midpoint of 30% are there unusuals or structural things this year – this coming year? I would point to each quarter we try and be transparent with what goes into our results
Last quarter there was a VAT adjustment
This quarter there was an adjustment for de-designation of hedges due to the change in our hedging strategy
Beginning of the year there were other items
Are they material in any given quarter? They can drive a point
Is it structural in nature and something that we’ve included in our guidance? Yes, it’s in their
Is that long-term and structural? No
Devin, I don’t know if you want to talk about kind of the longer – how we think about the longer term structure though
And just a point on that
So for 2017 our margin – as I said it was 29% to 31%
That’s 110 basis points down versus 2016 and half of that is foreign exchange and the other half is the product development and the marketing investments that we talked about
So relatively small erosion year-over-year from investments that we are going to make – to drive the growth that we are committing to
And what we’ve said is we don’t wake up like Devin said but we will remain disciplined as we think about additional investments to make sure that those returns are good
And I think we’ve proven that we can do that over the last 18 months
Hi, Mark
I’ll take both of those
First off on the second one first
Yes, so the guidance as I said is a minimum of a $1 billion
The consideration for July is out there
It’s something that we’re thinking about
And the way I would think about it is that’s our programmatic commitment and we’ll move from there depending on a lot of things, plus timing and July deadlines, before that’s clear
On the second one, it’s a great question on active buyers
Look, bear with me for a second and I will kind of dig down into active buyer growth
So our active buyer growth at $3 million – at $165 million – what $167 million up $5 million year-on-year and $2 million quarter-on-quarter, I explained I won’t rehash the cohort dynamic that I had in my script
But if you remove StubHub and you remove India, and you just talk about the core business of marketplaces in the major markets where we started to do advertising in late Q3 and early Q4, what we started to see on a trailing three-month basis is some acceleration in trailing three-month growth which is a green shoots for us and obviously I don’t like having to go, take-up StubHub, take out India to explain it
But that’s what we think, that’s where we draw some of our conclusion and confidence about moving that metric going forward because that is certainly a metric that we called out today and we called out in the past that we expect to move not only from our marketing and branding campaigns but some of the other initiatives that we talked about
Yes, absolutely
I kind of called out in my prepared remarks
The total is exactly the dynamic that you called out
But what we’ve been doing is between platforms and within platform and within different channels we’ve been shifting
We’ve been talking about that we’re shifting to brand and so we’ve effectively done is reduced spend in other areas that we felt had lower ROI or that was less strategic, and shifted into the brand campaign in the core marketplace’s business, and that was true across platforms and into the marketplace’s platform
And on the other side we continue to expand channels like social and other aspects to try and make sure that our traffic that we are generating from structured data and the SCO channel to social is expanding and providing us the capability to not only attract new users but to drive active user growth and active buyer growth as we talked about
Operator, we have time for one more question
