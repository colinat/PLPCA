Thank you, Matt and good morning, everybody
I'll start with EPS
Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, down 4.7% after excluding a $0.12 per share charge related to the previously announced UK pension settlement
The $0.41 was better than our $0.37 outlook, largely due to our better margins in international and SPD business, some help from tax, slightly higher sales and lower SG&A spending
Reported revenues were up 2.3% to $898 million, organic sales were 1.8%, at the high end of our 1% to 2% range
Organic sales growth was driven by our international consumer business, and our SPD division
Now, let's review the segments
The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales were flat as couponing and promotional investments impacted net sales growth
Growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergents, OXICLEAN laundry detergent and stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was offset by declines in XTRA laundry detergent, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kits and TROJAN condoms
We expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2% for the Consumer Domestic business
International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, STERIMAR, OXICLEAN stain-fighter in Mexico and BATISTE, VMS and FEMFRESH in Australia
So, just broad based growth across the globe
We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 7% for the international business
For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 9.4%, due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business
Milk prices and U.S
dairy farm profitability remain at a higher level than a year ago
We are raising our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 2% to 3% to up approximately 6%
Turning now to gross margin
Our adjusted second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago
This was a bit better than we'd originally expected, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on the international and SPD side
The Q2 gross margin decline breaks out as follows
We had higher promotional levels in Q2, which resulted in a drag of 180 basis points, gross margin improvement of 70 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity net of commodities was worth about 30 basis points of improvement
Moving now to marketing
Marketing as a percent of revenue hit a recent high of 14.6%
Remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that we were beefing up Q2 marketing
Historically, big quarters were Q2 and Q4, this year Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation
SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a 460-basis point increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement
On an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 13% – was 13% of sales up 20 basis points, primarily due to increased amortization from acquisitions
Now to operating profit
The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, which was 190 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to the marketing shift and higher promotional spending
Other expense was $6.4 million, primarily driven by $9.5 million of interest
Next is income taxes
Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% on an adjusted basis
Turning to cash, we generated approximately $250 million of net cash for the first half, a $47 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital, which was a function of a $30 million increase in deferred incentive comp plus higher inventories
This was partially offset by higher cash earnings
So, in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by our investments in our domestic business, continued strong growth in international and a return to growth in our Specialty Products segment
Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of 3.5% which reflects the consumer domestic business growing at approximately 3%
Just a remainder 2016 growth was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, therefore the second half of 2017 will benefit from easier comps
On a two-year stack basis, the first and second half are consistent at around 5%
Gross margin is expected to contract in Q3 with increased levels of promotion and coupon investments
We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year-over-year, with the shift from Q4 to Q3 to continue our innovation support
We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, compared to $0.47 a year ago, or a 2% decrease year-over-year, which includes $0.02 of dilution from the Water Pik acquisition
The primary drivers of the decrease are higher marketing in support of our new product launches and higher consumer promotional spending
As we end the year, we expect strong earnings growth in Q4, as heavy coupons around new product trial peels off, and the marketing goes back to normal levels
And now, turning to the full year, and as I go through these metrics please keep in mind that we are excluding any impact from Water Pik
We're maintaining our expectations for organic sales growth of 3%, we maintain our gross margin improvement guidance of 40 bps improvement year-over-year
Our full-year marketing expectations is approximately 12% of sales consistent with prior years
Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points improvement, when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges
Other expense is expected to be around $31 million, primarily driven by interest expense, which does not include any interest expense from the Water Pik acquisition
And the tax rate is expected to be around 33%
On a reported basis, we continue to expect EPS to be $1.79, which includes the $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.12 negative impact from the pension settlement and no impact from the Water Pik acquisition
Excluding those items, we expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share
And as mentioned previously for the full-year, we expect no net impact from the Water Pik acquisition
To wrap up, we expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year
This represents an excess of 120% free cash flow conversion
We also have some good news on the pension settlement front
We were able to beat our original expectations of settlement costs and we have no further pension risk or volatility to worry about as a company
So now Matt and I will open it up for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Yeah
And the only thing I'd add to that Dara is, of the 600-basis point drag on a price mix perspective, about a third of that was to drive new products and trial
So, again it's not going to repeat forever
I'll let Matt talk about a macro perspective but for us it's also some of the comps Dara
In the first half of 2016 we as a company grew 4%
And so, in the first half of this year, it's around 2%
So it's the inverse of that in the second half, we grew at about around 2% in 2016, and 4% is our expectation in 2017. So a couple of our big categories like vitamin and laundry, that's what the comps are for the prior year
I'll take that, Kevin
It's a couple of things, really
Domestic, we brought down slightly
Personal care in the front half was negative in the quarter especially, but we believe that's going to turnaround because of the comps and other category growth in the back half
So we feel good about that
To the degree that we get any benefits from FX, remember we're typically spending that back
So to be blunt, our marketing line will probably go up slightly versus our previous expectations
So we just reinvest that if we need to
So I guess, that's a short answer
Kevin, I'll take the first part maybe
P&G and everybody always continues to, it's a promotional category, laundry is always a promotional category
But in the long term, if you take a step back, what's happening at the end of the day, the premium tier usually wins with innovation and the value tier wins because of value and the mid-tier shrinks
I would say that's no different than what's been happening for the last 52 weeks, 26 weeks and 13 weeks
And so, if they promote a little bit more, that's usually the higher end
So, I've got three questions here
I'll take the first one
Really, it's all relative to your perspective, Steve
I mean for us, we aren't outspending the competition, and I'll give you a couple of facts
For the quarter, our amount sold on deal for laundry detergent was 36%
On average the category was 35%
For couponing, this is more of a limited measurement, but our data says we're around 30% and the category is around 27%, 28%
So, maybe we're a basis point two or higher
For a long time, we've kind of held back, but I think we are not making the situation worse, we're just getting up to par with our competition
As Matt said, some of the personal care items are down
So it just looks like the negative drag on price mix because some of our household businesses have higher trade rates
So I think that's part of it
I think and the other part, it's probably some of these trial activities are very enticing for the consumer
And so, when that happens, the volume goes up, but also price – the negative price mix goes up right along with it
So, that's kind of what happened I think in both cases
Hey, Jason
Yeah, sure
I'll start with that one and then go into the, kind of the outlook again, but in my script I said we had a drag of about 180 basis points on promotional spending, with negative price mix, mainly negative price
We had a 30 basis point drag from commodities, plus 60 basis point on productivity and then we had around 80 basis points of help from acquisitions and divestitures to get to the minus 80 basis points for the quarter
And so we're essentially flat to slightly up for the first half
I think as you look at the second half, there's a few things going on
Number one, some of that new product trial, the deep couponing kind of that peels off as you get the repeat purchases without all the promotional activity
So, that's a good thing for gross margin
I think our productivity pipeline continues to improve
Commodities, the drag gets a little less in the second half as we start to lap some of the negativity we had in the back half of 2016. I think, the personal care question you raise is a fair one, but I think more than anything, it's more of a comp analysis
Again, a good example of that is just this, the VMS business was very promotional in the first half of 2016 as well because we were winning back the consumer because we were out of stock in 2015. And so we don't have that level of promotion
Is the category maybe a little bit more promotional, yes
But, year-over-year it still won't comp that
So, hopefully that helps
Okay, Andrea
So, there is a couple of questions in there
The first is on Water Pik, you're exactly right
It's flat for the full year
We have a $0.02 drag in Q3, largely because of the transactional and transitional expenses and not a full quarter worth of earnings
And then a plus $0.02 for the fourth quarter and flat for the year
Your second question, so that implies with our Q3 outlook, that implies a 20% growth rate in earnings in Q4. You're exactly right, that's really two things, 20% is around $0.09 and that's really two things
One is that half of it is the shift of marketing that we've been talking about all year long, right we said we're going to move a lot of our Q4 spending into Q2 and Q3 to better line up with our new product launches
That's about half of it
The other half is, as we've mentioned before we have a better organic growth rate in the back half of the year, so and some gross margin improvement
So, those are the two things driving 20% growth
And then the third question you had was a 400 basis point drag in couponing
Now remember a year ago – that's not just couponing by itself, it's also couponing trade spends and plotting and what not
So, it's a little lumpy in 2016 compared to 2017. I'd tell you that we have some promotional spending throughout the balance of the year, but it's not like we're pulling everything back and we hope we're going to continue to do great without spending
Like we said before, we're hitting our levels right at our competition
I understand
The biggest driver is actually mix right
We've said in the first half of the year, part of that 400 basis points drag is personal care, right
And so we expect personal care to be better in the second half right
My answer to Lauren was part of the reason we have a negative price mix, when you look at organic growth is because we have more household increase and then personal care declining
And so just as that naturally balances back out that will improve the negative drag on the price mix line too
And the laundry category is only up around 1% or 1.5%
So it's not like the consumption was sky high
No, Olivia, we still have growth in untracked channels, we're not lapping any big gains or anything like that
We still have growth, it's just the biggest driver is between the Nielsen data and even when you add in the untracked stuff is the negative drag from couponing
And there is a little bit of retailer inventory shifts but the primary driver is the gross to net couponing stuff
