Thanks Maria and good morning everyone
In terms of our full year 2016 results, I’ll focus my comments on organic sales on our market shares and current market conditions
Then I'll address our outlook for 2017. So starting with our results
As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were up about 2% for the year
In developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth even though we were impacted by category declines in some markets and by price competition in China
Let's take a look at some of our key markets
In Eastern Europe organic sales in diapers increased by more than 15%
Results there were led by Huggies in Russia with double digit volume growth and 1 point of market share improvement
In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices
Our market share was pretty similar year-on-year in China
Looking ahead in the China market, we expect another year of significant volume growth
Category demand should remain strong and we have lots of innovation coming on Huggies including a new super premium diaper pants that we recently launched on Singles Day in November
Based on market trends in the last 2016 were cautiously optimistic that pricing in China will be less negative than 2017. Turning now to Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care were down slightly for the year
Category volumes fell throughout 2016 and competitive activity on diapers picked up in the second half of the year
Our market share for the year was down in Brazil 1 point diapers, but up 2 point in feminine care
We expect that market conditions will remain difficult in Brazil in 2017 particularly in the first half of the year
In Argentina, volumes in Personal Care were down high single digits and that’s similar to the overall category
Conditions were more challenging in the backup of the year and we're continuing to closely watch the dynamics in this market
Our adult care and feminine care businesses in developing and emerging markets had very strong organic sales growth, double digits for adult care and high single digits for feminine care
In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were even year-on-year
Moving now to North America, our consumer businesses achieved 3% volume growth and had excellent operating profit performance for the year
Overall, market shares were stable year-on-year in a pretty competitive environment overall
Looking at key categories in North America
In child care volumes were up high single digits with benefits from category growth and innovation on pull-ups training pants
Baby wipes volumes increased mid-single digits
On Huggies diapers volumes were down low-single digits while market shares were up about half a share point
In adult care, volumes rose mid-single digits aided by category growth and innovation on Poise and Depend
Then lastly in feminine care and in Consumer Tissue, volumes in both businesses were up low single digits
Moving to K-C Professional in North America our organic sales were up 2% and we think that’s a little bit ahead of the market in that space
So overall while we experienced challenging category conditions in 2016, particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets, our market shares are broadly healthy and holding up well in this environment
Now moving beyond sales
I'm very encouraged with our performance on cost savings, margins, cash flow and return on invested capital
Results on these metrics were excellent and we’re ahead of plan across the board and demonstrating the continued strength and great execution by our business teams
Finally we grew the bottom line by 5% and that’s in line with our guidance for the year
Now moving onto our outlook for the coming year
In 2017 we’ll continue to execute our global business plan strategies
Our teams will invest in innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to keep our brands strong
We also continue to manage our Company with financial discipline, focusing on cost savings, cash flow and shareholder friendly capital allocation
In terms of our specific guidance, on the top line we’re targeting organic sales growth of approximately 2% that’s broadly in line with our assumption for overall market growth in 2017. But we're expecting only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets
But we aren’t expecting growth to pick back up significantly in 2017, we're still very optimistic about the long-term possibilities for us in these markets
Innovation continues to be an important part of our growth plans
In developing and emerging markets we've got a number of launches planned in diapers and diaper pants, feminine care and adult care
We also have a strong line up in North America
Near term activity includes upgrades on Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Goodnites Youth Pants and Depend underwear
We expect that organic sales growth will be higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of the year and that’s largely because of tougher comparisons in the first half of the year
On the bottom line we’re targeting earnings per of $6.20 to $6.35 and that’s up 3% to 5% compared to our adjusted results in 2016. We plan to achieve solid improvements in both growth and operating margins in 2017 and that’s despite an expectation for a mid-to-high single digit drag on earnings on the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices
Our outlook also includes a meaningful decline in equity income that's driven by the weaker Mexican peso, which impacts our earnings for K-C de Mexico
Recent spot rates for the peso have been down 15% or more compared to the average rate for 2016. In terms of capital allocation, you should expect us to continue to be shareholder friendly
We expect to allocate between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2017. That's a higher amount than in 2016 and that’s equivalent to 5% to 6% of our current market capitalization
So all in all, we remain focused on continuing to compete effectively in the near term as we execute our global business plans strategies for long term success and shareholder value creation
That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we’ll begin to take your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
I think I would say, we’re going to have some carry-over price drag in places like China
We still probably will get some additional positive price in markets like Brazil and Argentina, but we're not counting on a lot of price
In some of these markets the consumer has been pushed pretty hard and we just don't see of a big opportunity to take price
And even in markets like the U.K
where you’ve had though the Brexit phenomena, we will try to take some small positive price increases, but we're not counting on a lot of that to drive our year in 2017. So I think while the currency hit isn't as big as it’s been in the past, the commodities we're assuming that oil is up double digits and secondary fiber is up double digits
But some others like eucalyptus pulp is going to be pretty flat, but we’d just say the net of that is we're not counting on a lot of price in 2017.
Both of those
We’ve tend to try to innovate on the premium end
We want all of our innovation to be margin accretive where ever we can
In markets like Brazil though, we are making sure we’re innovating on the low tier when the category is moving down into tier 2, you want to make sure you've got a good performing product and can make competitive claims
And so we are trying to make sure we're innovating where the consumer is moving toward
Thanks, Wendy
Yeah so, I guess, the way I’d come out that, I’d say the marketing research general did not include advertising in that number so that would really be the cost of the marketers and any marketing research or other things
I would say if you just looked at the quarter there was probably some more timing things particularly on our R&D where the third quarter was a little heavier than the fourth quarter, which is a little unusual for us
But that why I probably look at the full year number to be more predictive, our advertising spend overall was pretty similar to the prior year fourth quarter, but down a little bit sequentially
So that’s not that unusual
We continue to see shifts out of advertising into digital couponing and a lot of that cost gets captured between gross and net sales
So you don't really get good visibility of that
But as you think about the top line in 2017, the way I would come out at it is that we're calling a roughly 2%, that's roughly what we did in 2016 on average
2016 was very front half loaded and the back half was fairly wide as you described and 2017 from a cost standpoint, you know have tougher comps in the front half and easier comps in the back half, so I think we’re calling fairly similar overall to what we saw for the full year in 2016.
Yeah, that’s right way to think about it
Yeah, I wouldn't say any of it, it will be much more market specific, so in places like Brazil and Argentina where there's a lot of local market inflation, not necessarily even big commodity categories
You know that they will be taking price up in those markets
Will they recover all it? You know I think that’s an open question
You are seeing more competitive activity in some of those markets
We still have some of the carryover drag from some of the Chinese price reductions that we experienced in 2016 that will be a drag in 2017. In markets like the U.K
or in or even in North America, the level of inflation that we're seeing, we may get some pricing in case KCP around secondary fiber where we’ve got double digit price increases in secondary fiber
But I wouldn't expect to get much price on our other broad consumer categories just because the inflation level isn't that big relative to the size of those businesses
The other the other thing Ali is that we feel pretty good about our cost savings going forward
And so our ability to absorb a little bit of inflation, these are fairly low inflation numbers, relative to what we've seen in the past and generating cost savings in the $400 million in a year, it gives us the ability to recover some of that and be competitive in the marketplace
Is there an all of the above answer I can choose, Lauren on that one
Because I think it is a little bit of all of those I think
There is – growth rates in a lot of our categories have slowed
We said we were expecting category growth rates of roughly 2%
We would have said several years ago three to four was probably more what we were trending
So growth rates have come down, there's still lots of competition including local competitors who are aggressively pursuing business and we're trying to make sure we’ve got the right innovation, we got the right price point, we’re executing well in market and that probably makes it a little tougher in this environment to get price increases, in a market like Brazil, where the category is going backwards 3% to 4% in volume and you're taking list price up, you can generate some short-term category value increases, you don't want it to be a race to zero either
There's been a pretty big category shift in the last year where training pants category growth is up strong double digits and diaper category growth is down a little bit
Since I got Mike Hsu here on his first call Mike is running North American business, why don’t you weigh in on that one Mike and give them a little color around that
So we were up a couple of percent or percent and a half or simple like last year
Yeah Lauren, it’s probably playing out the biggest in diapers and because of a couple of factors
The non-measured, the online channels are growing at a rapid rate and so you can't see some of the customers that are in there
Also some of the changes in terms of who is reporting with whom between Nielsen RRI [ph] also going to start affecting us as well
So it's a bit of a challenge right now when we're working through some of these issues too
Thanks, Lauren
Yeah, that's a key question, Jason
Obviously, I’d say, Latin America economic recovery would be a key driver
So if you look at Brazil, Argentina, they’re taking a pretty big shock, but Brazil in particular from lower oil prices
As those come back that we’ve got pretty big business with down there that could tier a lot of top line growth issues
On the other hand, as you look at places like Russia, China, still very strong category volume growth and we still see big penetration opportunities in lots of markets around the world
So I think that's why we would still say long-term there’s huge opportunity here for us
In the short-term we're at a little slower spot than the GDP growth per capita of range that we're going to make the categories go at a little slower rate
Yeah, well, call it other Jason, because it is just a big unknown, but no seriously, I’ll let Maria give you a little bit of color, but there’s a lot of local inflation in there
We also have other product improvement costs would be in there, so for upgrading and adding functionality to a product we would put that into that line
Any start-up costs for new capital equipment around the world would go into that line, I don’t know Maria, if there’s anything else you would add to that or build on that
I would say that line tends to be pretty similar year-to-year, but I don’t know Paul, if you’ve got any other, we have never tried to forecast other, so
Pretty similar year-to-year
Each country team would have their own wage and benefit program and we just – as we break out the analysis of change and share that with you, we capture those cost increases on the other bucket and so I think that’s the nature of the question that was asked
So we try to run a very efficient corporate overhead team and Maria oversees the corporate G&A budget and I know they're planning for a fairly flat, I don’t know if you want to comment on how you’re approaching that going into 2017.
Trust me if we were sending our operating unit teams bigger bills from corporate, we would hear about it, so
Yeah that local share seems very high to me
I mean, you’ve got essentially four big global diaper players with P&G is still the share leader
Their share is high teens
Our share would be high teens
Kao would be similar and Unit Term [ph], I think it's about 10 share
Then [Hang On] which is the local players about a 5 share
So I think Caroline it may depend on which dataset you're looking at their because there’s a substantial portion of the Chinese market is in e-commerce
Another good chunk is in baby superstores and then there is relatively smaller segment than you might see in other markets that are in traditional retail
So if you looked at a just a Nielsen traditional retail number you could probably get a high share for a local player but that’s covering a very small part of the market
Well, I think the pricing is down double digits for the year, a lot of that happened in the – started really in late of 2015, but rolled through early 2016. Our expectation is going into 2017 that pricing is not going to get better in the short term
We do see good category volume growth, see a strong growth rate, high single digit, maybe even low double digit increase in births in China, good category participation rate
So there aren’t many markets in the world that are growing that fast and it's not surprising that that there's a lot of competition there
Our team has done a fantastic job of is improving the products and reducing our costs, so that our margins overall in China are still quite attractive
Thank you Caroline
For Personal Care, should still be the fastest growing segment I would say overall
KCP had about 1 point drag this year on their segment organic growth due to lower sales to Halyard and some of our internal nonwovens, so that was expected because that supply agreement kind of wound down
So we won't have that negative comp of holding them back in 2017, so KCP could be a bit higher
Consumer Tissue I'd say overall will be pretty similar
Stephen Powers Okay
And then Maria if we turn to FORCE, I know there are a ton of moving parts and how you run that program from the bottom up
But is there any way you can call out any kind of bucket of costs in particular in terms of where you saw upside in fiscal 2016, just looking back over the year
Then more importantly, where you expect the most incremental improvement to come in 2017 because the momentum
Both based on what you achieved in 2016 and what you’re indicating that for 2017 is well ahead of where I think you would have put it a year ago at this time
So I’m just trying to understand better where you're seeing that momentum sourced from? Thanks
Just a thing I would add to that is Maria and our new supply chain leader, Sandra MacQuillan, have done a great job of driving inventory down
As we have – had held less inventory you get lots of other distribution and logistics savings and that probably another area that we’ve done better and I think there's more to come there
A – Maria Henry Yeah I would agree with that and I think that really helped us on the cash flow side
We put two days off of our CCC, that was in the high end of our expectations and a lot of that improvement was driven by inventory, which I'm particularly pleased with the teams are very focused on that area
Not only global supply chain, but the local teams are really doing a great job on working capital
Stephen Powers Okay
Thanks
Yeah, I mean, I’d say the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe we have enough pant capacity and so we’ve been at and that’s pretty much we’ve been adding pant capacity in major market in the world
We got new assets in China, Brazil, Russia, Czech Republic even Central America
And so - and our team in Mexico has also added capacity, so yeah we do feel pretty good about that
Not to get too technical, but the grade change between the diaper and a pant would be time consuming enough, that you probably wouldn't want to do it very often, so it's better to have dedicated assets
Yeah, I mean, I think the end game for us is deliver winning products, build market share and sustain your business over time
You know it's kind of tried and true techniques and in China we invested a ton in 2016 in our newborn program to make sure that we were capturing new moms and carrying them through
We're doing a lot of hospital sampling in many markets around the world to make sure that mom goes home from the hospital with the right products
And so it's all the basics
I mean, as we deconstruct some of the P&Ls to attempt of our key our competition, I think these are still attractive businesses, even at reduced prices and we've been good at getting the cost out to help protect our margins structure
And so we want the diaper to work better and cost less and if we can continue to deliver on that, yeah, that makes it tougher for anybody to compete with us
I don’t know if that addresses it specifically
There’s another part to your question, Bill, I don’t know if I answered better or not
I think the point I would make there is that e-commerce is making pricing more transparent everywhere
So there's more – you know if retailers just to comp each other’s promoted prices and now e-commerce you can go comp three websites quick and easy and there’s apps that'll do it for you and so I think that's probably driving more of an EDLP type environment recognizing, there’s still room for some promotion
I don’t know Mike if you've got a view of that of what you see in North America
Nothing really unusual and that’s said just we were probably tightly controlling spend, but as you would hope we are always doing
But I would say no there was no unusual item that rolled through there
Thanks, Bill
That is a left field question Nik, I think that would be the first time I have had that one
But let me answer the first question
So the global consumer I would say probably a bit of a mixed bag if you're in a economy that had oil as a large part your economy, but you’re feeling still some pressure
So now you saw negative GDP in Russia
Nigeria, certainly under pressure, very slow or negative GDP per capita growth there
Some of the challenges in Brazil have been there as well
So if you're a oil consuming nation you’ve got a big windfall in 2016 and so a pretty good GDP per capita growth generally or improving
So I would say if you look at a market like China, the underlying category demand growth, the birth rate those are all really positive signals
Despite a little bit of a little bit of a slowdown in their overall GDP growth, you still saw a really good growth in GDP per capita and more consumers coming in reach of our products and entering the category and starting families et cetera
And you’d see some similar things
Vietnam is a very a good market for us as well
You saw – actually saw a very – we had a terrific year in Korea, despite a fairly flattish economy, our Korean business did pretty well
So I’d say, the U.K
with Brexit
Our KCP business in particular saw, a little weaker year than we were expecting there
I think you saw some distributors not wanting to hold inventory, not certain necessarily what was happening next, that seemed like that calmed down a bit at the end of the year
is more stable at the moment and we'll see what the next step is in Brexit
But I don't know Marie if you want to add anything to that, so
A – Maria Henry Yeah, I’ll take the next one though
Okay, go ahead, do robotics – A – Maria Henry And robotics, yeah, and machine learning in back office, yeah
We have a global business services initiative at Kimberly-Clark
We've got shared services center around the globe, where we look to consolidate and optimize transaction services and more routine type of back office work
And robotics automation can be applied in those areas, so we are working with our vendors and staying on top of the technology
And understanding why is that opportunity for us
But clearly its part of our global business services initiatives where we're looking at robotics, automation, machine learning and how we might be able to change the game on that in the future
Maybe just to build on that Nik, a way to think about it is if you could think about the perfect order or the perfect payables transaction or the quantity, the price, the delivery terms, everything lined up perfectly with the purchase order or it could sale right through your system and get paid without any human involvement, that would be the gold standard
I'd say too often some of those things don't work out and you need human beings to fix and adjust and correct all those minor errors that happen
And if you think about a customer transaction, if we could take the customer's order, get the price exactly right, the quantity shipped on the date they wanted it with the correct terms
So it applies right through our system and their system without any additional intervention that's a big opportunity and it takes friction out of everyone's transaction costs
But we still got a long way to go to get to that
Yeah, I would say, Erin, it’s kind of a mixed bag if you looked at Russia, which has had a pretty good economic shock, we still saw a very strong a category growth
Our Huggies business was up double digits in volume and we had higher selling prices, lot of innovation so responsive consumer to that
Brazil on the other hand you’ve tended to see, category volume declines in the low single digits 3% to 4% over the last couple of quarters
So that would say the consumer is either reducing their household inventory or reducing their usage in some cases or shifting from five or six diapers a day to three or four diapers a day that could account for that, if a subset of the consumer base is doing that
Argentina has probably been the biggest shock, they’ve had a pretty big economic transformation under way, there are going to move some of their utility cost to more of a market rate and that's having a big impact on household budgets and you're seeing lots of categories declining in that market
I think it will take some time to really tell how that’s going to shake out
But we saw in the third and fourth quarter in Argentina double digit declines in category diaper volume, which, that’s pretty unusual, you don't see that every day
Yeah I think that’s true
I don’t Mike, do you want to comment on diaper pants broadly
A – Michael D
Hsu Yeah, I think we’re still digging through the data on that, but I do think, a part of it is, I would say yes right now it's about average
I think our training pant business leaders would say, hey you know we think mom’s should be starting earlier and so there's a strategy on their part to say, hey, we want our children to start training earlier and we want them to stay more consistent in the training pant, and so that’s long-term strategy for the pull-ups brand manager
Then for the Huggies, they want them to stay in Huggies and I think our job again here is to want to serve the consumer and how they want us to be served and give them the choices and provide the best products, so they can make the choice
Then to your point in the U.S
market we're not offering training pants that go down to newborn sizes
Or as in some of the emerging markets you do find diaper pants in smaller sizes although, usually not newborn, but usually in size one, two, you find some of those are still pretty small part of those categories
A – Michael D
Hsu Yeah, training tends to start around 18 months to 24 months
Yeah and even diaper pant usage in emerging markets tends to start when babies are a little bit more active crawling stage
Yeah, I’d say, there could be a couple of mix factors
As I said earlier in China we invested a lot in newborn in 2016, as those babies move up into the more mainstream diapers, you know we expect to see a little bit of more positive mix
And newborn hurts our mix just because there's more diapers in a bag and you sell the bag for the same price
Although you'd argue that builds your franchise, so you definitely want to have a leadership share there
But we’re probably a little overweight newborn in China and that will have an effect on us going forward
I’d say broadly we're not expecting a lot from price or mix in 2017. So I think they would both be slightly positive, but that's not going to be the story driving our growth, that’s going to be core volume
Cadence on innovation, obviously it’s going to vary by market and so typically we've got quite a bit of stuff going on in North America
Mike I don't know if you want to comment on some of the things going on in independent polls without revealing any too much competitive launch data
A – Michael D
Hsu Yeah I think the teams there, particularly in adult care were still focused on driving the category penetration, which is still a big opportunity for us, the business is performing well, up mid-to-high single digits
I think the innovation is coming
We’re really focused on that you know adding value in the category and some of things, employees within Shape [ph] and Depend in the 2016 like Depend which has been a very successful item
And then coming in 2017 new and improved super premium on Depend both real fit and silhouette
So again super premium, softer, more broadened set of performance
In China we launched a new super premium diaper pant in November and so that will really just start to get traction as we roll into of 2017.
Thank you
Yeah, Bonnie, yeah, I think the environment is elevated and I think we saw an elevation occur in the third quarter, you could probably see that through in our results back then
I think we improved in the fourth quarter, I think the team has responded well to the kind of the change in environment and ramped up their intensity in terms of both securing the right merchandising activity and the right marketing activity
I think our call is that it’s going to remain this way for a while, and that’s what we’re assuming for 2017. I think our teams are prepared for right innovation both in diapers, child care, adult care and fem care and we’re excited about our plan for 2017.
Yeah, I’d probably say comparable, but we've got some pretty good items in there and I think we’re not ready to kind of disclose what they are yet, Paul, But I think we feel good about it
Yeah, I would say you know wipers was a little - was flattish in the quarter and for the year
We saw a little bit more growth in our core washroom business, so we've driven a lot of our innovation and commercial programming around the washroom and its probably refreshed that business a little bit
We’re still seeing opportunity with wipers particularly in some of the heavy manufacturing areas, things like aeronautics and so forth, where we do a fair amount of work
So as those picked up we should see some opportunities to drive more wiper business
Yeah, no, I think that’s fair
I guess, the way I would think about it would be; number one, as economic growth globally has slowed down and some of the markets we talked about
There's just less growth around and just as many people chasing it
So that inherently will make that just a bit more competitive if you’re growing 3 to 4 and now you're growing too
And then you got the same number of competitors, it just makes – the same number of people fighting over in pieces of a smaller pie or smaller growth opportunity
So that’s probably one
I also think you're seeing more competitors, expanding into more markets
So CNPC has moved out of Chile and is now operating in Brazil and moving into Peru and they're operating in Mexico, you know that's new geography for them and they’re obviously trying to get traction in launch
We’ve seen Unit term [ph] launch in Brazil
They haven’ t build a big share position there yet, but that increases the competitive set
SCA [ph] has done acquisitions and increased their footprint globally in lots of places and so maybe it used to be us and our primary global competitor in a market, now you've got usually one or two other global players that are around and just makes it, so you got to be sharp on innovation, you got to sharp on cost and you got to be great on execution
We're up for that challenge, but there's other players in the neighborhood
I mean, I would say, this, I mean, I think the, if you think about all the weighting of those factors
The slower economic growth is the one that’s probably, that you can't do anything about but that's probably the bigger challenge
The economies are growing better
There's more growth to feed more mouths in category in particular places
And so the effect, we got more competition in more places
At the end of day, we’ve got to deliver a winning product solution at an attractive cost and execute it well on the market and so does everybody else
So yeah I'm absolutely up for that challenge
Thanks Ali
Yeah, I mean, they're pretty different markets I would say and so China is an explosive growth opportunity where more and more people as our GDP per capita improves, are entering the category
So with billion plus, people in the country that is a near limitless supply of consumers that could eventually come into our category
I’d say if you contrast it to Brazil, you probably had higher category penetration rates to start with
Unless GDP per capita growth and lately it’s been negative in GDP per capita trends
And so yeah, I’d just say it’s a different starting point and different economic
Ones a got great tailwind and one 's got a headwind that you're running against
We have launch diaper pants in Brazil, have seen pretty good conversion and launched things like, in adult care in our Depend, Plenitude, which is our brand in that part of the world
We've been pretty successful at transitioning the category from a lower cost briefs, which is more like an adult diaper to a higher cost pant will much similar to what we would sell in the U.S
, just because it’s much better solution and then deliver terrific value
Even though that is a income challenged consumer and so, you do still see responsiveness, but you don't have the explosive growth of GDP per capita and more people under in the category of that you probably have in China
Thanks Jon
Well, once again, we had a good year 2016. We've laid out an aggressive plan for our global business class strategies in 2017. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark
