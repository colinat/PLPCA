Having grown up in New England, I want to start by saying congratulation to the Super Bowl 51 Champion New England Patriots
They set some records last night and we're setting some records ourselves here today
On my first earnings call as President and CEO, I'm thrilled to share great results that Tyson Foods family delivered in the first quarter of fiscal year in 2017. It's an incredibly exciting time at Tyson as we position ourselves for the next stage of growth and I'm looking forward to leading our team as we seek to improve the value of our company for all of our stakeholders
Let's talk about our Q1, which is the best quarter in the company's history with record earnings, operating income and cash flows
Return on sales was in or above the normalized range for each of our segments and total company operating margin was a record 10.7%
In the first quarter, we capitalized on favorable market conditions in our Beef and Pork segments and the cash generated is providing fuel for growth in our value-added Chicken and Prepared Foods segments
As we outlined in our year-end 2016 call, our earnings were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by $35 million in mark-to-market and lower cost-to-market accounting treatments
This benefited our Q1 results as we started getting this back
Synergies for the quarter were $161 million, with $40 million incremental to the Q1 of 2016. Total synergies to-date are $620 million
And now for an update on our operating results which illustrates the advantage of our balanced portfolio with strong performances across the board
We'll start with Fresh Meats
In the Beef segment, our operating income was a record $299 million, with a record operating margin of 8.5%
Volume was up 4.5%, while average price was down 6.6% reflecting the lower cut-out
Plentiful cattle supplies and lower consumer pricing that stimulated both domestic and export demand contributed to the record results
Our Beef business has been challenged in the past few weeks with typical seasonality, however with cattle supplies expected to increase 3% to 4%, the remainder of the year should be very strong
At this point, we're estimating Beef segments operating margin for the year to be around 5%
The Pork segments operating income for Q1 was a record $247 million, with a record 19.7% operating margin
Volume was up 4.3%, while average price was down 1%
Demand was strong and especially in the export markets
The USDA recently issued a report stating that China will likely remain a large importer of pork given its rising production costs, constraints on land use, and stricter environmental regulations
While Tyson Foods doesn't export a significant amount of pork to China, other U.S
packers do, which creates domestic disappearance
We're certainly aware of the additional capacity coming online, but there appears to be enough hog production to support these plants, and continuing export demand should absorb the additional supply
At this point, we don't know how any changes in the U.S
trade policy might affect exports of pork or other proteins, but in general, trade restrictions that impact export demand also can affect domestic supply
We're planning for different scenarios and will be prepared to adapt if there's any change in policy
Now turning to our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments
In our Chicken segment, our first quarter operating income was $263 million, with a 9.7% operating margin
Average price was up 1.4% and volume was up 1.3%
Value-added volume was up 5%, while commodity volume declined, demonstrating that we're growing where we want to grow with products carrying higher, more stable margins
Sales price was up due to these mixed changes offsetting general market declines
Costs increased in part due to additional mass spending to support growth in the Tyson brand
We expect more pricing pressure from competing proteins for chicken while our feed costs are projected to be flat with last year
With our predominantly value-added mix, the Chicken segment should be in the upper end of its normalized range of 9% to 11% return on sales for the year
In our Prepared Foods segment, operating income in the first quarter was $190 million with a 10% operating margin
Average price was down 2.9%, reflecting lower raw material costs passed through to customers, volume increased to 2.9% offsetting lower pricing
Synergies within the Prepared Foods segment were $127 million for the quarter, with $32 million incremental to Q1 of 2016. As a reminder, not all of the synergies flow to the bottom line as we invest in the long-term health of the business
For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect flat input costs, but we also expect a more competitive pricing environment given overall protein availability
Something very important to me, in seeing our company along its path to achieving its fullest growth potential is investing in our facilities to support that growth
As such, I want to make you aware of an important investment initiative we've undertaken that will affect the Prepared Foods segment for approximately 18 months
Within Prepared Foods, we have two well-developed businesses in both retail and food service channels
These channels are complementary in reaching all consumers
Our scale in both channels provides a natural volume hedge as consumer eating behavior shifts between channels
This leadership position is increasingly critical as channels blur chasing rapidly growing convenience and on-the-go occasions as exemplified by the rise of e-commerce meal kits
Our retail channel consists of primarily category-defining branded products and is propelled by industry-leading marketing capabilities as well as a well-supported asset base
It has gross margins as robust as any in the industry and growth rates that lead the industry
The food service channel is also characterized by industry-leading share positions across more than 10 categories
In contrast to retail, in food service, we play in primarily unbranded price-driven categories that are highly competitive and can be volatile as they absorb swings in commodity
These category and channel positions are strategically important for long-term growth, but generally operate at margins below those realized by our retail brands
Network investments to upgrade capacity and throughput for long-term growth have increased the cost structure in our plants that serve the food service channel and further pressured margins
As the capacity investments translate into improved efficiency and volume growth over the next 18 months, these pressures will abate, but in the interim they will continue to compress margins possibly dropping the segment below 10% return on sales for the year and around 9% for the second quarter
Let's now turn to a view on total company growth
Our sales volume across all segments rolled up to 2.4% growth
Our retail channel showed the most volume growth in the company versus Q1 last year with a 6.6% increase
IRI data for the 13-week period corresponding with our Q1 showed Tyson Foods, both Core 9 and all Tyson products sold at retail, were leading sales volume and sales dollar growth among retail food manufacturers
As you'll see in the slides posted on our website this morning, we were only – we were, of the top 10 branded food-only companies, the only one with positive sales volume and one of only two companies with positive sales dollar growth
For the most recent 13-week period, IRI reported total Tyson retail volume was up 6%
Core 9 volume was also up 6% with 1.2 points of share gain
Despite the deflationary pricing environment, dollar sales were up 2% for total Tyson and 3% in the Core 9. Our retail branded business experienced continued strong growth in the quarter behind base business momentum, excellent retail execution around the holidays and new product launches
The Hillshire Farm brand drove growth across smoked sausage, lunchmeat and cocktail links categories
Jimmy Dean's Stuffed Hash Browns, Jimmy Dean Delights Frittatas, Hillshire Snacking, and Tyson Premium Select Nuggets are examples of innovations that are meeting or exceeding our expectations
We continued improving ROI on our advertising spend behind new campaigns utilizing more precise media buying and effective advertising execution
I should note, we're about to start lapping some more difficult comparisons in the next few months, our growth however should still outpace the industry
In our food service channel, Q1 volume was flat to slightly up in an environment of three consecutive quarters of declining food service traffic as consumers moved towards retail channels
Our segmentation strategy and advantaged customer positions mean a large share of our volume is in accounts where their sales are outperforming industry traffic trends
This can be seen in the performance of some critical food service categories and will set us up well for long-term growth
On our Q4 call, we introduced new analytics to give you some insight into our broad line distribution portion of our food service channel, which serves predominantly local and regional food service operators
These analytics, based on NPD Supply Track data follow five critical broad line categories prioritized for growth
These categories are value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, bacon and pizza toppings
Like our Core 9 or retail, these are key indicators of the overall health of our protein businesses within food service distribution
Our Focus 5 categories grew volumes 12% in October, the most recent data available
With more work to do, we are pleased with our progress in the Focus 5. In our earnings call in November, we talked about the investments we're making in innovation, consumer insights and brands
At our CAGNY Presentation on February 21, we'll do a deep dive on those efforts and share with you examples of our innovation pipeline
The opportunities we see for long-term growth and how we're inventing new solutions to meet the evolving needs of consumers and customers are exciting
Another investment we have made for the long-term health of our company is in our people, and I want to provide some insight on what this means and the scope
As a part of the integration of Hillshire brands, we standardized the holiday and vacation policies across the company and transitioned to a singular competitive compensation structure
This incremental expense of $58 million in Q1 impacted Chicken by $23 million and Prepared Foods by $22 million
The investment is front-loaded in our fiscal year with a lesser impact later in the year and was not adjusted out of our reported earnings
While it is a significant amount of money, it's imperative to invest in our team members for long-term growth and stability
We want to keep Tyson Foods as a preferred place to work with a compensation package that attracts and retains the best people in the industry
We're investing where it matters, while heightening our focus on lean and continuous improvement to provide fuel for these investments
We are becoming more disciplined at driving out non-value-added costs across the company to focus our precious resources on growth
There will be significant dollars attached to those cost savings and I plan to be more descriptive about this in the future
So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis to walk you through our financial results
Good morning
Let me talk about growth overall, then we can talk about sort of EPS over time
You know, yes, we are going to – we will be making investments for the future of the company in terms of growth, but we are also going to deliver growth in 2017. So, you know, it's key, it's our quarter (21:13) – our fiber, it's our story
We are consistent
We want sustainable growth
That's our objective
And I'll say a few things
One, you know, we continue to invest where we want to grow and we're demonstrating growth on value-added products versus the commodity elements of our portfolio, and I'd say that's particularly in Chicken and Prepared Foods we see that very prominently
Beef and Pork are also benefiting from livestock supply and very strong markets, but I would say, Chicken and Prepared Foods is where you'll find us investing heavily
Prepared Foods is in a fantastic position to take advantage of innovation and brand strength
We've seen the results of the innovation coming through volume, and we are prepared at CAGNY to show you some pretty fantastic progress we've made on our innovation pipeline
So as it relates to, Heather, the EPS growth expectations, you know, the range that we're guiding to now puts us in the 12% to 15% for this year
Ongoing, that's, you know, where we've talked about continuing to guide as a high single digits EPS growth, and you know, I'll turn it over to Dennis for anything else you want to add there
Correct
Without giving you specific guidance for 2018, I mean that's too far away for us, what I'd say is we're making the right investments for growth
If you think about the Prepared Foods business, it's really, like I said, two separate businesses
Predominantly in the legacy Tyson organization, it was a food service business and in the legacy Hillshire business, it was about 75% retail, 25% food service
The margin profiles are very different in those businesses
The assets were in different condition
And, so going forward, we want the mix to turn out to be as profitable growth – continuing profitable growth within the 10% to 12% range
However, we have some work to do as it relates to supporting those assets that serve the food service business
Growth, we feel really strong about in the long-term, and like I said, we'll talk more about that at CAGNY
Ken, if we deliver low double-digits, that's going to be awesome
But we're focused on high single-digits, because for us, we believe to continue the growth algorithm of this company, we have to invest
We're going to simultaneously invest
We're going to also amp up our continuous improvement program as I talked about
That feels like the right place for us to continue to drive growth, Dennis
Yeah, no, I got it, great question
We're constantly paranoid about avian influenza, because it's certainly is something that can wreak havoc on our company
What I'd say is, 2015, we amped up our bio-security
We had good bio-security to begin with, but we amped it up to an all-time high level of discipline and scrutiny, frankly, and it hasn't stopped
And so, that we feel confident about our position, and right now it appears to be, as you called out, a non-U.S
issue, but certainly we remain diligent in our efforts to make sure Tyson is protected
Yeah, really it's too small an issue at this point
Yeah, you're welcome
Good morning
Agreed
Yeah, so, Jeremy, as we talked about synergies, the one thing we need to come back to is those numbers that we have continue to talk about, those are gross numbers and there's a lot of expenses beneath that that, you know, net out to a smaller number, and there's a significant amount of investment that we are making in the cost base for sure
The way I'd have you think about it is that, yes, predominantly those have gone to make it more attractive margin in the business, but that's something that will continue on
So as we stop the sort of synergy discussion, we're going to continue to talk about lean and continuous improvement, that's going to, you know, provide the fuel for growth for the business
Over time, we expect margin expansion
We talked about 10% being the number that we're comfortable with right now
But you should expect margin to expand toward the higher end of that range and continue to experience greater than industry growth
Yeah
It will be, you know, our guidance is in that upper-end of the normalized range, 9% to 11%
We expect it to be growing in both, you know, Frozen and Fresh segments
What I'd say is, you know, we're taking advantage of the low cost of raw materials right now and we've added cooking capacity, which is – we don't talk about that a lot, but that is something that we have made tremendous progress on, as we've added capacity, we've sold that capacity and so we're in a position where we're, you know, looking to add more capacity
So the mix is improving
We're focused on reducing the cost structure as you call out, but we continue to see that we're doing the right things in that business, and outside of a massive grain shock, we feel like we're in a great, great position
Yeah, sure
You know, pricing is competitive
There's a lot of protein available, so pricing is a big effect, Adam
And, you know, that's not going to abate in the near term, and we see that being an issue that's hanging with us
We also see, as we've discussed, some of those costs rolling through
Now, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's mostly the one-time nature that has rolled through, but that is something that we are investing in to make sure that the margin holds up over time
But I'd say the biggest thing that we're facing right now is just pricing as it relates to overall availability
Yeah
Q2 is always a tough quarter for us to understand exactly how it's going to play out given the seasonality of our business
But I would say it's not just on the Fresh Meat side that there's tremendous seasonality as it relates to the poultry and Prepared Foods side as well
So we feel like Q2 will be challenged and we think Q3 and Q4 will be strong
Now, we're guiding to what we believe, based on what we know today, those are the numbers we feel confident about and we'll see how it plays out, but it's a lot depends on how Q2 rolls
After
You're welcome
Yeah, I'm going to – I'll tackle the first one, and Dennis could probably provide some color on the second part of that, Rob
You know, the difference between last year and this year is just the pricing for us that we're into the marketplace with
I mean, it's what we're focused on as we talked repeatedly is about making sure that we're continuing to put ourselves in a position where we're growing volume
So, think about that value-added growth of 5% that comes making sure that we're entirely competitive, so that is the reason why, year over-year, you're not seeing the same margin structure, but you're seeing the maintained growth
Dennis, do you want to comment on that?
Absolutely
Yeah, pricing pressure, think about Prepared Foods, our portfolio, it is predominantly protein and it plays in the same space, same dynamics, so absolutely we have been more aggressive for sure
Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
You're welcome
Sure, Akshay
The way to think about it is we have to come to one system across Tyson Foods which is not a unusual thing for companies to make sure that they're doing that in a thoughtful way
As we did it, we said that the right thing to do was to get to a point where we have compelling packages for our team across the organization
For the year, we expect it's going to be about $100 million in total charges
The $58 million that hit Q1, I spoke about, about 80% of that is one-time in nature, and the costs for the rest of the year, they flow through
But I would say that the recurring cost structure increase is less than the accounting true-up for the first quarter and it does make a lot of sense for us to focus on making sure that we have a one-Tyson system as it relates to compensation
No, it was getting to one system on holidays and vacations and because we were so different across both, that was the key issue
Yeah, and I think it's fair to say that the business has always been on the, as you call it, on the legacy Tyson side, it's been a challenging business from a margin perspective
If we look at the 2014 results, it was a loss maker
2013, it was about 3%
I think the 5.5 % was one-time that was, I believe, 2012. But if you look at the business year-over-year for the legacy Tyson team, it was a business that was challenged from a margin perspective
So when you're flowing through with the addition of Hillshire, there are some – the blend-out is going to be somewhat less
As it relates to your question about the investing in the business, yes, we have continued to invest and part of that or I would say the majority of that, as it relates to synergies, have been closing some plants that were non-strategic as we consolidated volume into existing plants that we're heavily investing in
That sometimes goes really well
Sometimes it wasn't executed exactly as we had drawn up on the white board
However, what I would say is, the investments that we're making now are pointed towards growing the business and improving the margins
And so, that's as clear as I could put it, Akshay
Yeah
So the – we're just getting the number, the percentage of the top of my head, I don't know what that is
You can maybe follow-up with that, Jon, to the extent that we're going to share it
What I would say is, we are making tremendous impact on our business in food service on poultry
So our Prepared or further processed business in poultry is going extremely well in food service, and we are making sure that those categories we want to play long-term are going to be healthy
Now, where that growth is going to be sourced from, there's a lot of channel shifting as I talked about
But if you think about the periphery of the grocery store, our customers are looking for solutions that are not necessarily retail packaged brands, but they are ready to consume
You might have heard this term gross around
There's a lot of – our customers that are looking to capture food service volume, we are in the sweet spot of that space, because our solutions are exactly what they're looking for and our expertise is what they want to leverage
So, I'll say, and thinking growth for the future, food service will come from the traditional channels that it does, that you know of, but I also would ask you to think about that periphery of the store being a real sweet spot for us
Good morning
Yes, yes, it is
That is going to be a part of what's going to continue to hang with us here, but we wanted to make an improvement in our network
We went down that path
We made a good decision to close a plant that was not fit for the business, but the production was transferred to the newer facilities
It was absolutely the right decision to position us for growth, and we just have more work to do
The transition wasn't seamless, like I said, but we feel like that we're on path to make that a long-term healthy strong business for us, both in terms of Prepared Foods growth and also the margin structure
Yeah, so Farha, I won't give you the forward-looking marketing investments, but what I will tell you is we are doing two things that you should hold us accountable to
One is making sure that that investment continues to improve its return
So we are doing some fabulous work on our team to make sure ROI continues to go up on marketing investments
And so if the ROI is increasing and we're making the right moves in supporting our branded businesses, we would expect the overall to continue to go up
So, if we're getting a good return on that, we want to support the brands, and you know, it depends on which brand you're talking about, what the ultimate level is, the mix-out is going to be different depending upon what kind of traction we've got
Clearly, we're going to spending and have spent a lot more on the Tyson brands and we're going to continue to spend on the other brands that we have the number one position
So it's what's required, certainly our customers expect that
And like I said, we're going to get nice returns on those investments
Okay
Let me take that as a follow-up
We'll talk to Jon to see if we can get you some more detail around that that we're willing to share
And I mean part of it we feel like we have a competitive advantage in that area and want to make sure we thread that needle correctly
But I would ask Jon to follow up with you, Farah
Yeah, awesome
So, you know, I really thought we'd be going out of limb talking about 2018. What we see are, you know, certainly in the regions where we are – we'd like how it's shaping up
2017 looks to have better numbers, let's say, cattle in our regions, which is great
Our cattle inventory, we feel like – if you look at it compared to 2011 and 2012, this year, it's similar – its improving to that level
And, you know, we feel like for our position going into 2018, it's teeing up well, but it's just too far out there to know
You know, 2018 cattle are born in 2016, and we're kind of, you know, trying to model that ourselves
But we feel great about 2018. I can't give you a view, I'm sorry
I'll just go back and say, 2017 looks better than last year, and the Midwest, more cattle coming
We like that
We believed for the year we're at 5%, just the level that we're feeling like we'll wind up at
And it's hard to tell, but I would say, we're shaping up well
You're welcome
No
So, as I've said before, the Georgia Dock for Tyson Foods is a tempest in a teapot
It's really not something that drives a lot of our attention
Since the elimination of the mechanism last month, customers that are affected are being switched to other methods, so no impact on margin
We've told you that in the past we have various pricing mechanisms
It's really supply and demand that our customers are looking at, what's the overall protein availability, how do they feel like they have leverage
Certainly, as we're continuing to grow the branded business more of that is on a list price
We have certainly some businesses that are formula driven, but predominantly on grains, so that's what I'd ask you to think about
And the diversity of those pricing mechanisms for us tells us it's important for us, because it helps us de-risk the total margin profile
But as it relates to the Georgia Dock, no impact
You're welcome
Absolutely, we will continue to flex our buy versus grow strategy
We try to grow whole-bird increments to remind everybody and we buy pieces
So the parts that we need we're going to continue to buy on the market when the market is favorable, but that's our model
And that's what we feel really strong about to continue our growth is to make sure that we're making sure what we're producing internally is in whole-bird increments
About 80% of the $58 million, so let's just round it up to about $50 million
Ken, the 2017, whatever we have teed up to invest in 2017 is in our guidance, it's in the capital plan
This is, you know, we've been working on this for some time
As it relates to rolling forward beyond 2017, simultaneously, we're amping up our continuous improvement program
So investments that we're going to make in the business, we know that there needs to be a paid for (51:24)
So that is what we intend to do, so it's not going to be incremental
I would ask you to think about it as it's going to be offset by continued improvement in our continuous improvement efforts and discipline
So that's how I think about it
I will have Jon follow-up with you
We can do the math together and
2017 is continuing to be a number where – we are going to grow in 2017 and we believe that, of course, it's going to be a base for us to grow into the future
But, you know, that's not – we want to make sure that we are continuing to grow while we're investing, that's a trick, and that's what we want to do for, you know, all of our stakeholders, make sure we're doing that really, really well
Absolutely
Yeah, I'd say, Heather, it's not the cuts so much as it is the businesses that, I'd say, apply to
So if you think about the retail business, it operates in a typical CPG model, where we are looking at supply/demand, the strength of the brands, elasticities to make the right calls on what's the best thing for us to do as it relates to pricing
The food service, the raw material, generally flows through on a formula price
There's always – we're looking to make sure that we have the right balance, but it's slower
There's a almost – about 70% of the raw material gets passed on
But those funds will continue to – that we – when we capture – certainly, margin momentum are going to be continuing to be focused on innovation
The particular cuts isn't so much how we think about it
Now, with the exception of bellies
Of course, bellies has been a particularly volatile raw material right now and that's something that we continue to make sure that we're doing the right thing for, the right brand, as well as our Jimmy Dean brand business
And that's probably the area that gets the most attention right now
The rest of the commodity inputs or cost inputs are something that is – we feel like we've got a pretty good handle on
Bellies are domestic
Hams, I think, as it relates to another, probably volatile, component, are export predominantly
So the rest of the trim and those items that we buy for retail and food service, food service moves typically on a formula, retail does not
There's generally a lag effect up and down
Absolutely
You're welcome
Great
Thanks for all the wonderful questions
Appreciate all those, and before I sign off I just wanted to say we had, of course, an excellent overall financial performance in Q1 we're thrilled by, and as a team we're continuing to raise the bar for ourselves
We have a tremendous amount of excitement about the future; precisely because we know we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of room for growth
We've got great capabilities
We play in great categories
We have a great team that knows how to win
And as you think about our business, just know that we're always thinking about value creation; it's on our minds every day
Creating shared value for all of our stakeholders, our investors and everybody in the team and it's through hard work and determination we'll get it done
So, just thanks again
Appreciate your interest in Tyson Foods and we're looking forward to growing together
