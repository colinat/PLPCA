0,"Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us"
1,"With me to review Kroger’s second quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman"
2,"As you know, Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years"
3,"Our success over time boils down to one thing, our relentless focus on the customer"
4,That focus allows us to deepen our connection with customers and create shareholder value
5,The customer remains the center of everything we do
6,The four core elements of our Customer 1st Strategy are as relevant today as they were when we first introduced them
7,How we invest each year to drive customer engagement changes regularly based on customers’ changing needs and wants
8,"This showed in our second quarter results, as we returned to positive identical supermarket sales growth, and both loyal and total households increased"
9,"Traffic was up, unit movement was up and market share was up"
10,Our customers’ perception of our prices is excellent and we continue to get even better
11,"Based on our second quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we have confirmed our annual net earnings guidance"
12,The operating environment will continue to be incredibly dynamic
13,"But more importantly, customer behavior is changing faster than ever before"
14,"For the last few quarters we’ve talked with you about our expanded view of all the food our customers eat, and how we’ve been working to redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores"
15,"We know that the massive, $1.5 trillion U.S"
16,food market creates a unique and sustainable growth opportunity for Kroger
17,You’ll see changes in the way we go to market as a leading indicator of the lens through which we view our market
18,We see anyone who sells food as competitors in the future
19,"Kroger has a history of successfully evolving to meet our customers’ changing needs, because we put the customer at the center of everything we do"
20,"We are transforming today, too"
21,"We are reprioritizing and accelerating investments in our Customer 1st Strategy in order to anticipate and meet rapidly-evolving consumer demands to shop with us for anything, anytime, anywhere"
22,Our transformation is all about redefining the customer experience
23,"As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance for 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018 as well"
24,"In this dynamic operating environment, we will continue to provide annual guidance as we have done for many years but will no longer provide longer-term guidance"
25,This will provide needed flexibility in how we invest to position us for the future success
26,We look forward to getting into the details of our goals and priorities at our upcoming investor conference in October
27,"But in the meantime, I’d like to begin to create a vision by sharing several ways we are redefining the customer experience to be America’s inspiration and destination for everything food"
28,We’re doing this by combining our knowledge of food and our ability to personalize through the use of data analytics; we’re doubling down on digital; and we’re leveraging new and ongoing partnerships to deepen our connection with customers and drive revenue
29,I’ll take a few moments to share more about each of these areas where we have deep credibility from our past and are aggressively developing for our future
30,"Food retailing is more exciting than ever before, especially as more of us become foodies"
31,"Customers have nearly an unlimited number of options when you combine tastes, flavors and types of meals with the growing number of food outcomes that consumers are focused on"
32,"Those outcomes might include eating for health or for enjoyment, for example, or for lifestyle or performance reasons"
33,Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner our customers turn to for their meal needs because we know food and we know our customers better than anyone
34,Meals have always been our expertise
35,Kroger is often the one driving change and innovation behind the scenes
36,"We are very proud of the role we’ve played for over a decade in making natural and organic products more affordable and accessible to America, especially for shoppers on a budget"
37,We’ve always believed that our customers shouldn’t have to pay higher prices just because a product is natural or organic
38,"We developed our Simple Truth brand to be honest, easy and affordable because our data told us this was a great customer need in the marketplace"
39,"Today, Simple Truth is the biggest natural and organic brand in the country by volume"
40,This market continues to provide a robust opportunity for Kroger
41,"Similarly, our culinary innovation team is bringing truly affordable and incredibly tasty meal kits to American households through our Prep+Pared offering"
42,"Just last week, we announced that we are expanding our offering of Prep+Pared to more than 50 stores in three of our divisions, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Ralphs"
43,"Across Kroger, we know our customers better than anyone"
44,We have a 13-year advantage of using data insights to connect with customers
45,"Data analytics are fully integrated in our business, as 84.51° helps us make merchandising, operations and marketing decisions"
46,"In the last year alone, Kroger has made more than 3 billion personalized recommendations to customers through product offers, promotions, recipes and more"
47,Data analytics is helping us win with Our Brands by identifying the best products to bring to market based on consumer behavior and taste trends
48,Research by an independent third party shows us that our customers favor Our Brands over national brands and competitor offerings
49,"The strength of Our Brands is what our customers realize Kroger quality is superior, and at a very affordable price"
50,It truly is quality without compromise
51,Customers get the best and most innovative quality at the best prices
52,We will build this momentum to be the premier private label destination in America
53,Combining our love of food with our data expertise allows us to offer content that inspires
54,We recently launched a new My Recipes feature on Kroger
55,com that serves up a personalized selection of suggested recipes
56,"The recipes offer greater diversity of meal ideas, all based on your individual purchase behavior"
57,"Our growing collection of recipes is also searchable by a variety of filters including seasonality, world cuisine, meal or dish type, and cooking style"
58,"While online recipes are not new, serving them up on a personalized recipe for your family is and customer and your family will love the new offerings"
59,And this is distinctly Kroger
60,"Personalized recipes are just one example on how we are bringing the combination of food and data together to create new and highly-relevant customer experiences, especially through digital and ecommerce"
61,Customers expect a great shopping experience and the ability to interact with us digitally or online in a seamless way
62,"Our digital efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personal, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs"
63,"This includes our mobile app, for example, in addition to Vitacost"
64,"com, ClickList, Express Lane and home delivery"
65,"Today, we have more than 25 million digital customer accounts"
66,"As we said in our press release, our total digital sales are up 126%, driven by ClickList"
67,We operate more than 813 ClickList and Express Lane locations offering the convenience of online ordering and curbside pickup
68,"By the end of the year, we will offer the service at more than 1,000 locations"
69,Customers continue to respond exceptionally well to ClickList
70,"We know that in the future more customers will want the option of home delivery, so we are also testing various home delivery models with companies like Uber and Shipt and on our own in more than 150 stores"
71,"We will keep making the strategic investments to serve customers anything, anytime and anywhere in the near future"
72,"With new entrants in a fragmented market, we’re also transforming our business and building partnerships to deepen our relationship with, and create value for, our customers"
73,"We’ve been preparing for new market entrants for years, and the fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households annually is a great strength when customers have more food choices than ever before"
74,"We continue to gain share in key categories like natural foods, produce and fresh prepared foods"
75,We will continue to focus on growing our core business to generate free cash flow and deepen our personal connection with customers
76,These changes also create opportunities to work with our existing partners to deliver more value for customers and to identify new partnerships to create alternative revenue streams
77,"Now, here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to walk you through changes to our capital allocation process and long-term guidance"
78,Mike?
79,"Thanks, Mike"
80,"I’m often reminded of the saying, “may you live in interesting times”"
81,"These are interesting times in our industry, and I know some of you wonder how Kroger can continue to thrive in such a dynamic operating environment"
82,We have a history of evolving to meet our customers’ ever-changing needs
83,The key is to proactively see where the customer is going and to proactively address the changes
84,That is what we are doing today
85,"Through innovation, Kroger is redefining the food and grocery customer experience based on our core strengths"
86,"Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization"
87,We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within one-to-two miles of our customers
88,We have a leadership team that combines deep experience with creative new talent
89,We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually
90,"In fact, we’ve been named America’s most beloved grocery store several times"
91,We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program
92,"And, we have a track record of connecting with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives, as evidenced by our team’s response to Hurricane Harvey"
93,"Now, we look forward to your questions"
94,Question-and-Answer Session
95,"Currently quarter-to-date, and this is without the hurricane effects, we would be above where we finished the second quarter and we would be closer to the high side of the guidance range"
96,"The reason we exclude the hurricane is because one day it’s a positive, one day it’s not because of obviously one day you will have business that’s up 100% or 200% and the next day it’s basically zero"
97,"So, we just -- until we get completely through the two hurricanes and when we release third quarter, we will obviously give a lot more insight"
98,"But so far, we would be trending ahead of second quarter and closer to the top end of the range"
99,"And on changing the range, as Mike mentioned, if we left the range the same as it was before, it could have meant, we would have had positive -- negative identical, excuse me, for the second half of the year"
100,"And obviously, we wanted to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect identicals to be positive and the trends that we’re seeing so far, the identicals continue to improve"
101,"In terms of how much it encompasses, it would be everything that you mentioned plus some"
102,And as Mike mentioned in his comments on the space optimization 84.51° is helping us look across the whole store and how do we use space
103,"So, obviously, in some cases, it’s continuation of adding more fresh space"
104,"It’s also in terms of the products that we offer to the customer, every single item has to earn its right to be on the shelf and categories have to earn the right to have certain amount of allocation"
105,"So, it’s all of those things"
106,The expense would really be driven by two things
107,"One, when you make some changes, there are some equipments that you would write off"
108,"As you make the changes, there is certainly the labor and the cost in doing the changes, plus some of the equipment gets written off almost immediately"
109,"So, it’s both of those factors that is behind what Mike was mentioning"
110,"I would say, the broad comment would be, from an M&A standpoint, we would be equally as excited today as two years ago, when we find the right person to partner with"
111,"And as you know, when we look for someone to partner, we’re looking at somebody that brings things to us as much as we bring to them"
112,We would continue to be aggressively looking at anything digital that adds capabilities
113,"You may recall, in the past year and a half or so, we merged with a company called Market6 and another company called You Tech"
114,"And we were able to use in both of those situations, the 84.51° and accelerate the work that they did and accelerate some of the work that we’re doing plus brought a great amount of talent to our Company"
115,"So, we would increasingly look at curtain capabilities that somebody would bring to us and how do you partner with them in a way that would bring that capability"
116,"But for the right merger opportunity, whether it’s digital or physical, we would be as excited today as two years ago, but it would obviously have to be somebody that fit in well with where we operate and has a business that’s strong"
117,"Well, as you mentioned, Ken, it’s only been a week and a half, so it’s very early in the process"
118,"And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we’re really proud of the work that we started over a decade ago, and making sure natural and organic product is affordable to all customers, and we never felt like just because something is natural or organic, you should charge a premium for it"
119,"In terms of the impact, obviously, it’s way early, but there isn’t anything that would cause you to develop any point of view at all, in terms of changing trends, but it’s only been a week and a half"
120,"So, I would caveat it a million different ways"
121,"Obviously, the discussion around it has been longer than that"
122,"I don’t think -- I actually don’t look at two-year stacks very much, because I sold whatever I sold last year and I’m selling that plus more this year"
123,And we feel very good about the underlying health of our business
124,"As we said in the prepared remarks and in response to questions so far, ID sales so far in the quarter are pushing the high end of the guidance range"
125,"We grew loyal households, we grew total households, we have strong market share growth and strong tonnage growth"
126,"And I would also remind you that as our brands continue to gain strength and gain a bigger share of both units and sales that comes at the expense of a lower retail ring, which winds up being a bit of a headwind to reported ID sales"
127,And we have been very aggressive with how we position those products inside of our stores
128,It’s a great question and it’s hard to answer because the thing that we’re trying to do for our customers is to do it in a way that’s totally seamless
129,"So, the customer continues to come into the store and shop, so we actually get more of their total basket"
130,"So, it’s helping comps but it’s helping comps from that total customer household and how much they’re spending with us"
131,"So, it’s helping identicals but it’s really hard to say ClickList is X percent of it or Y percent of it"
132,"I don’t know, Mike, anything want to add?"
133,I’ll give a little bit broader answer than just your question
134,"First of all, we would talk about it in terms of our brands versus private label, because from -- and it’s something that took us longer than it should have"
135,"But, if those brands, they are our brands and the customers tell us they love it and one of the things that we probably should have done years ago but we hadn’t but we actually, was much more aggressive on hiring a third-party company to do a broad test taste and quality preferences for our brands across multiple national brands and other companies’ private label programs"
136,And we always thought we were good but we came out even significantly better than what we would have even thought
137,"So, it really highlighted the progress that our team has been making on improving the innovation in our brands, the variety of offerings"
138,"If you look at Simple Truth, obviously five years ago it didn’t exist; today, it continues to grow double digits"
139,"So, when you look at overall, our customers tell us they love our brands"
140,"And we continue to even get more aggressive in terms of creating additional innovation, brands, offerings within, new flavors"
141,"In terms of the potential, at this point, the only thing that I would say is it’s -- would be massive"
142,"And one of the things that we did several years ago, we went to the outside and hired a new leader for that team and about half of our team is from the outside"
143,"And when you go and look at Europe, obviously, on the Our Brand product in Europe, the market shares there are significantly higher than the U.S"
144,"And we would be much more focused on how do we make sure the innovation, the quality and the offerings that we have, we earn the right for the customers to take it to that kind of level"
145,"In terms of our plant capacity, if you asked our manufacturing team, they would probably tell you they’re at almost capacity"
146,I’ve always found and we’ve always found that we always figure out ways to produce incremental product and do it very efficiently
147,"So, in terms of capacity, it is one of the great things about knowing how to operate plants, we could easily expand capacity, either through process change or additional expanding plants, things like that, whether is needed"
148,Not at this point
149,"I don’t know, Mike, if you -- not at this point"
150,"As you know, we are continuing to provide a little bit more insight than before"
151,"Yes, On the crossover with Walmart on digital, I actually don’t know the answer to that"
152,"And it’s incredibly easy to develop a shopping list with us, the work that our teams have done working with 84.51°"
153,"We do a lot of work on predicting what your shopping list will be, to make it really easy to do"
154,The one insight that I can give you and we’ll have to go back and look to see the overlap on Walmart is -- our success on ClickList is very consistent across the country
155,You don’t see one place where it’s 1% and somewhere else it’s a 100% variance of success
156,It’s pretty consistent
157,"On the Lidl, obviously, they continue to open stores"
158,"So far, what they’ve done has been pretty consistent with what we expected"
159,"And obviously, you’ve heard us talk about from a pricing standpoint, we won’t lose on price; we’re not trying to lead the market down on price, but we are not going to lose on price"
160,"The success so far in terms of being able to maintain our business and grow our business, we feel very good about the ability to compete against all the Lidl and anybody else"
161,"So, I wouldn’t say there has been any surprises so far"
162,"Obviously, they are our great competitor but there is a lot of great competitors out there"
163,"Well, as everybody on the call knows, we make our investment decisions in terms of what do we think is best for our business three to five years out and which intern means what’s best for our shareholders three to five years out"
164,There is no doubt that ClickList is a headwind on earnings currently and we’ve even continued to accelerate the speed in which we put ClickList in
165,"And so, it’s incremental headwind"
166,"We feel very comfortable, when you look at it over a three to five-year period of time"
167,Our customers will appreciate that we offer ClickList; our associates obviously in terms of being able to provide the service will be glad; and our shareholders will be glad
168,"So, we can clearly see where we’re -- there is a path where we’re indifferent on whether somebody comes into the store or shops with us on ClickList"
169,It’s you have initial paying and that would be a -- of what caused to affect the long-term guidance perspective
170,I would say it’s fairly common or fairly traditional time of a transition
171,"It’s just at anytime you go from higher prices to lower prices, the thing that gets disruptive is how quickly will people lower prices and then the flip is the case as inflation creeps back in, how quickly will people adjust prices the other direction, to continue to protect the gross margin dollars that they would have in those products"
172,And that’s what causes the disruption in the short run as you’re cycling through the two of those
173,"I would say broad based, there isn’t anything that’s really out of the realm of what you normally see"
174,The one exception to that would be what we talked about earlier in the year relative to some low milk prices earlier in the year and eggs continue to be pretty inexpensive as well
175,"But, those would probably be the only two categories that I would hold out as maybe exceptions to the norm right now"
176,"The other thing that we have such great relationships with local agencies, almost always we would be considered part of the first responder group, because people understand that it’s important for the glossary stores to get stocks"
177,"So, our associates would be given clearance as a first responder in most cases"
178,"One CPGs, as you know, we always work with CPG partners, trying to understand how we grow our business on a combined basis"
179,"So, both of us are very focused on growing the business"
180,"I think CPGs continue to aggressively, incrementally try to work with us on helping grow their business"
181,It’s one of the things that’s nice about having the great insight we have with 84.51°
182,We partner with most CPGs in a different and more deep way that also involves product innovation
183,"So, there is no doubt, there is tremendous amount of change going on, the CPGs feel that change, and we’re working with the CPGs for both of us to grow our business"
184,"But, obviously, we’re also working and focusing on growing our business as well"
185,"Outside of that, I really wouldn’t say that it’s -- there has been a massive trend change, what do they always say in economics, all short statements are wrong"
186,"So, you give the scenario and I can find it somewhere"
187,The biggest change would be -- continue to be milk and eggs across the country; everywhere else would be puts and takes
188,The biggest thing that the 84.51° insight shows us is the customer decides where to shop based on their total experience
189,"And obviously that total experience is what’s the shopping environment like, so what’s how the associates treat the customer"
190,"What kind of rewards do you have, what type of personalized offers are you making, which is very hard for anybody to see that other than each one of us as a customer individually"
191,"And then, obviously from fresh product standpoint having great produce, meat, deli, dinner tonight, these kind of things"
192,"So, the thing that’s really important is the all of that together, the price, the specific price items, really each one of us would have different items that are in our biggest hot button"
193,"So, it would be factoring in all of those things in terms of how we decide where to price and how to price"
194,"And the insights, the biggest part of the insights is, it really is important to customers for their over total experience not just one dimension of the experience"
195,Yes
196,"On the milk and eggs, I just -- I didn’t -- the comment I made, I didn’t intend to infer that it changed anything from the first quarter in terms of broadening out or narrowing or anything on milk and eggs"
197,What was the second part of your question?
198,"Well, I guess, I would broaden it"
199,"We feel good about the pricing investments that we make and based on what the customers’ telling us, it continues to connect as we expected"
200,And it’s -- we feel good about it when you look at everything in total
201,"Also in some of the costs -- operating costs categories, the second quarter trends improved versus the first quarter as well"
202,"We feel very strongly that we would expect additional consolidation going forward and the consolidation will happen the way you describe, plus other ways in terms of companies merging and other thing"
203,"So, we don’t think there is any doubt that you’ll continue to see a lot of consolidation"
204,"You’ve always heard us talk about -- anything that happens, you should assume that we’ve looked at it"
205,"And if you look at what we did with Marsh, obviously those work out really well for us, because of specific trade areas that we haven’t been able to get into"
206,"And by buying some stores from somebody in that situation, you’re able to get into trade areas and leverage all your existing infrastructure"
207,"Those we always like, but they’re lumpy"
208,"So, you won’t have any for a couple of years and then you’ll have a whole bunch of them happen"
209,"But, those are once that we will always be interested in and always take a look at"
210,"But, you should assume that our overall view on the merging with somebody is the same and we continue to look at stuff"
211,"If you look at natural and organic overall, it’s over $16 billion business for us on an annual basis"
212,"So, obviously, it’s an important part of our business"
213,It continues to grow strongly and we would continue to see a great opportunity in that space
214,We find more and more customers
215,"For some items, they will purchase natural organic items and other places, they will buy traditional items"
216,"And for us, what we try to do is, we don’t judge a customer on how they eat, and we try to make sure we have what the customer wants at a great value"
217,"In terms of the share of market, it depends on how you define share of market"
218,"If you look at Simple Truth, last year it was about a 1.7 billion category for us"
219,And if you look at the $16 billion in total that would obviously include some non-branded meat items and other items
220,"So, that would give you some insight in terms of share of market"
221,"If you look at grocery overall, grocery typically on units is close to 30%"
222,"So, obviously, there is still a lot of room to grow"
223,"When you look at total, we get more of the customers business and that’s what we find the reason why we are so supportive and keep working on it"
224,"In terms of the share of business, at this point, we wouldn’t give the specifics on stores and what percentage of their business is in ClickList"
225,It’s a reasonably wide range
226,And the range isn’t driven by anything that -- it’s more specific stores
227,"So, I know one store that has a pretty high percentage, it’s right off the interstate, so that store has gained a lot of new customers because it’s easy on and easy off, the interstate and their trade area for ClickList is completely different than their trade area for the store"
228,"For us, what we’ve tried to design is a business model that we know at certain percentage of business it’s more efficient to do it in store because of not having incremental asset investment"
229,"At the point in time that it grows, it’s easily converted to dark stores or a freestanding warehouse facility where you put in more automation"
230,"So, what we’ve tried to do is design where we can support and partner and make money and the customers will take it to whatever percentage of our business they take it and we’ll be there for them as they go"
231,"So, we’ve really worked hard on having a model that’s easily scalable and scalable in terms of what percent of penetration it becomes"
232,"So, thanks Alvin"
233,Okay
234,"Thanks, Alvin"
235,Thanks to everyone on the call
236,"Obviously -- hopefully you hear some of the comments that Mike and I are making, Kroger is playing to win"
237,And the things that we do are what we believe will be best when you look out three to five years for our customers and associates
238,"And what we’ve always found, when we do both of those, then, our shareholders are well rewarded as well"
239,And the business continues to generate great free cash flow and we have great opportunities in front of us
240,"So, and then one other comment, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates that are listening in"
241,"First of all, I would like to send our well wishes to the people of Huston and especially members of our Kroger family whose lives have been turned upside down by the recent hurricane and its aftermath"
242,Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are now bracing for Hurricane Irma as well
243,"Since the rains stopped in Houston, you have shown nothing can stop the strength, resilience and power of our amazing associates"
244,"Many of you stayed in or couldn’t easily leave stores, distribution centers, plants and offices and stayed overnight and worked tirelessly to not only serve our customers, but to provide food and supplies to first responders and local shelters"
245,"As a company we’ve sent nearly 2,800 semis packed with food, water and other critical supplies to the region"
246,More than 350 individual associates from all corners of the country traveled to Houston to lend their hands to help uplift the community
247,Having a physical presence and truly being part of a community is always important
248,This is perhaps never more apparent than when natural disasters strike
249,You and our stores are a vital part of the communities we serve
250,What I’m most proud of is how you’ve taken care of each other
251,"Whether that’s giving a hug to someone who needs it or traveling across the country to work side by side in reopening our stores and warehouse, we take care of each other, it’s who we are"
252,"Each day we open our doors and welcome our neighbors with true hospitality and generosity, and together, we make the world a better place"
253,Thank you for all you do in big ways and small ways to feed the human spirit
254,We are truly Kroger Strong
255,That completes our call today
256,"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's third quarter conference call"
257,"On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer"
258,"We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany"
259,com
260,"Let me remind you that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit"
261,Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations
262,"Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website as well as in our filings with the SEC"
263,"In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release"
264,Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements
265,Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans
266,Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans
267,Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
268,"So with that, we'll now turn to our prepared remarks"
269,I'll cover our highlights of our third quarter business performance by segment
270,"Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and then finally, Benno will close with his perspective"
271,And then we'll open up the call for your questions
272,So let me start with our top line results
273,"In the third quarter, we reported 4% sales growth, which is really building on the results we've seen year-to-date"
274,"And, I think it's worth noting, this is in a consumer environment, where generally growth has been hard to achieve"
275,"Helping drive these results for Clorox are the investments we've made in our brands, including in innovation, and I'll be talking more about that in a moment"
276,So let me start with our Cleaning segment
277,"In our Cleaning segment, we saw third quarter volume increase 13% and sales grew 7%, and this was behind higher shipments of Home Care and Professional Products"
278,"And sales growth, while quite strong at 7%, did lag volume growth primarily due to unfavorable mix from incremental distribution in the club channel, as well as our higher investment in trade promotion in the quarter"
279,"In Home Care, which is our largest U.S"
280,"business unit, sales increased double digits and this gain was driven by very strong volume growth, particularly from disinfecting products with record third quarter shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes behind club channel distribution, as well as from our new Clorox Scentiva line of disinfecting wipes and sprays"
281,"These products provide an experiential fragrance while cleaning the home, and while still early, Clorox Scentiva is off to a strong start"
282,"If you look across all of Home Care, the gains in volume were really very broad-based across both channels and the entire portfolio"
283,"And this is really consistent with our results because, as we saw, the business unit delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of market share gains"
284,"Moving to the Professional Products business, it delivered strong sales growth in the quarter with continued strength in professional cleaning, driven by Clorox disinfecting wipes, Pine-Sol and Glad, aided in part by strength in B2B e-commerce channels"
285,"And in professional healthcare, the new product we discussed with you last quarter, Clorox Fuzion, continues to run well ahead of expectations"
286,"As a reminder, Fuzion is a new cleaner and disinfectant for healthcare institutions that kills microorganisms, but with minimal residue or odor which addresses a significant need in the healthcare business"
287,"Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased slightly largely due to continuing softness in our Clorox 2 color-safe laundry additive business"
288,"However, our strategy for the entire Laundry business remains unchanged as we continue to trade up consumers to more value-added offerings such as Clorox Splash-less Bleach, which is doing quite well, as well as leveraging the Clorox equity across both Laundry and Cleaning, which is reflected in the success we've seen in our Home Care business"
289,"Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 9% volume growth and 4% sales growth"
290,"Lower third quarter sales in Charcoal were more than offset by the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May, as well as from higher sales in Cat Litter"
291,"Starting with Charcoal, sales and volume were down in Q3, but this was following high single-digit growth in the year-ago quarter"
292,"So simply put, we were facing some pretty challenging comparisons versus a year ago"
293,"Looking at this year, the initial ramp-up for the summer barbecuing season was a bit slow, in part due to poor March weather, and it also skewed slightly away from our premium instant-lighting product, Match Light, resulting in an unfavorable mix impacting Q3. But, as a reminder, the bulk of our Charcoal business occurs in the fourth quarter, which is the current quarter that we're in now, and we're supporting the 2017 grilling season with our new premium Kingsford long-burning briquette that we started shipping in January"
294,"Turning to Cat Litter, sales increased strongly, supported by all-time record shipments of Scoop Away and strong shipments of Fresh Step, primarily due to increased merchandising support, the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation, and strength in the grocery channel"
295,"And while still early, our new Fresh Step Hawaiian Aloha item, which began shipping in January, is off to a strong start"
296,"And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise"
297,"Turning to Glad Bags and Wraps, sales came in flat for the quarter with volume down slightly, driven by a softness in our food protection business"
298,"However, our premium trash bag business, particularly behind OdorShield, continues to grow, consistent with our strategy to support retailers in trading up consumers to more value-added offerings"
299,"And then I'll wrap up the discussion of the Household segment with Renew Life, which contributed strongly to the segment's growth this quarter"
300,"You know, in short, we remain very excited about this acquisition"
301,"Again, we made this acquisition about a year ago, this month"
302,And we continue to be focused on distribution expansion strategy
303,"That remains on track, and we feel very optimistic about future distribution opportunities"
304,"Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume decreased 1%, and sales decreased 3%"
305,"And the slight decline in volume was primarily driven by lower shipments in Water Filtration and Natural Personal Care, reflecting comparisons to double-digit volume growth in both businesses in the year-ago quarter"
306,"So, starting with our Brita water-filtration business, despite the sales and volume decline due to tough comps, again, particularly on our faucet mount products, our Q3 shipments this year on our pour-through systems and filters increased behind our latest wave of innovation, and specifically that was on a couple of products launched in mid-February"
307,"At that point, we started shipping our new Brita Stream Filter As You Pour Pitcher, which makes filtering water ten times faster, as well as our premium Brita Longlast Filter, which lasts three times longer than legacy filters and reduces more contaminants, including removing 99% of lead"
308,"Looking at Burt's Bees, Q3 sales and volume declined in comparison again to double-digit volume gains in the year-ago quarter as we lapped the launch of Burt's Bees lipsticks"
309,"At the same time, our lip balm business continues to perform very well with record third quarter shipments"
310,"And looking ahead to fiscal year 2018, we have strong plans in place for innovation in several areas to keep growing this business"
311,"Turning to our Food business, sales decreased and volume was flat for the quarter as we made significant incremental investments in March that are anticipated to contribute meaningfully to fourth quarter volume growth in support of new products"
312,"And these include Simply Ranch, a preservative-free offering in our original ranch lineup, and two new flavors of ranch, chili lime and cucumber basil"
313,"We're also leveraging the strength of the Kingsford brand, our Charcoal brand, by launching a new line of barbecue sauces"
314,"And then finally looking at our International business, sales increased 3%, while volume declined 2%"
315,"The modest volume decline was mostly due to lower shipments in certain Latin America countries, notably Argentina, driven by macroeconomic conditions"
316,"Partially offsetting this were increased shipments in Canada, which benefited from the Renew Life acquisition"
317,"And broadly speaking, although macroeconomic conditions remain tough, we are encouraged by the progress in our International business as our go-in strategy to improve profitability is also providing for selective investments in key markets which will support future top line growth"
318,"For example, in recent quarters, we have launched laundry innovations in several international markets that are off to a good start, including in Asia and Latin America"
319,"So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook"
320,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone"
321,"Like Rodney said, we were glad to see the better results compared to the fourth quarter for identical food store sales and for the second quarter-to-date, our ID sales are positive"
322,Tonnage continued to be positive during the first quarter
323,"We continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products as well as areas where we are saving customers’ time, such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat meal solutions"
324,Visits per household were flat in the first quarter
325,"Basket size and price per unit were down, but those were offset by household growth"
326,Loyal households grew 3.2% compared to last years first quarter and our loyal households had positive ID sales growth in the first quarter
327,"In the first quarter, our gross margin was down, operating costs were up, and FIFO operating profit was down"
328,"While this is not representative of our typical expectations, it is important to keep in mind that we are making very deliberate and targeted investments in line with our Customer 1st Strategy"
329,As Rodney outlined earlier we’ve made conscious decisions to increase starting wages in certain markets to improve associate engagement and retention that will create a better experience for our customers
330,We continued to invest and grow our digital business
331,Our digital revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared to last year
332,"This includes revenue from ClickList, Harris Teeter’s ExpressLane and Vitacost"
333,com
334,"As we continued to invest in price, we also remind you, Kroger’s investment in price can be seen very clearly if you look at our gross margins in the early 2000s compare to today"
335,Kroger has invested more than $3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers over that time period
336,We have no intention of giving up the momentum we’ve gained on low prices
337,These investments enable us to connect with our customers in a deeper way and increase our market share over time
338,"We are pleased that Kroger’s market share, as traditionally calculated, was up in the first quarter"
339,"That said, we recognize there is no perfect metric for capturing market share"
340,We are doing a lot of work to better define or perhaps redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores
341,"We see food as a massive, $1.5 trillion market, and we have a substantial growth opportunity in that market"
342,I also want to stress that we are committed to lowering costs as a rate of sales
343,Many of the things we are doing to pull costs out of the business today set us up for savings in the future
344,We will only further intensify our process improvement efforts
345,Now for an update on retail fuel
346,"In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.171 compared to $0.143 in the same quarter last year"
347,The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year
348,Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.33 times compare to 2.12 during the same period last year
349,This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the repurchase of shares
350,"Over the last four quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.5 billion in common shares, pay $438 million in dividends, invest $3.4 billion in capital, and merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million"
351,The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy
352,We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment grade rating
353,"Return on invested capital for the first quarter, on a rolling four quarter basis, was 12.75%"
354,"On the labor relations front, we are currently negotiating agreements with UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Dallas and our Food 4 Less Warehouse Stores in Southern California"
355,"Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates"
356,"Kroger’s financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face"
357,"Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger’s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, and enhance job security, for our associates"
358,"Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We had previously indicated that the environment during the first half of this year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we’re seeing"
359,"As Rodney said, there is a lot of change in the retail food industry"
360,"That, coupled with the transition from deflation to inflation creates a challenging operating environment"
361,"The deflationary environment was less severe in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, coming in at 20 basis points deflationary without fuel"
362,Grocery was essentially flat during the quarter but had fluctuations up and down during it
363,Meat continued its deflationary trends
364,"And produce, while deflationary for the quarter, showed inflation in the last four weeks of the first quarter and pharmacy was inflationary"
365,As a result we increased our expectations for LIFO to $80 million; a $55 million increase over our initial expectations
366,We have also made some incremental investments in price in certain markets that had very hot features on milk and eggs
367,"While this affects gross margin in the short-term, it is less expensive than regaining a customer’s loyalty"
368,"These two, plus the incremental investments in hours and wages, are the primary factors causing us to lower our guidance for the year"
369,Our GAAP net earnings per diluted share guidance for 53 weeks is now $1.74 to $1.79. Our adjusted net earnings guidance range is $2 to $2.05. The previous adjusted net earnings guidance range was $2.21 to $2.25. See Form 8-K we filed this morning for additional information on guidance
370,"Because this is an unusual year, we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compared to our long-term guidance rate, as we’ve done in the past"
371,"For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the second quarter to be down compared to last year, the third quarter to be up slightly compared to last year, and the fourth quarter to be flat, excluding the 53rd week"
372,"We continue to expect identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of flat to 1% growth for 2017. And we continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Over the long term, we remain committed to achieving net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend"
373,"Now, I’ll turn it back to Rodney"
374,"No, I absolutely agree"
375,"And the whole trick here, John, is how quickly the lines cross on our price investments create more gross profit margin dollars"
376,"And as we said in the prepared remarks, there's really two things relative to the labor, one is adding some hours to certain service departments as well as increase in starting wages, which we believe over time will reduce our turnover, which has a great payback when we can have a higher retention of our associates who then are more productive and give a better shopping experience"
377,So that one has a little bit longer runway relative to when we see the benefits of those investments
378,"Yes, Rodney, $0.035, $0.04 in that range"
379,"John, it's not necessarily that it’s dramatically different today than we’re expecting, but when we look forward based on the movements we’re seeing in the lot of the underlying commodities"
380,"We do think there could be a little more inflation by the end of the year than we originally thought, but the accounting convention is whatever your year-end estimate is, you expense that ratably throughout the year"
381,"So it's really more reflective of where we think the end of the year is going to be not necessarily what happened in the first quarter, but we’re required to ratably expense that over the year"
382,We talked about all of those and deciding exactly where to set the guidance range
383,"We spend a lot of time taking where we are today, looking at the forecast for the rest of the year, trying to understand the gives and takes and settled on the $2 to $2.05. A wider range, perhaps we could have done that"
384,The only answer I had to that is we decided that we feel good about the range we put out there
385,We do feel good about the traction we are getting in ID sales that we think will help us support that ID guidance range
386,"Relative to the operating cost reductions, I think – I don't have any concern that we aren’t going to continue to get the operating cost reductions we're getting"
387,"We have made an independent decision to add some service hours to some departments as well as in some markets increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have, which hurts the customer experience as well as creates its own cost in friction when you are constantly hiring training people"
388,We didn’t do that across the country
389,"It's in select markets, but it's not an inexpensive proposition"
390,So we try to factor all of those in
391,"In fact, what we call enabler savings are actually pretty close to tracking to exactly what we expected in total to save on our cost savings initiatives for the year"
392,Thanks Karen
393,"It’s a great question Zach and it's – one of those it's always hard to answer, because you don't know what a customer would have done"
394,"The best we can tell, if you would give a range of between 40% to 60%, you’re probably within that range, but it is a hard, hard number to guesstimate, because you really don't know for sure – incremental or that you would have guided anyway either way"
395,"Again in response to Karen’s question, you never know when somebody in select markets is going to run some hot feature, and you have to make independent decisions as those features hit the street"
396,Is it somebody just run an ad for a couple of weeks trying to get some business in the store or they going to do something longer term
397,"And when those kinds of ad stay there for a little bit longer, particularly when it's two important commodities like milk and eggs, ultimately we're going to react and not allow our customers to think they have to go somewhere else to get the best value for those kinds of products"
398,Just so happens those two commodities are big commodities and its expensive when hot features hit versus some other commodities and to say we do or don’t have something exactly built into our business plan
399,"So that's difficult to say, but we did make the decision to react to those prices and to keep the customers inside of our stores"
400,"I think we all believe that the industry is going to continue to get more competitive because every year, it does get more competitive"
401,I think the price investments that we've made so far from our original pricing plan are taking good hold and good effect and we always still dollars in and to try to allow us to react to competitive pressures
402,"So I think the guidance where we've lowered it to certainly have some [indiscernible], everything that may happen"
403,"As Rodney said, it’s our best guess at this point in time"
404,[Indiscernible]
405,"Yes, well our brand has been incredibly important to Kroger since the founding of the Company"
406,"And the research that we did last year, we want to make sure that we weren't just biased because we're so close to it and we did the research with our customers and our customers gave us glowing feedback on how strong our brands were, how great the products were in a blind panel"
407,So they didn’t know it was us
408,"If you look at our Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic, we just crushed the competitors in that space"
409,"So for us, our brands has always been massively important and we will have a world-class our brand approach and it's important for our customers, it's important in terms of being able to make money as well"
410,"So we don't look at it in terms of trying to do something versus a CPG, we really look at it is our brand and building our brands and doing the things that customer wants"
411,"Yes, I would say that when we look at gross margins overall, there's a variety of factors that wind up going into that"
412,"I think you'll continue to see us over time, reduced gross margins"
413,"If you think about my prepared comments over the last 12 years or 14 years, we've invested $3.8 billion in price by the drop we've made in gross margin"
414,"And I think over time, you'll continue to see it go down, it’s typically what happens in that any segment of retailing to get laser focused on one particular year or one particular quarter"
415,"I probably wouldn't get that specific, but certainly when you look at it over time"
416,"We built our business model, assuming that gross margins will go down"
417,We need stronger IDs and we've had the last few quarters and we need to get back of the productivity loop of allowing our operating costs to come down as a rate of sales to grow that operating profit margin
418,"Obviously as I said in my prepared remarks, these are representative of the results we expect to deliver over time"
419,"But every once in a while you run through cycles, where you have to step back and adjust many of the metrics inside the company and we feel that we've done a good job of react and I'll sensibly and proactively to the environment around us, both from a labor standpoint, from a price investment standpoint and what makes sense to grow the business for the long-term"
420,"Well, as Rodney said in response to an earlier question, we typically don't lead our market down on price, accepting categories where it's one of our strategic investments we're making"
421,You typically won't see us anymore maybe in the 1990s we did this
422,"But you won't see the kind of reaction where we have very, very hot features that in the end don’t drive any kind of loyalty in your store and just tries to drive foot traffic and get them to buy other things"
423,"Will we react to those types of things and make investments, so that they don’t attracting of our customer stores, absolutely we will"
424,"But I think if you look over time, we’ll continue to be proactive on how we make the investments"
425,"Yes, a great question that I won't get into all the specifics because obviously competitors would appreciate that knowledge as well"
426,"What we're finding is the quality of that meal is the same as going to a restaurant and getting the meal, but people like to prepare something at home and they find it easy and they love the variety that we offer"
427,"So lot of the price comparisons is what the prices versus going to a restaurant, but being able to do it at home and when it takes to 20 minutes, it's just as fast as Kroger’s that is going to a restaurant and going through all that household when you're at a restaurant, and we're getting great feedback"
428,"We’ll continue to roll it out based on the ability for the facilities to handle the volume, and so far it's been very good and we appreciate and looking forward to work out"
429,"When you look at how people are going to promote and what will be features are going to be, I wouldn't have enough time to step back and think about how our merchants develop their marketing plan, they’re well out, the multiple weeks out"
430,"We certainly make assumptions about how customers or how other competitors reacting around holidays, how they may react in weeks, during the summer when there's a lot of vacations going on and maybe fewer people at home shopping and what kind of promotions they may do"
431,"But to be able to sit here and say, this is exactly what we're expecting from a promotional standpoint will be very difficult to say I have X, Y or Z built into the plan"
432,Other than we know there is always going to be markets and there always are markets where there are a lot of hot features going on
433,"There's other markets that are kind of in the middle, there is high low kind of activity kind of normal traditional grocery store pricing"
434,"And then there is other markets that are relatively benign where you go back to daily that fortunately for us, we have the number of markets we're in the breath of those markets that not every market is high for competitive at the same time in some of the ones that aren't quite as competitive help offset that"
435,"So to sit here and try to project what the competitive environment are more specifically, the promotional environment maybe would probably not be any significantly prudent"
436,I'm not sure exactly where to start on all those questions
437,"At the end of the day, we always assume this industry is going to get more competitive quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out and unfortunately I guess we're really disappointed with the result of our expectation and that's that – it's always been a competitive market"
438,It's always been a competitive industry
439,"In our view, it's going to continue to be competitive"
440,There are bursts of time where things heat up and then burst of times where cool down and we know over time that if somebody runs a high feature over the course of the weekend that's one thing
441,"If somebody appears to be try and to put a stake in the ground on big volume important commodities to drive volume into their stores, the best thing we can do to counteract that is as Rodney say, not lose on price of that commodity, because that takes the advantage away from them and it doesn't get any of our loyal customers or any of our customers, any reason to go anywhere else to shop"
442,"And you have to make judgments throughout the course of a year and a quarter of – is this a short-term thing somebody is doing that you can not necessarily this way, but by and large ignore or is this something you need to react to? How do you balance that with planned price promotions you have? Nobody on the call can see the advantage we create with our loyal household with the My Magazine, Rodney talked about or there were 6 million individualized offers in the first quarter alone, but offered those households a different price and everybody sees on their shelf edge"
443,We do that without creating any kind of price impression amongst our competitors because they don't know we're doing it
444,But that's the way to be able to reward and give a better price to our most loyal customers without putting it on the front page of an ad and perhaps us causing something like that to happen
445,So we're constantly using those kind of advantages we have primarily through 84.51° to figure out how to reward our most loyal customers the best
446,I wouldn't say we're thinking about M&A any differently at all
447,I do agree with Rodney’s assessment of consolidation
448,"I think you'll continue to see us have the opportunity to increase our footprint in markets we're already in by the consolidation of competitors we're going by the wayside, you saw the news reports from earlier in the week in Indiana"
449,And I think there will be a further opportunities like that going throughout the course of the next few years
450,It's one of the reasons why Rodney’s comment on reducing our capital expenditure on increasing our footprint
451,"It doesn't worry me too much over the next few years, because I think I can lower my CapEx invested in things are going to drive sales and reduce operating costs and increase my footprint and prices below what it would cost me to build from the ground up"
452,"And when they get into those kinds of situations, it sites you really want the fit rate rather than buying an entire chain and trying to do something with that"
453,So I feel really good about that part of what's going on around this
454,I wouldn't get through specific
455,"One of the bigger areas that just always particularly of late, we have a lot of projects going on in/and around shrink, some tests going on and a handful of markets trying to reduce the trends on shrink"
456,"It's early on in those handfuls of markets, but early signs are the customers doing seems to be encouraging and hopefully as we get to the end of the year and it starts to be – end of the year and then the next year something that becomes a little bit of a tailwind instead of the headwind"
457,Or just shrink not being exactly where we wanted in these projects being able to turn the trend on shrink
458,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone"
459,Fiscal year 2017 was another successful year for our company
460,"We build momentum in every quarter, pivoted our business through the channels and categories driving global prestige beauty, created exciting new products, reached new consumers, and strengthened our multiple engines of growth"
461,"When the year began, we said we expected our sales to accelerate as demands progressed and they did, building each quarter and culminating in an exceptional final quarter and full year"
462,"The fourth quarter results came largely from terrific strengths in China, travel retail and online, as well as from many of our brands including our latest acquisitions"
463,"In this new fiscal year, we expect our effective strategy to continue to drive our momentum leading to strong sales and profit growth"
464,"For the full year, we delivered sales growth of 7%, approximately 2 points ahead of global prestige beauty, enabling us to once again gain share"
465,"This is the eighth consecutive year we generated a strong performance and outperformed the industry, demonstrating the sustainability of our strategy despite inevitable external headwinds"
466,"This year was marked by greater economic and geopolitical volatility and terrorism, which curtailed demand in several countries"
467,"The trend of consumers shifting their shopping preferences by channel accelerated, which resulted in declining traffic in some U.S"
468,brick-and-mortar department stores
469,"At the same time, global competition intensified as new beauty brands and thousands of new products competed for a share of consumer wallets"
470,"Despite these challenges, we strengthened our growth engines and created formidable new ones, which was evident in higher sales across our major product categories"
471,"Through our seasonal and luxury brands, we have reinvigorated our fragrance category"
472,We also solidified our leadership in the fast-growing makeup category with the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA
473,These exciting brands anchor our portfolio with millennial consumers who often prefer to shop in specialty-multi retailers and online
474,Central to our success was pivoting our business to capture new consumers
475,"We did this by increasing our exposure to the fastest-growing prestige channels, strengthening our brand portfolio, investing in key geography and enhancing our digital and social media communications"
476,"Consumers have a growing emotional attachment for their beauty experience, strong loyalty to product performance, a desire for high-touch service and a preference for experiential channels"
477,These are the pillars of our Company’s success that we will continue to build on
478,"In fiscal 2017, we took decisive steps to gain a more significant presence globally in specialty-multi retailers and increased our penetration by 40%"
479,"We have historically been well-represented in specialty-multi internationally, and we reinforced our position with new and existing retailers"
480,"In Europe, some of our brands expanded in Sephora and Douglas"
481,"In Asia, our brands went into more Sephora stores in China and Southeast Asia and captured new opportunities with the brand-building specialty-multi retailers that are emerging"
482,Clinique was our first brand in Eveandboy in Thailand and in Olive Young in Korea
483,In the U.S
484,", our high-end La Mer and Jo Malone brands entered Sephora’s flagship stores and began selling on its website, joining many of other brands – of our brands that are already successful there"
485,"In addition, Estée Lauder and MAC opened in selected ULTA Beauty stores and on ulta"
486,"com, which helped them reach new target consumer, especially in smaller cities"
487,"E-commerce continued to be vibrant and our business accelerated, growing 33%, with strong global growth"
488,"Our brands opened sites in new countries and with various retailers, planting seeds for future gains"
489,"In the fourth quarter, we launched MAC on China popular Tmall, and it was the platform’s largest prestige beauty launch"
490,"Our travel retail sales grew more than 20%, generating the best gains in five years due to strong demand for our product and wider availability of our brand portfolio in large productive airports"
491,Passenger traffic grew high single-digits and a resurgence of Chinese tourists helped drive our strong performance
492,"We remain the leader in makeup and skin care combined in travel retail, and our makeup sales soared, which lifted many brands"
493,One of those was Tom Ford
494,"Its travel retail business more than doubled, fueled by Chinese consumer who coveted the brand’s high-end makeup and fragrances"
495,Our brands continue to be highly desirable
496,"Our best performers were many of our mid-size and luxury brands, which grew double-digits and helped fuel our makeup, skin care, and fragrance categories"
497,"As an example, La Mer’s success stemmed from driving trial with compelling innovation and repeat purchases with core products"
498,"The Estée Lauder brand returned to solid mid-single digit global growth for the year, delivering gains in both makeup and skin care"
499,It was well positioned to take advantage of the resurgence in China and travel retail and strengthen its Europe franchises with innovative new products
500,"Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, and the Pure Color Envy lipstick lines all grew double-digits"
501,The brand also benefited from effective social media and digital market which led to its top ranking in the L2 China Beauty Index
502,We strategically invested in key geographies to match success
503,"Countries represented more than one quarter of our sales grew double-digits, including emerging markets of China and Russia as well as developed countries like Italy"
504,We attribute the strong results to locally relevant products and communications and targeted expanded consumer reach
505,"Thanks to a strong economy and growing desire for prestige beauty, demand from Chinese consumer climbed, both in the local market as they travel the world"
506,"Our China business accelerated throughout the year, delivering outstanding growth of more than 40% in the fourth quarter and 90% for the year"
507,"A record 133 million Chinese tourists traveled last year, as we see this momentum continuing, which should positively impact our business across the globe"
508,Enhancing our social media and digital engagement is a priority across our portfolio
509,Our brands leveraged a growing number of influencers
510,"And as we grew our experience, we gain share in our media value, ending the year as the number one prestige beauty company in the U.S"
511,according to Tribe Dynamics
512,"The intersection of social media, digital marketing, and e-commerce is integral to our brand strategies and we have a digital first mind-set throughout the company at this point"
513,"In fiscal 2017, we continue to direct more advertising dollars to the digital space"
514,"Nearly half of our visible A&P spending globally was digital, up significantly from the year before"
515,"In other areas, we began implementing several programs under our Leading Beauty Forward initiative"
516,"We augmented our digit talent, capped expenses, and reinvested in high-growth areas to position us to compete more effectively in the environment that lies ahead"
517,"With the prestige beauty landscape shifting rapidly, we are proactively positioning ourselves to capture the new ways consumers are engaging with beauty"
518,"To continue to lead and win, we will leverage our company strengths; our broad prestige brand portfolio, superior product quality, creativity, talent, and brand building distribution all across our many geographies"
519,Let me now discuss the focus of our fiscal year 2018 strategy
520,"We will continue to connect our brands to high growth, brand-building channels to align with how and where consumers are shopping"
521,"We expect specialty-multi, online, travel retail, and freestanding store will continue their strong growth"
522,Dennis will discuss the online segment shortly
523,"In specialty-multi, we have captured a new consumer by matching our brands with global retailers that are the right fit in collaborating to drive trial, repeat purchase and regimen usage"
524,"For example, MAC is opening in Sephora’s top stores in Brazil and we launched in the specialty multi-channel in Asia-Pacific"
525,"We are rolling out Too Faced in Sephora in most European markets, including France and, in Douglas, in Germany"
526,In the U.S
527,", La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford will solidify their distribution in Sephora while Estée Lauder, MAC and Clinique will extend their presence in ULTA"
528,"In addition, Bumble and bumble is launching on ulta"
529,com this weekend followed by 500 ULTA stores
530,"In travel retail, we are building on our strength in skin care, further growing our makeup and fragrance categories"
531,"We are introducing some of our newer brands, opening more doors in high traffic airports, developing new store formats, ensuring we have locally relevant product in major travel corridors"
532,"We expect the higher passenger traffic coupled with effective marketing to increase conversion, will lead to strong sales growth again this year"
533,We are enhancing the experience of our freestanding stores by adding more open sell environments such as in MAC redesign of its Time Square flagship
534,"MAC will offer different shopping option across its stores, which should strengthen productivity"
535,"Throughout our more than 1,400 global freestanding stores, we are adding more omni-channel capabilities to connect them with online"
536,"Globally, department stores are an important brand-building channel that provide high-touch service, and we are investing by modernizing our counters in our service model in the best performing doors"
537,Many international department store continue to generate very healthy growth especially those in high traffic touristic destinations like Harrods or Selfridges in London where our business is robust
538,"In several other markets such as China or Italy, department stores are delivering strong gains"
539,Our biggest challenge has been in some U.S
540,"brick-and-mortar department stores, which are struggling from falling foot traffic especially in smaller malls and touristic driven doors"
541,department store represents approximately 17% of our global sales last year
542,And we are encouraged by new signs of strength in some retailers’ top doors
543,"We will leverage debt activity by improving our merchandising, our service, our communication, and our sampling and we are also collaborating with U.S"
544,"department stores to boost that business online, which is growing strongly"
545,We expect our makeup and fragrance categories to lead our growth
546,"As the global leader in prestige makeup, we are leveraging individual strengths of our many makeup brands to cater to different consumers"
547,We will drive our luxury and our seasonal fragrance portfolio by strengthening the brands we recently acquired and supporting and Jo Malone and Tom Ford excellent momentum
548,"In skin care, our sales improved last year and we anticipate even better growth this year supported by exciting innovation and more robust consumer demand"
549,"Looking at our three biggest brands, we expect Estée Lauder to, again, deliver solid growth"
550,"We also anticipate improvements at MAC, its international business has remained strong"
551,And it plans to open 200 new ULTA stores in the U.S
552,by fiscal year-end
553,Clinique has enjoyed good momentum in China and travel retail in recent months in recent response to new launches such as Fresh Pressed Serum with pure vitamin C and we believe its results will also improve
554,We will continue to reallocate resources and add talents to our social media programs which have become a critical component of beauty marketing
555,Our brands are aligning with authentic and locally relevant influencers and amplifying their storytelling to ensure that their content is differentiated and memorable
556,Consumers are purchasing beauty products more frequently than in the past partly because they can quickly and easily order online
557,"This is especially true for our hero products and franchises, which generate more triumph in bringing new consumer as well as repeat business, which is more profitable"
558,We have robust cadence of launches planned with an emphasis on strengthening core franchises
559,"As an example, Estée Lauder just introduced Advanced Night Repair eye concentrate matrix which incorporates innovative technology and has been well received"
560,"It also launched a new formula of its best-selling Double Wear foundation, which is a top recruiting product in many markets, attracting both millennials and ageless consumers"
561,Foundations are a large and high loyalty subcategory and many other brands like Clinique are introducing new formulas
562,It’s Even Better glow makeup is off to a strong start
563,MAC Next to Nothing lightweight foundation is a departure from the brand’s full coverage makeups and should continue to be a strong recruitment product this year
564,"In skin care, La Mer is rolling out two new types of moisturizer to support its iconic Crème de La Mer product lineup including a lotion with a matte finish and we expect a strong consumer response"
565,"Clinique launched Fresh Pressed serum and a supercharged version of Moisture Surge a few months ago, each to terrific perception and they should continue to be a major sales driver for the brand this year"
566,"To gain insight and help drive decisions across innovation, social media, and marketing, we are using much more analytics"
567,"We expect our investment in advertising to increase and comprise a greater percent of sales with digital media, the fastest growing outlet"
568,"We will advance more programs and the Leading Beauty Forward, allowing us to drive further efficiency, provide more fuel, reallocate resources to high growth area in advertising and better leverage sales growth"
569,"In closing, we are extremely proud of our performance in fiscal 2017. I want to thank our global employees and my executive team for their leadership and ability to effectively execute change across the organization, which is an important competitive advantage for our company"
570,We are fortunate to operate in a highly desirable industry they are focused on the many opportunities in our future
571,We are confident in our ability to win
572,"We will achieve our goals by leveraging our successful strategy that is based on multiple engine of growth, a well-diversified business, superior talent and creativity and unmatched product quality and branding"
573,"As we have shown this past year, we are executing our change agenda with excellence and speed"
574,"As we drive our momentum, we will continue to embrace a changing landscape, push the boundaries of possibility and pivot to tomorrow’s opportunity as consumer preferences evolve"
575,"As I mentioned, we are instilling a digital-first mind-set throughout our company"
576,And now Dennis McEniry who has led our online business for the past 17 years will discuss this exciting area
577,Dennis?
578,"And on the contour of the cadence, in fact, the activity also – the base of the second six months would be stronger than the base of the first six months"
579,"As you remember, we had the first quarter last year at plus 2%, 3%"
580,And so that’s the other factor that we would need to expect
581,"So in our estimate, we do expect a stronger top line in the first six months from the second six months"
582,"But we expect also very strong and solid second six months and as we said, a 7% to 8% for the year"
583,"On the second question, on your question on Amazon, I mean, we distribute into brand-building distribution, which exercise the key drivers of our prestige beauty including High-Touch services"
584,And so we are ready to distribute in channels where those criterias are fully respected
585,We do distribute in some global e-commerce platforms like Tmall where those criterias are respected
586,"At this point we do not distribute in Amazon, and in our fiscal year 2018 plan and estimates, there is no distribution in Amazon included"
587,"Yes, no, absolutely, no"
588,We are really strongly collaborating with our partners in department store to increase traffic
589,And I mentioned that – but I mentioned merchandising
590,"We are relooking at merchandising activity and we are relooking at our counters, at our system of engagements in store, and we are making some progress, in my opinion"
591,"But obviously most importantly is the way innovation gets executed, and the way social media gets executed on the innovation is also an important element to contribute to traffic building again"
592,"The third big factor, we are working very aggressively with our partners with online"
593,"And they’re making excellent progress online, and we are making on our business very good progress on e-commerce with them as well, and that’s also important"
594,"The other important thing that e-commerce is increasing the frequency of purchase of our consumers because their repurchase is readily available, and sometimes in the past, people would have waited to repurchase their regular preferred product to the next visit"
595,Now they don’t need to wait
596,So basically all the gaps of people in usage or repeated usage of product are being filled by the user online
597,"That’s also very true also in the department store channel, and we are leveraging this reality"
598,"We are seeing some initial progress in the strong doors, and as I said in my prepared remark, the problem remains in the smaller malls where traffic for the moment is not yet strong"
599,But I’m optimistic that we may see – we may have in front of us a moment of improvement in this area in fiscal year 2018.
600,"So on the first question, as I said, all of our brand – our company is 100% focused on prestige luxury beauty, meaning that all of our brands without exception are distributed in brand-building distribution proven to have all the driver of prestige"
601,So there will not be exception for brands like – any brand
602,"And Clinique, by the way, is very much a key prestige brand in our portfolio"
603,"On Asia, yes, 40% is a big number, so I’m not going to say 40% is sustainable"
604,But a double-digit continuous growth in this moment looks very sustainable because there are several dynamics that are playing in the China situation
605,"First of all, the growth in China is depending a lot from the lower import duty that’s been passed on to pricing into the local product"
606,This has pushed the market
607,Then the second big dynamic is that the Chinese consumers are passionate about makeup and fragrances more and more
608,So China historically was really driven by skincare
609,"Today, China is driven by three engines, two of which on a very dynamic growth"
610,"So this is proven by our retail growth in quarter four, where we had for example some brands like MAC that just doubled the business in one quarter now, obviously helped by the team who launched"
611,"But still, the growth in the same-door brick-and-mortar was outstanding, and the same for our Bobbi Brown and the same for our Estée Lauder makeup, where historically Estée Lauder was very successful on skincare only is now adding a very important leg in makeup"
612,"This phenomenon is going to continue, in our opinion, and that’s why it would be sustainable"
613,"Third point in China, we see growth from department store, from Sephora, from freestanding store, from online; it’s really across and it’s across all the cities"
614,We are in 170 cities
615,"When we look at our online sales, where the purchases come from, an enormous amount of these purchases come from cities we do not operate in brick-and-mortar, which makes the distribution in China efficient, but also the opportunity to grow new consumers come from cities where we do not operate today"
616,"And then finally, the portfolio fragrance is going to get traction for the industry and for us, particularly Jo Malone and Tom Ford at this point"
617,So I believe there is a lot of traction and a lot of fundamentals in China in this moment which is very strong
618,"Now, you asked about Korean brands"
619,"Yes, in this moment Korean brands in China are weaker than usual and this may not be the sustainable part of the story"
620,"But that’s why I wanted first to explain the sustainable part of the story because I believe that even when the Korea brands demand had to stabilize, I think we will continue to see good traction in China"
621,MAC U.S
622,"is improving, that has still been declining in the last quarter"
623,"So our expectation is that the brand will improve by better innovation, stronger social media, improvement in store and obviously activities, which are about the assortment and the marketing plans of the brand, which are in evolution to better match the consumer expectation and the consumer evolution"
624,"And also the distribution, MAC is still very much exposed in the U.S"
625,to the foot traffic of brick-and-mortar department stores
626,And so this will be for some time
627,And so we will – we are working to improve MAC trend in the U.S
628,as well
629,"But for the moment, we are assuming that MAC in the U.S"
630,will get the majority of the improvement from the marketing I said and from the ULTA distribution that I quoted in my prepared remarks
631,The rest of the benefit will come from the international business
632,"Most importantly, I want to underline that MAC online in the U.S"
633,", as was explained in the prepared remark of Dennis, grew 29% last year and we are expecting this to continue"
634,"So in summary, better marketing, better in-store activities, more social media, ULTA distributions, strong online are the positives that should create the improvements of MAC And we are for the moment not assuming an enormous improvement in the brick-and-mortar department store part in our estimates but we are working on it actively"
635,I’ll start with – to say your question is if the consumer will get accustomed to promotion
636,"I mean, they are – consumers are segmented, and there are certain consumers that do wait for promotional opportunities to buy and this is not new"
637,This has always been the case
638,And there are other consumers that don’t
639,"But on average, I just want to make you think that the growing part of the business is the non-promoted one"
640,And the growing – the fastest-growing channels are the channels that promote the least
641,"And so in total, I would say that prestige beauty is from a consumer standpoint is an industry that need a moderate amount of promotions"
642,And then where there are excessive promotions is a short-term event that generally doesn’t generate a change in consumer behaviors
643,And then I think Tracey will address Leading Beauty Forward
644,So I’m not sure I understand completely the question
645,"But no, we don’t see any change in the dynamic of the industry"
646,"Actually, let me take the opportunity to explain one important thing"
647,"Obviously, the industry is based on trial and repurchase"
648,What the change of the last few years is that the trial activity has become more competitive
649,"There are more brands that have been in some cases promotions, they’ve been more active"
650,"And so, the world of trial has become more competitive"
651,But the world of trial tends to be an investment
652,"The world of repurchase, loyalty, actually has not changed a lot"
653,"The loyalty level on our brands are improving in some cases, stable in others"
654,The repurchase rate remains very high for our hero SKUs
655,"So, what’s happening is that the repurchase is still driven by product quality and by product performance and by brand loyalty"
656,And those things are not changing much less
657,"Now, it happened that the majority of the profitability is in the repurchase gain"
658,"And so, the brands and the companies that own the repurchase gain are owning more of the profit and more of the cash"
659,"And the trial gain which is becoming more competitive is what we are all reacting to, improving our social media activation, our innovation, our activation in-store and all the rest"
660,"Promotion is only one element of how this is evolving and, frankly, not the biggest one in my opinion"
661,"So, on stats and then Tracey, you take SMI"
662,"So, on Clinique"
663,Clinique is growing in Asia
664,Clinique is growing in Europe
665,Clinique is growing in Latin America
666,I’ll ask Dennis in a second to speak about Clinique online
667,Fresh Pressed has been a success
668,There are several aspect in the Clinique business which is growing
669,Clinique in brick-and-mortar U.S
670,department store is declining
671,"And since this is still an important part of Clinique business, obviously, this is offsetting some of the positive moments"
672,"Sorry, then you asked about specialty, Clinique is growing in specialty in the U.S"
673,"Dennis, on online?"
674,Yes
675,"And then on MAC again, as I said before, I already answered the question on what type of positive signs from MAC which is, MAC international and MAC online, ULTA, MAC in the U.S"
676,", the improvements in MAC marketing activity, et cetera"
677,"But yes, the two areas of MAC which are still taking the brand down are brick-and-mortar brand store and freestanding store U.S"
678,But freestanding store outside of the U.S
679,keep growing profitably
680,"So, those are the two areas where we are working to further turn around the MAC However, to be clear, the expectation in fiscal year 2018 is MAC to grow because between the positive and these two areas still to be fixed, the positive are much bigger than these two areas still to be fixed"
681,"Yes, I would like to take the opportunity of this question to make one thing noticeable, that we have double-digit growth in many of these channels"
682,"But if you just take the combination of travel retail, specialty-multi, online, you arrive, just with these three, at well about one-third of the company"
683,"And this is growing very strongly and very double-digit, more than 20% each one of these channels, et cetera"
684,"So, we are in a situation from a channel diversification that we have more than one-third of the company growing in the high-20s and that’s very, very strong"
685,"So, the channel mix is actually a great point of our strategy of multiple engines of growth and diversification and is one of the key element which is building momentum"
686,"So, yes, in our plans, there is a stabilization of the U.S"
687,business without BECCA and Too Faced and absolutely
688,That’s what we are aiming for and working for
689,"And the second question, we believe that we can open more distribution points than what will be closed"
690,"And so, this will be – is in our numbers"
691,There’s still a net improvement of consumer reach in our plans
692,"So, freestanding – go, go"
693,"In terms of innovation, we have one of the strongest innovation pipelines"
694,"As I said in my prepared remarks, the innovation in fiscal 2018 will be also very focused on reinforcing the existing very strong franchises which are in all brands – Too Faced, Peach or Better Than Sex, Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, Clinique taking the Fresh Pressed concept to the next level, et cetera, et cetera"
695,"So, there is a lot of buildup"
696,"You are now going to see one blockbuster which is a high-return, high-risk"
697,"You’re going to see every brand to have three, five, big serious initiative well-focused by category"
698,"And the portfolio of innovation of the company to cover all the opportunity by sub-category and region in a much more sophisticated way than we did in the past, thanks to better analytic and better preplanning"
699,"Frankly, this is very small"
700,"I mean, only one small fragrance brand is really in these impairment"
701,And then one very small brand that was part of the acquisition before
702,"And most of the other brands are growing double-digit, triple-digit, out of our [indiscernible] where we’re including the small brands where we have an impairment on"
703,They are all growing double-digit or triple-digit
704,"And in the case of the impairment, it actually is a timing issue"
705,"So, frankly, no"
706,We believe our acquisitions have been very successful and there is only one brand that has a small delay which in the context of the many acquisition that we have done is frankly not relevant
707,"We are very satisfied with acquisition and we believe that BECCA and Too Faced and the other acquisition we have done particularly in the fragrances, or GLAMGLOW for example, are extremely successful and will continue to be a big part of our growth"
708,"Thank you, Chris, and Happy New Year to everyone"
709,"As I hope you saw in our press release, we had solid Q4 results overall with solid sales and business investments to further improve the health of our brand"
710,But I'll start by focusing more on what we have been able to accomplish in the first full year of The Kraft Heinz Company
711,It formed the base and in many ways that's our agenda for the year ahead
712,"So, let's start with our progress against the three objectives of our strategy that we laid out at the beginning of our merger"
713,"In our first objective, to deliver profitable sales growth, on the top line, we built positive momentum through the year, despite the commodity headwinds that persisted during the year, resulting in profitable sales and flat to positive organic sales growth in all regions except Europe"
714,We generated significant gains from our Big Bet innovation strategy in our efforts to capture whitespace opportunities
715,"This was led by condiments worldwide, especially ketchup and barbecue sauce, pasta sauce in North America and Latin America; soy sauce in China, and hot sauces and mayo in Europe"
716,"Our investments also led to better market share trends over the course of the year in core categories such as sauces worldwide including pasta sauce in Canada and Latin America; green cheese and mac & cheese in the United States, UK beans; baby food in Italy; and in Australia, beverage"
717,"That said we still have significant areas to improve in 2017. They include Indonesia soy sauces, U.S"
718,"cold cuts, baby food in Canada, and our non-measured channel shares in the UK to just name a few"
719,"We also pushed into places, whitespace, where Kraft Heinz did not previously compete, products such as Devour frozen meal, Cracker Barrel mac & cheese and Heinz Barbecue Sauces in the United States"
720,There was Planters which now is available in both China and the UK
721,"We also brought Heinz Mayonnaise to Europe, Brazil and Australia"
722,"And we made significant progress toward extending our foodservice presence, not just in the west but through strong performance in Canada, Brazil and Russia as well"
723,"Nevertheless, there is much, much more to go after in 2017 and beyond"
724,It's also clear that our go-to-market investments are paying off and delivering profitable growth through distribution gains and better performance at retail
725,"We supported go-to-market activations with better management of our field teams in Canada, U.S"
726,", Brazil, Russia and China"
727,"These efforts resulted in phased execution improvement in a challenging retail environment all around the world, including Australia, Japan, China, Russia, Egypt, Brazil and Germany"
728,"And then our second objective, we made meaningful progress toward achieving best-in-class margins"
729,"Through our ritual and routines, including zero-base budgeting and managed by objectives, we drove sustainable improvements throughout the year"
730,ZBB savings were a key driver of value creation across the company delivering faster than expected savings at the outset of the year and contributing to the company achieving $1.2 billion in cumulative savings since the inception of our Integration Program
731,"As of today, we have cascaded personal MBOs directly from company leadership to more than 6,000 employees worldwide"
732,This is a critical step in aligning everyone behind common goals and improving our day-to-day execution
733,"To put that number in context, this represents more than 50% of our white collar population around the world"
734,"And in supply chain, we invested more than $1 billon into manufacturing upgrades in our footprint program to modernize our facilities and enhance our capacity for innovation and quality"
735,"We went live with our Global Business Services in Europe, which together with our shared service integration in North America, helped drive processes standardization and improved service levels"
736,"Importantly, as all of these was happening, we achieved a global case fill rate of 98%"
737,"We also invested heavily in our people, in our capability"
738,"For example, we promoted more than 1,700 team members worldwide last year"
739,"We expanded our talent acquisition programs worldwide, growing the volume of applicants by 40%"
740,"And in our ongoing effort to grow a better world into a partnership with Rise Against Hunger, we package and distribute more than 65 million meals to people in need"
741,"Finally, on the capital structure front, our leverage ratio was reduced to approximately 3.6 times EBITDA and we kept up our strong dividend payout"
742,Paulo will build more on our capital structures improvement in a moment
743,"Overall, we made solid progress in our first full year as a merger company and it set a strong base for us to build upon in the next phase of our development"
744,So let's turn to slide three to review our Q4 and full year financial results and how the numbers bear out our progress
745,"As it relates to the company sales, there're really two things to highlight"
746,"First, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, we drove sequentially better organic sales growth driven by volume/mix improvement in all segments"
747,The primary contribution to this growth were condiments and sauce globally and costs in refrigerated meal combinations in the United States
748,"Second, we had solid price realization in most segments during the year despite a deflation in key commodities like dairy, coffee and meat in the U.S"
749,as well as the trade investments we made in our UK and Netherlands business
750,"Net EBITDA full year growth at constant currency was driven by strong cost savings from integration and restructuring activities, favorable net price and growth in our Rest of the World market"
751,I should note however that our rate of growth in Q4 was held back by two factors
752,"First, we began to lap integration savings that began last year in Q4. And, second, we accelerate our investment behind growth initiatives late in the year, as well as trade investment we made in our UK and Benelux business"
753,"Dropping down to our adjusted EPS, both Q4 and full year were up more than 50% excluding the extra week last year, primarily driven by EBITDA gains and the refinancing of the preferred stock in June"
754,"Now, I will hand over to George and Paulo to highlight our performance in each reporting segment and what we expect going forward"
755,George?
756,"Thank you, Paulo"
757,Let me start by saying that 2016 was a solid year for our company
758,We made a great deal of progress in realizing our potential
759,"But we still have a lot to improve in order to deliver our expectation for 2017. In 2017, we enter year two of our multi-year merger plan"
760,"Headwinds remain from highly competitive retail markets to persistent foreign exchange headwind, especially in Europe"
761,So at the top of our agenda is an even sharper focus on profitable organic sales growth
762,"By that, I mean that we will focus our investments in innovation, renovation and marketing on our leading brands, along with prioritizing fewer, bigger and bolder bets within our portfolio"
763,"These will include expanding our core by innovating into adjacent categories and new segments, where Kraft Heinz brand have the ability to win"
764,"It also includes Big Bets in existing categories by aggressively targeting on-trend segment where you're currently under indexed, such as the 2016 bet we laid in the U.S"
765,natural cheese
766,"For competitive reasons, we do not have a list of key initiatives to provide today, but we will certainly highlight them as we roll them out in the coming quarters"
767,"And finally, globally, we're focusing on three key brands: Heinz, Kraft and Planters, and in five categories with global potential; condiments and sauces, cheese, meals, nuts and baby food"
768,"The emphasis within these opportunities will be to increase investment levels and improve execution, which includes applying best practice for wining in each channel, from traditional retail and discounters to foodservice, and over time e-commerce"
769,"All this will be fueled by significant incremental investment in marketing, both for market capabilities and product development, covering North America, Europe and rest of the world"
770,Our agenda also includes achieving best-in-class operating efficiency with top quality
771,"We plan to reduce complexity through active assortment management in United States, an achieve best in class operations efficiency and quality within our manufacturing facility"
772,Also great execution begins with great training and we are actively building a new methodology and training platform to support our performance-driven organization
773,But let met turn it back to Paulo to wrap-up by explaining how our agenda will translate into 2017 financial performance
774,"Hi, Andrew"
775,"Hi, Bryan"
776,"Good afternoon, this is Bernardo"
777,"Look, about the repatriation, you're right, there would be the brands coming back to us in January 2018, and there is some work to be done in preparation"
778,"But from a cost standpoint or from a revenue standpoint, there is really no benefit or impact in the year, right"
779,"There is preparation from marketing, from distribution, from our manufacturing capabilities to hit the ground and be running, but I don't think there will be an impact to – on the cost or the revenue for the repatriation efforts"
780,"Hi, Rob"
781,"I think, it was important to highlight that, just to give a sense of the direction of the focusing looking at three global brands and five top categories that really, when you mix all them represent 70% of the business, and you're going to move forward"
782,"That is United States and North America like I mentioned, but also worldwide"
783,And so I don't think there is a distinction really in the amount of investment between U.S
784,and international
785,They will be – they'll be moving together
786,"They'll pursue different states and different – what the business is by country and by region, but as a focus looking mid-term, those are the ones"
787,"I think, it's important in your question also to highlight that our business is a balance between global brands and local brands"
788,Global brands having the strength and the scale to grow multi-categories and multi-regions; and the local jewelry (39:49) like we like to call customizing to consumer needs on local markets and regions
789,"So we are really happy with our portfolio and the balance we have today between the global brands and local brands, and the specific categories"
790,"But those three global, we're calling global brands, in those five categories is really what's going to push us to the next level that we're calling this balance towards profitable growth"
791,I don't think there is a distinction between investment in North America or internationally
792,It would be case-by-case depending on the state of the business at the regional level
793,"Hi, Michael"
794,"Look, we always look with this, the way that we think the categories and the brand, we always look and think about profitable and organic growth"
795,So the way you're directing here is all organic
796,And the reason for that is actually you're right to say it's true
797,"A small part in the total portfolio, but very relevant in many countries important for us, including Canada, including Australia, including the UK, for sure Italy like you mentioned, for sure China, Mexico, you're getting to Brazil, Russia that's the biggest category we have there"
798,"So when you see all this, even the small presence, where we have a presence it's significant through the Heinz brand most part of the time, sometimes local brands like Plasmon in Italy and so on"
799,"And we believe there is a lot of opportunities, like you said, in whitespace geography, again, country-by-country, region-by-region"
800,There is a role that can be played and we want to look at that with the right expectation
801,Good evening
802,"Hi, Alexia, it's Bernardo"
803,"Like we mentioned in the last call and continue to be, the point, our goal in Europe is to return to profitable growth"
804,"We really think that our performance – that was a weak performance in 2016 and Europe has absolutely no correlation with the cost side and like you mentioned the overhead, I think, there was a lot of correlation on the stakes, on the go-to-market and things on the promo side, volume mix that didn't work out as we showed, and what we are actually encouraged about is when you see the Q4, the performance by all the business, especially the Benelux and the UK had improved significant looking at sell out consumption, looking at share on the main category, soup, beans, sauces, and you already have 70% of renovation for the year ready in the market"
805,"So the results from the Q4 plus what you're seeing now in January moving into February, I really encouraged by a much better performance 2017 in Europe than you had 2016. Still going to be challenged, the retail environment is challenged like the density (54:59) between FX rate and everything that's happening in the continent"
806,"But that being said, I think the performance Q4 is really encouraging about we can have a better performance looking at 2017, than our weak performance in 2016."
807,"Look again, when we talk about profitable growth and like Paulo mentioned in the beginning, our idea of sales mix, really sales flowing to the bottom line"
808,We have no intention of gaining sales without profitability
809,Component that come attached to that
810,There are investments that needs to be done in the marketing side and in go-to-market side that I think we have been doing and we'll continue to do it
811,"But that being said, if we're able to create profitable growth sales in Europe that should come also with a better performance in the bottom line"
812,"Thanks, Don"
813,"Good morning, everyone"
814,I appreciate the opportunity to give you a deeper dive into our North American Retail segment
815,I’m proud to lead this team
816,We have great people
817,We’re moving with urgency
818,We’re operating differently than a year ago and I think you can begin to see that translate into our performance
819,The key messages for North America Retail this quarter are similar to headlines for a total company
820,We’re driving broad-based top line improvement with organic sales slightly positive amounting to flat in the quarter
821,"Our profit was down this quarter, but improved sequentially over the first quarter and we have clear initiatives that will deliver profit growth in the second-half"
822,We’re executing well against our fiscal 2018 priorities and we have strong back-half plans in place to maintain our trajectory
823,"Looking at the financial results in the second quarter, organic net sales for this segment were up just under 0.5%"
824,"Cereal posted 7% net sales growth, which was ahead of Nielsen-measured retail sales, due to non-measured channel growth, strong sell-in for new Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios and other quarterly timing shifts"
825,"Fiscal year-to-date, U.S"
826,Cereal net sales and retail sales are each roughly flat to last year
827,"Snacks net sales increased 5% in the quarter, with growth on Lärabar, Nature Valley and fruit snacks, partially offset by declines in Fiber One"
828,Canada net sales are up 1% in constant currency and net sales for the U.S
829,Meals & Baking operating units were down 2%
830,"yogurt net sales declined 11% and a 11 point improvement over the first quarter, driven by continued declines in Light and Greek varieties, partially offset by excellent innovation in news and core established brands"
831,"Segment operating profit declined 5% in constant currency in the quarter, driven by higher input costs, unfavorable trade phasing and increased advertising and media expense, partially offset by favorable product mix and benefits from cost savings"
832,We’ve driven sequential improvement in U.S
833,retail sales since the beginning of the year
834,"In fact, our second quarter retail sales trends are almost 700 basis points better than fourth quarter of last year and our improvement is driving better results for our categories"
835,We saw retail sales trend positive in measured channels in the second quarter
836,"And it’s not just a couple of businesses driving this trend, our retail sales trends are better in eight of our nine largest U.S"
837,We’ve had absolute retail sales and dollar shared growth in this quarter on six of these nine businesses
838,"Not only those – not only are these trends broad-based or high-quality, we’ve increased our brand-building investment this year and we’re leveraging new campaigns on some of our biggest brands, generated by new creative agencies and we’re taking a fresh approach towards consumer messaging"
839,"For example, new campaigns on Cereals, Nature Valley and Pillsbury are helping drive baseline sales improvements by as much as double digits for these branches at the end of last year"
840,"We’re also seeing benefits from an increased focus on innovation with retail sales from new products of more than 50% of the share, driven by successes like Oui by Yoplait and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios"
841,"In total, our second quarter baseline sales trends in the U.S"
842,improved by over 600 basis points relative to the fourth quarter of 2017. That represents more than 75% of our overall improvement in the Nielsen-measured channels
843,We’re also driving better merchandising performance this year
844,"Our display support, which is the most effective merchandise vehicle was up double digits in the quarter"
845,"And when you have good brand-building support and strong innovation, your merchandising works even harder for you"
846,It’s important to note that we’re maintaining discipline in our pricing in the market
847,Average unit prices for our overall U.S
848,portfolio were up 5% in the first-half
849,"However, three quarters of that increase was due to significant mix impacts from our year-over-year business"
850,"Excluding year-over-year, average unit prices for the rest of our portfolio were up 2% in the first quarter and about a 0.5% in the second quarter"
851,"The quarterly change was driven in part by moving end of the zone or [ph] dough businesses, where our seasonal pricing is lower than last year, but still higher than two years ago, as we had planned"
852,"As we look ahead to the second-half of fiscal 2018, remember that our Nielsen pricing metrics will compare against periods last year, when our aggregate U.S"
853,pricing was up 5% or more
854,"We’re also driving strong results in growing channels, including exceptional performance in e-commerce"
855,e-commerce business grew 82% in the first-half of the year and we still enjoy higher market shares in online full basket purchases compared to shares in bricks and mortar channels
856,We’re excited about the opportunity that e-commerce provides and we will continue to develop our insights and capabilities to keep our business in advantage position and it’s important in emerging channel
857,"With that as a backdrop, I thought I’d briefly check in on the segment priorities I shared at our Investor Day in July and give you a preview of the product news innovation that will drive results in the back-half of 2018. Our top priority, North America retailers are driving improved performance in U.S"
858,I’m happy to report that we’re achieving that goal through six months
859,"We’ve seen a strong turnaround performance in measured channels this year, with retail sales growth in the second quarter, and we’ve gained 70 basis points in market share through the first-half"
860,"Four of our largest taste-oriented cereals, which make up over third of our portfolio driving a performance this year"
861,"Year-to-date retail sales are Lucky Charms and Cocoa Puffs reached up 14%, while Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Reese’s Puffs are up 8%, the corn puff and kid cereals, because roughly half of the consumption on these brands is by adults"
862,"Compelling consumer news has been a theme across these brands, whether that’s new marshmallow news each quarter on Lucky Charms or cinnamon news on Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which has driven 43 consecutive months of market share gains for the brands"
863,We’re planning to extend our cereal momentum in the second-half behind some exciting innovation and platform marketing executions
864,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, which launched in October is off to a great start and is turning at the top of the category"
865,We’ll continue to fuel this new product in the second-half with strong in third quarter
866,"In January, we launched two new blasted shred cereals in Peanut Butter Chocolate and Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavors and an opportunity to invigorate $400 million shredded wheat segment by delivering on to tidy and taste"
867,What happened in the fast-growing nut butter channel with new almond butter and peanut butter varieties of our Nature Valley Granola Cereals
868,"We’re supporting these launches, as well as the rest of the portfolio with remarkable marketing and merchandising"
869,I’m probably most excited about our cheerios and merchandising initiatives at the Ellen DeGeneres show that begins in January
870,"We’re running an on packed sweepstakes, where consumers share an active good that demonstrated for a chance to win two prizes"
871,One for themselves and one to share with another person as an active good
872,The sweepstakes will be announced on the show next month
873,"Now let’s shift gears to our second priority, which is reshaping our U.S"
874,yogurt portfolio by innovating in faster-growing emerging segments of the category
875,"In 2018, the yogurt innovation has been tremendously successful thus far, led by Oui by Yoplait, which already makes up almost 10% of our U.S"
876,yogurt portfolio
877,"Oui’s glass jar and unique positioning really standout on shelf, which has helped drive strong consumer trial and we’re seeing an acceleration in repeat purchases"
878,"Retailers love wheat, because it is driving more sales with current consumers and attracting new yogurt buyers"
879,"Through the first four months in shelf, we used the largest launch in the category over the past five years"
880,And Yoplait Mix-Ins targets towards traditional yogurt levers looking for great tasting snack options is the second largest launch in the category this year
881,While innovation is critical to our U.S
882,"yogurt strategy, it’s also critical that we stabilize our two large core platforms in kid yogurts and Original Style Yoplait"
883,"This year, we adjusted our biggest consumer paying atGoGurt franchise by making the tubes easier to open"
884,"Consumer investment communicating this change is driving improvement on the GoGurt business, with retail sales nearly flat in the second quarter"
885,"We’re also investing in advertising for Original Style Yoplait, featuring our Mom On Campaign, where we celebrate hard working moms and show how Yoplait fits into our busy life, and we’ve seen sales trends improved here as well over the last few quarters"
886,"We have plenty of news to drive further improvement on GoGurt in second-half, and we were launching four additional flavors in January; Raspberry, Key Lime, Mango and Black Berry"
887,We’re also launching a new line of Annie’s powder sugars
888,We make this product using organic home milk and four flavors that combine fruits and vegetables with no added sugar
889,"Fruit is the hero on the traditional yogurt segment, nearly 50% of shoppers like more"
890,"So we’re giving them what they want, adding more fruits to our Original Style Yoplait"
891,"We’re updating the package to communicate the change, and thus using the change on TV and digital advertising"
892,We’ve also seen indulgence opportunity in the traditional yogurt segment and then we can bring more consumers to shelf for the decadent home milk and real food offering
893,Our new fruit sideline shows off its indulging ingredients with clear packaging and it’s price for the dollar to maintain broad appeal
894,We know there’s still a long way to go on the U.S
895,"sugar, but we like the direction we’re heading"
896,We think the combinations were first-half improvements and our back-half news will help us cut our declines to single digits by the end of the year
897,"Our third priority in North America Retail this year is driving differential growth on Totino’s hot snacks, Old El Paso and snack bars"
898,"I would say, we’re generating good growth so far this year with low single-digit retail sales increases across each of these large platforms"
899,"On Totino’s hot snacks, we were forced to led consumer support plan for the back-half, target towards a millennial male consumer"
900,We’re bringing to life for live free couch hard campaigns in time for football championship season by inviting consumers to show us how they couch hard
901,We’re supporting the campaign with football theme in store merchandising and we will continue to run advertising and digital in TV throughout the year
902,"For Old El Paso in the second-half, we’re accelerating our in-store activations"
903,"We’re again partnering with Avocados from Mexico, which is one of our largest merchandising events of the year, and we’re bringing taco truck merchandising displays to key retailers"
904,And we will continue to support the business with our Anything Goes in Old El Paso campaign
905,"Growth on our snack bars business has really been a tale of two stories, with strong growth from Nature Valley and Lärabar, offsetting declines in Fiber One"
906,"Retail sales for Nature Valley are up up double-digit so far this year, helped by new advertising on our core and excellent performance in our new nut better biscuits and granola cup platforms"
907,"And Lärabar continues to deliver 30% retail sales growth behind strong distribution growth and investment behind its food made from food campaign, which will continue in the back-half of the year"
908,The story on Fiber One is more challenging
909,We’re working hard to improve performance by refocusing our messaging on our core consumer and renovating our products and packaging which are the Fiber One’s core role permissible indulgence
910,"And the retail sales were still down sharply in the first-half, driven by reduced distribution base sales per point of distribution of turn positive, which is a good indicator of future trends"
911,"We’re working to rebuild the innovation pipeline of Fiber One, including the launch of eight new items in January, featuring four flavors of Fiber One Bites and we’re supporting these launches with our all mine TV and digital advertising"
912,We have some great new indulgent offerings on Nature Valley as well
913,Consumers are looking for indulgent treats made from real food
914,"So we’re introducing layer bars to have a triple layer of nut butter, granola with nuts and chocolate, and we’re launching soft-baked filled squares that combine whole grain Oatmeal bars with creamy peanut butter filling"
915,"We’ll support these lunches with TV, social media, digital coupons and merchandising"
916,"With the winter in full swing here in Minneapolis, I thought I’d share a quick update on our performance so far in the key soup and baking seasons"
917,We’re back in our game on – in soup this year
918,Retail sales growth were up 2%
919,"We gained a half point to share in the category two months in the soup season, with strength across a core registered business, including new progress organic"
920,"Retail sales for Betty Crocker Dessert Mixes were up a 0.5% since October, and we gained over a plenty of share behind strong and season support and good performance from our core segments"
921,"And I’ll closer by refrigerated dough, our results have improved over last year’s key season, but we’re still not where we want to be"
922,Our new media campaign Made at Home is driving better baseline sales and we have stronger merchandising plan this year
923,"Retail sales declined 1% in the first two months of key season, but we’re seeing month-by-month improvement and we posted growth in November"
924,"Our final priority for this year is to expand our national organic portfolio and we’re seeing good results here too, particularly on three of our largest businesses Mac And Cheese, Cereal and fruit snacks"
925,"We generate year-to-date market share gains across each of these categories due to strong consumer engagement, distribution expansion and instruct support, and we’ll continue those efforts throughout the second-half to continue to drive growth in our national organic portfolio"
926,I’ll close by summarizing my key messages for North America Retail today
927,"We’re seeing broad-based high-quality improvement in our top line trends, including organic sales growth in the second quarter"
928,Our profit performance is improving and we have clear initiatives that will deliver profit growth in the second-half
929,"We’re making progress on our fiscal 2018 key priorities, and we have strong back-half plans in place to maintain our trajectory"
930,"For the full-year, we now expect organic sales to be down 1% to 2%, which is a 100 basis points better than our original guidance"
931,We expect segment operating profit growth on a constant currency basis
932,"With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I hand it back over to Jeff"
933,"Good morning, Chris"
934,"Yes, sure"
935,"Thanks, John"
936,I’ll give you – try to answer as many of those questions I can as a lot rolled up there
937,"Clearly, it’s a competitive environment right now as new players entered the U.S"
938,as emerging channels like e-commerce come on to the scene
939,"So definitely, it’s competitive both on the retailer side, as well as the manufacturer side"
940,"What I can tell you is, I feel really good about our ability to compete in this environment"
941,Where we’re big in the U.S
942,", we’re one of the top food companies"
943,"We have scale across center store, refrigerated and frozen"
944,"And as we grow the categories of our retailers growth, so again, it’s important that we have good plans locked in with our retailers"
945,"In addition to that, we’ve got one of the best sales forces as ranked by Cantor in the industry"
946,They’re doing a great job of really sitting down with the retailers and putting together joint business plans
947,And what we find with those joint business plans is trade-offs
948,"And again, even across a retailer, we might give a bit one category to get something in return in another"
949,"But by applying our scale, and again, if we’re growing broadly, that’s really good for our retailers category"
950,We’re finding a way to get to win-win solution
951,"So, again, there’s a lot going on"
952,"And certainly, space optimization, that’s something that we’re seeing as well"
953,"What I’d tell you there is, we have some businesses that are going to win in that"
954,"So we have a broad snacking portfolio, which will likely win in that environment in addition to that natural organic’s core strength of ours as well with the third largest national organic player in the country, so that’s good"
955,And in the categories that might contract
956,"What we tend to see is that, the smaller manufacturers the third or fourth or fifth players tend to be the ones that lose"
957,And when you look at our business in the U.S
958,", 80% of our brands are the number one or number two in their category"
959,So it’s tough out there for sure
960,"But at the same time, I actually feel like, we’re in a place now that we can be advantaged and really win in this marketplace"
961,Thank you
962,Yes
963,"Sure, Matthew, this is Jon"
964,"What I can tell you is that, we really like the way that we’re competing in the cereal category right now"
965,"When you look at our performance through the first-half, our change in trend is pretty significant and nearly 70% of that change is from baseline sales"
966,"So, again, it’s really better innovation and better marketing that’s driving our results in the category, and that’s really been the recipe for success in the category over the long-term"
967,"So we’re very committed to, again, continue to build strong brands and then innovate more aggressively and we feel really good about the pipeline as we look forward"
968,"As you think about the category, it’s still a big category, important category is the fourth largest class across grocery"
969,And we believe and it’s highly penetrated 90% of households consume cereal
970,So we really believe in the category
971,We think there’s growth ahead
972,There are some interesting timing of things
973,"So again, if you think about the category grew nicely during the financial downturn"
974,"So between 2007 and 2012, the category grew"
975,"As the economy gradually got better and out of home eating increased, we saw the category tip the negative"
976,So we’re starting to see that moderate in terms of the in-home versus out-of-home
977,"We also know that, 30% of consumption of the category comes from boomers and older adults and that group of consumers are going to grow"
978,So we absolutely believe in the category
979,We believe that strong marketing and good innovation can drive it
980,We’re committed to doing our part and we look forward to again driving our growth as we move to the back-half and into the future
981,You too
982,"Sure, sure"
983,So a couple of things
984,"One, we really like the way we’re competing across categories"
985,"And again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’re seeing broad-based improvement across the majority of our categories and we like the way we’re competing across channels"
986,It’s really is broad-based better as well
987,"We feel like we’re winning in the majority of our channels, so that feels really good"
988,"As we think about share, again, the thing that gives us good confidence that we’re heading in the right direction here is the majority of our change and improvement in trend is really coming from baseline sales"
989,"So, again, across total U.S"
990,"retail, 75% of our improvement is via baseline sales"
991,"So it’s really not a case of merchandising driving the bulk of our improvement, so it’s better marketing"
992,"And as I mentioned in my remarks, we made a pretty major change last year shifting long relationships with advertising agencies moving to some new ones and we really like that trend that we see in market and we know that is driving our business and our baselines and our innovations are better, it’s up 50% year-over-year"
993,And I can tell you that’s actually off the same number of items
994,"So, again, it’s not turning much stuff out there, it’s actually better quality"
995,So we’re really focused on competing
996,We’re focused on the fundamentals
997,"And we believe that if we continue to do that, we can continue to see broad-based wins across our business"
998,"Again, we feel good generally across the majority of the channels"
999,"And again, without calling off specific customers, there’s this puts and takes"
1000,"But the reality is, we’re growing share across all channels"
1001,"And I think for us right now, that’s the focus to compete wherever we are"
1002,So I’m not going to – there’s not one that jumps out of me
1003,"Again, we feel really good about how we’re trending in all of them"
1004,I’ll give you a few thoughts on Wii
1005,"So, again, we’re really pleased with the results there"
1006,It’s about 1.5 share of the category already
1007,We expect that to continue to increase
1008,"And for year one, again, we expect this to be in north of $100 million in sales"
1009,"So, again, it’s off to a terrific start"
1010,"We’re seeing really good repeat rates and consumers are telling us that they view us very, very unique"
1011,"In terms of how we got there, I’m really proud of we"
1012,"And again, let me just start by saying, we know there’s a lot more work to be done in yogurt"
1013,"So we’re not taking any victory laps in that category, to be clear"
1014,"But I like the way that, that seems really operating"
1015,They’re focused on playing our game and then looking for opportunities and segments that are going to be growing in the future and bringing fundamental innovation
1016,"And we did it in a really scrappy way, innovating quickly and closely with consumers is truly is consumer-first innovation"
1017,"And by being in market and iterating over time, we’ve got to a product that we know really resonates with consumers really works hard"
1018,"So the actual process that we used to create, we were actually moving across overall use in the U.S"
1019,", really around the world to make sure that we move more quickly and make sure that we’re connected as closely to the consumer as we can"
1020,And we believe that’s going to help our pipeline as we move forward and make our innovation even more impactful
1021,"Sure, Steve"
1022,"The categories through key season is growing, so that’s good overall"
1023,"And, again, for the rest of the strong share, which we like"
1024,Similar to some of the other businesses what we really like that 80% of our improvement in trend in soup is actually coming from baseline sales
1025,"So, again, it’s fundamentals, it’s good marketing"
1026,"Now we’ve got a little bit of innovation with the progress of organics, it’s working for us as well"
1027,"So, again, like many of the other categories, it’s about fundamentals and competing well"
1028,"And if we do that, we think that we can be successful and drive the category"
1029,"And again, through key season, we’re seeing the category grow and it appears to be healthy and we’re having good constructive conversations with the retailers around it"
1030,So we’d expect continued growth through the back-half of the year
1031,"Good morning, everyone"
1032,"Thanks for joining us, today"
1033,"I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO"
1034,"When Rick is finished, we'll have a Q&A session"
1035,"So reported growth was 11.2%, which reflects strong organic growth and the Waterpik acquisition"
1036,We're very pleased with the organic sales growth of 3.2%
1037,That was driven by 7.1% volume growth domestically
1038,"Our targeted investment spending has translated into share growth, as 7 out of our 11 power brands exceeded or met category growth"
1039,Both the International Consumer business and the Specialty Products business turned in really strong numbers
1040,We're on track to achieve 8.5% full year earnings growth
1041,Our International Consumer business exceeded our expectations with 6.2% organic growth
1042,"As you know, we continue to invest in our international business to sustain our long-term algorithm of 6% organic growth"
1043,"Last year, we opened new offices in Singapore and Panama to support our export business"
1044,"In August of this year, we established a new subsidiary in Germany to expand our European business"
1045,"And over the last 12 months, we have been taking a hard look at Asia and the best approach to that region"
1046,There will be a lot more to come on this topic in the future
1047,Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 7.5% organic growth
1048,dairy farm profitability remains at a higher level than a year ago
1049,We are starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle
1050,The acquisition of the Agro BioSciences business earlier this year is an important building block for animal productivity business
1051,We've seen good growth for the probiotics products – that's a tongue twister
1052,We have seen good growth for the probiotics products in the poultry industry and our new business development efforts in the dairy industry are translating into new sales
1053,"Turning, now, to some of our domestic categories, the laundry category declined 30 bps in Q3, driven by higher promotional levels and slower unit dose category growth, yet our laundry business grew 380 basis points in consumption"
1054,"Once again, we were able to grow share in the quarter"
1055,"That momentum has carried into October – and by the way, October promotional levels have also come back in line"
1056,ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 31st consecutive quarter
1057,OXICLEAN laundry detergent gained share sequentially with improved efficacy claims and packaging
1058,"And now, finally, unit dose, behind our new Triple Chamber unit dose innovation, our consumption has outpaced the unit dose category rate for the sixth consecutive quarter"
1059,"In Q3, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew six times the category rate"
1060,"Our total unit dose share, all in for all brands, is now 4.9%"
1061,"In litter, the clumping litter category grew 4.6%, and the ARM & HAMMER consumption grew 5.4% and gained share"
1062,"Our new litter innovation, SLIDE, has already reached 4% share (3:47) of the clumping litter segment and we grew share 60 bps in the quarter"
1063,"SLIDE has a greater six-month repeat customer purchase rate than the last 14 category launches that we've had, except for Clump & Seal, which is slightly better"
1064,"So, we feel good about the future of the SLIDE product"
1065,The dry shampoo category grew 33% in Q3. The dry shampoo category is now $140 million in the U.S
1066,BATISTE grew 9.5 share points to a 33% share
1067,"BATISTE has the strongest brand loyalty of any dry shampoo in the category, including brands with significant hair care heritage"
1068,"Now turning to gummies, the adult gummy category grew 13% in the quarter, while our business grew consumption approximately 2%"
1069,"vitafusion, which is our adult gummy business, is contending with significant competitive discounting"
1070,There's been a lot of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins
1071,"We haven't been participating, so that's been slowing our growth"
1072,The condom category declined in consumption by 2.7% in the quarter
1073,"TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down, although some of that is offset by online consumption"
1074,"As we discussed in our Q2 call, younger people are having less sex, plus we're seeing an increase in use of non-latex condoms"
1075,Innovation is always a catalyst to category growth
1076,"Our new XOXO condom, which is geared towards women, is going very well"
1077,"Finally, we closed the Waterpik acquisition in the quarter"
1078,We were attracted to Waterpik because it has a bright future as consumer awareness of the importance of gum health continues to grow
1079,Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year
1080,"We said on prior calls that our – the three big brands that generally drive the international business are STERIMAR, BATISTE and – I forgot the third one"
1081,"STERIMAR, BATISTE and FEMFRESH"
1082,"In addition to that, in North America, ARM & HAMMER has been growing really well for us, ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, both in Canada and in Mexico"
1083,"You know, as far as the business goes, the business is extremely healthy and we've had broad-based growth across virtually all of our countries in the third quarter"
1084,"As I said before, our long-term algorithm is for the international business to grow 6% annually, and we're confident that we can deliver that"
1085,"As far as my comments earlier about Asia, so Asia-Pacific is extremely attractive to us"
1086,It has a growing middle class
1087,"I mean, the countries we'd be most interested there would be Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand"
1088,"And with a growing middle class using increasing consumption of personal care products, and our products are under-represented there, so we're looking at consolidating our resources in that area, making more investments in the future"
1089,"You're only the second question in, Kevin, so you didn't miss it"
1090,"So, our categories in the first half of the year grew 1.5%"
1091,"That's ticked down a bit in the third quarter; a little over 1% for our categories, so – and we expect the same for Q4, and I think that's reflected in our full year call, up 2.5%"
1092,The other piece of that is international
1093,International has had big growth for three quarters
1094,"They're going to be much lower in the fourth quarter, and that's – it can be somewhat lumpy in international, and one of the reasons for that is because of export"
1095,"We have lots of different countries, so it doesn't always come in that evenly"
1096,"It's no reflection of our long-term expectation of international, but international will be part of the story for the fourth quarter and why we'd be a little bit short"
1097,"No, we came in at 6% – 6% and change organic for the quarter for international"
1098,"It's early – we had a big first quarter for international, so it's a little bit lumpy"
1099,"So, it'll be our lowest quarter of the year, but it's just going to fall over into 2018."
1100,"We didn't get into that level of detail as far as the net sales growth in the quarter, but what I can say is – what we had said is it's going to grow above our evergreen target of 4%"
1101,The business did perform well in August and September
1102,"So, we think that this business is going to be a big part of our story going forward"
1103,"Some things we've learned, it's a very innovative culture; 20% of the business is online, which might be astonishing to you"
1104,It's sort of very sophisticated in how to sell online
1105,"I would think international is a big opportunity, because only $50 million of their business is international today"
1106,"And of course, we have a $700 million business in international"
1107,"So, we have a lot of leverage that we can help those guys grow their business"
1108,"So, it's – we're very happy with this acquisition"
1109,The integration is going very well
1110,"Integration is not dependent upon people as much as it is a focus on how we can leverage the Church & Dwight with the suppliers and, also, the networks that we have internationally to grow their business"
1111,"Yeah, tapering pricing in this environment is very difficult"
1112,"I mean, generally the only categories you're going to be taking price in is where you have a clear number one share, and even then, you need to have a story with respect to input costs"
1113,"So, that would be, for example, in condoms for latex"
1114,"So, I think price – pass-through of input costs is generally difficult"
1115,"Typically, what you see is changing in quantity sizes, in ounces and units in a package, is how you're going to get price"
1116,"Hey, Jason"
1117,"You can always ask a question, Jason"
1118,Yeah
1119,"Well, as you know, Jason, we only give our outlook every February"
1120,"So, we have no intention of giving a 2018 outlook today"
1121,"What I can remind everybody of is that we have an evergreen target of 3% organic growth, annually, and that target is based on Domestic growth of 2%, International of 6%, and Specialty Products of 5%"
1122,"And the Specialty Products of 5% is driven by the fact that, over the last couple years, we bought a couple of businesses, one was VI-COR, the other Agro BioSciences that got us into things other than dairy, so we're expecting a lot of growth from that business going forward"
1123,"Well, we're already seeing those trends in the fourth quarter"
1124,We're seeing that both vitamin consumption and condom consumption has improved from quarter-to-quarter
1125,"Now, we can – it's a little early with respect to answering your fourth quarter question when XOXO could be part of that story for condoms"
1126,"And obviously, we had some new innovation on the vitamin side of the business"
1127,"BATISTE, of course, is in dry shampoo, has been a rocket ship for us"
1128,"You might have probably heard on my comments that that category grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter and, at the same time, we grew share tremendously and we are at 33% share"
1129,That's a category that's $140 million
1130,"And if it grows as fast as the UK and where the UK levels off, it will be a $300 million category"
1131,So it gives you a little bit of color on three categories in Personal Care
1132,I think the way to think about categories is you got to look at the volumes
1133,"So, the volumes are healthy in a lot of categories, so the real story is, when it comes to dollars, it's simply price; and, that's going to vary from category to category"
1134,"And typically, it's much greater in household categories than it is in personal care, but as long as volumes stay healthy, I think that's a good barometer"
1135,"So, I don't think that the price is something that is going to last permanently, but certainly it's something we're all dealing with now"
1136,Yeah
1137,"As far as your question on Waterpik, as I said before, it's a really impressive group of people that run that business"
1138,"And when it comes to working online, it's early days, but what we've seen with respect to their development of web pages, the development of content for online, their social listening skills, the fact that they're already focused on Amazon, have sales on Amazon in Europe, they've been in it for – and more sophisticated than we've been for a number of years"
1139,"So, we do think we can learn a lot from these guys"
1140,"As far as is there any one specific category that would benefit, I mean, certainly it would be Personal Care more than Household because Personal Care lends itself more to online sales than Household"
1141,But it's a good question and we're very happy that these guys are now part of the family
1142,"Hey, Caroline"
1143,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
1144,on the acquisition – Good morning
1145,"On the acquisition contribution outlook, it just seems that the contribution was bigger than we had expected in the past quarter"
1146,"So, if you could just give us a sense from a sales standpoint whether you see that Waterpik is coming in ahead of plan? And then, staying with Waterpik, what percent of the sales come from sort of electronic – the gadget part and what percent from the replacement part that's more the annuity business, and just what's the cycle there? Just a little deeper understanding would be really helpful"
1147,Yeah
1148,"Sure, Caroline"
1149,"On the second one, in terms of the mix between units versus replacement, it's predominantly units, okay"
1150,It's a very small percentage that's replacements
1151,"That's not really as applicable at this time, right"
1152,"Maybe that'll change one day in the future, but right now, it's largely just the replacement units and it's like a three-year replacement cycle, in general"
1153,"So that's why innovation is so important, but that's also why category penetration is really the driver behind that business"
1154,"And then, your first question was on Waterpik and just the contribution"
1155,We're not going to give details of the businesses; we just don't
1156,That's not our past practice
1157,"We haven't done that with any acquisition, whether it was Avid, Orajel, or OxiClean"
1158,"I'm trying to be as clear as we can, but for EPS it's a neutral impact for the year and that's what we're going to stick with"
1159,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
1160,Got it
1161,"And then, just within the – you touched a little bit on the pricing environment and couponing, but are there any metrics you can put around what's going on in the vitamin business and just help us understand what the – how long this price war might continue?"
1162,Yeah
1163,"Well, look, when it comes to vitamins, the category is healthy"
1164,"There are a lot more competitors out there right now than when we first bought the business, so there's lots of options for consumers"
1165,"The space has expanded, as far as when you go on shelf, and the space has expended largely for the existing pill brands that are now creating gummy products and expanding gummy products, like Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Centrum"
1166,"And there's a fair amount of brand loyalty when somebody switches from pills to capsules, and BOGOs are exacerbating that transition"
1167,"So, we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs, which as I said, is affecting our ability to grow"
1168,We do have a new ad campaign right now to try to break through the noise in the gummy category and we do expect to be up in the fourth quarter
1169,"But yeah, it's concerning and something that we continue to watch, Caroline"
1170,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
1171,"Just lastly on that, is Amazon a major player there? Because one of our fears – and I think investors across the board are just wondering which categories is Amazon going to become a big private label player? And are you seeing them in any of your categories at this point?"
1172,"I mean, in gummy vitamins, we're the number one gummy on Amazon"
1173,"In fact, our shares are super high in Amazon in comparison to what they are in bricks and mortar, so no worries there right now"
1174,"Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc"
1175,"The reason for that is private label today in laundry, and has been for a long, long time, is generally mid-tier"
1176,It's not a deep value
1177,"And if you look at the long-term trends, mid-tier has been the share donor to premium and to value detergent for a long, long time"
1178,"And the reason you don't have a value in private label is because you already have deep value laundry detergent products on shelf, and so it's very difficult to make any money in deep value and come in as the opening price point below an extreme value laundry detergent"
1179,"So, yeah, private label laundry detergent really is miniscule in the U.S"
1180,I wouldn't say it's a distribution game
1181,It's really more innovation
1182,"So, the folks at Waterpik are experts in water jet technology"
1183,"And just as they have the number one share and really own the water flosser category, they also have the number one share in replacement showerheads"
1184,"So, there's – regulations typically affect the replacement showerhead business"
1185,"In other words, the number of gallons per minute, today, generally around 2.0; that's going to go lower in the future"
1186,"Question is, do you have the technology to deliver the same consumer experience that you did when you had a higher water flow? So, it's – to go back to your question, it's not a distribution game"
1187,It's really an innovation game
1188,I'll give you an example of innovation
1189,"So, one of the new products is a Pet Wand"
1190,"So, you know that more people have pets than children today, and that continues to grow"
1191,"So, it's getting behind that particular trend"
1192,"So, its translating their technology in the shower into a wand for washing your pets"
1193,"And to answer your second question, in my time with the company, we have looked at bigger transactions than the Waterpik transaction, which is our most recent one"
1194,"And as far as other structures go, yeah, we're no strangers to visitors from the major banks coming in, proposing combinations with various companies in the past through other structures, which we'd always be open to to the extent that it is going to create shareholder value"
1195,But that's about all I could say
1196,"As far as how you react to a competitor move to take price down, typically it's IRCs, immediately redeemable coupons, those are things you can act on pretty quickly"
1197,"As far as trade deals with the retailers, usually that's going to be six months out"
1198,"Well, thanks for joining us today and we'll see everybody in February with the 2018 outlook"
1199,Thanks Maria and good morning everyone
1200,"In terms of our full year 2016 results, I’ll focus my comments on organic sales on our market shares and current market conditions"
1201,Then I'll address our outlook for 2017. So starting with our results
1202,"As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were up about 2% for the year"
1203,"In developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth even though we were impacted by category declines in some markets and by price competition in China"
1204,Let's take a look at some of our key markets
1205,In Eastern Europe organic sales in diapers increased by more than 15%
1206,Results there were led by Huggies in Russia with double digit volume growth and 1 point of market share improvement
1207,"In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices"
1208,Our market share was pretty similar year-on-year in China
1209,"Looking ahead in the China market, we expect another year of significant volume growth"
1210,Category demand should remain strong and we have lots of innovation coming on Huggies including a new super premium diaper pants that we recently launched on Singles Day in November
1211,"Based on market trends in the last 2016 were cautiously optimistic that pricing in China will be less negative than 2017. Turning now to Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care were down slightly for the year"
1212,Category volumes fell throughout 2016 and competitive activity on diapers picked up in the second half of the year
1213,"Our market share for the year was down in Brazil 1 point diapers, but up 2 point in feminine care"
1214,We expect that market conditions will remain difficult in Brazil in 2017 particularly in the first half of the year
1215,"In Argentina, volumes in Personal Care were down high single digits and that’s similar to the overall category"
1216,Conditions were more challenging in the backup of the year and we're continuing to closely watch the dynamics in this market
1217,"Our adult care and feminine care businesses in developing and emerging markets had very strong organic sales growth, double digits for adult care and high single digits for feminine care"
1218,"In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were even year-on-year"
1219,"Moving now to North America, our consumer businesses achieved 3% volume growth and had excellent operating profit performance for the year"
1220,"Overall, market shares were stable year-on-year in a pretty competitive environment overall"
1221,Looking at key categories in North America
1222,In child care volumes were up high single digits with benefits from category growth and innovation on pull-ups training pants
1223,Baby wipes volumes increased mid-single digits
1224,On Huggies diapers volumes were down low-single digits while market shares were up about half a share point
1225,"In adult care, volumes rose mid-single digits aided by category growth and innovation on Poise and Depend"
1226,"Then lastly in feminine care and in Consumer Tissue, volumes in both businesses were up low single digits"
1227,Moving to K-C Professional in North America our organic sales were up 2% and we think that’s a little bit ahead of the market in that space
1228,"So overall while we experienced challenging category conditions in 2016, particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets, our market shares are broadly healthy and holding up well in this environment"
1229,Now moving beyond sales
1230,"I'm very encouraged with our performance on cost savings, margins, cash flow and return on invested capital"
1231,Results on these metrics were excellent and we’re ahead of plan across the board and demonstrating the continued strength and great execution by our business teams
1232,Finally we grew the bottom line by 5% and that’s in line with our guidance for the year
1233,Now moving onto our outlook for the coming year
1234,In 2017 we’ll continue to execute our global business plan strategies
1235,"Our teams will invest in innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to keep our brands strong"
1236,"We also continue to manage our Company with financial discipline, focusing on cost savings, cash flow and shareholder friendly capital allocation"
1237,"In terms of our specific guidance, on the top line we’re targeting organic sales growth of approximately 2% that’s broadly in line with our assumption for overall market growth in 2017. But we're expecting only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets"
1238,"But we aren’t expecting growth to pick back up significantly in 2017, we're still very optimistic about the long-term possibilities for us in these markets"
1239,Innovation continues to be an important part of our growth plans
1240,"In developing and emerging markets we've got a number of launches planned in diapers and diaper pants, feminine care and adult care"
1241,We also have a strong line up in North America
1242,"Near term activity includes upgrades on Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Goodnites Youth Pants and Depend underwear"
1243,We expect that organic sales growth will be higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of the year and that’s largely because of tougher comparisons in the first half of the year
1244,"On the bottom line we’re targeting earnings per of $6.20 to $6.35 and that’s up 3% to 5% compared to our adjusted results in 2016. We plan to achieve solid improvements in both growth and operating margins in 2017 and that’s despite an expectation for a mid-to-high single digit drag on earnings on the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices"
1245,"Our outlook also includes a meaningful decline in equity income that's driven by the weaker Mexican peso, which impacts our earnings for K-C de Mexico"
1246,"Recent spot rates for the peso have been down 15% or more compared to the average rate for 2016. In terms of capital allocation, you should expect us to continue to be shareholder friendly"
1247,We expect to allocate between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2017. That's a higher amount than in 2016 and that’s equivalent to 5% to 6% of our current market capitalization
1248,"So all in all, we remain focused on continuing to compete effectively in the near term as we execute our global business plans strategies for long term success and shareholder value creation"
1249,That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we’ll begin to take your questions
1250,Question-and-Answer Session
1251,"I think I would say, we’re going to have some carry-over price drag in places like China"
1252,"We still probably will get some additional positive price in markets like Brazil and Argentina, but we're not counting on a lot of price"
1253,In some of these markets the consumer has been pushed pretty hard and we just don't see of a big opportunity to take price
1254,And even in markets like the U.K
1255,"where you’ve had though the Brexit phenomena, we will try to take some small positive price increases, but we're not counting on a lot of that to drive our year in 2017. So I think while the currency hit isn't as big as it’s been in the past, the commodities we're assuming that oil is up double digits and secondary fiber is up double digits"
1256,"But some others like eucalyptus pulp is going to be pretty flat, but we’d just say the net of that is we're not counting on a lot of price in 2017."
1257,Both of those
1258,We’ve tend to try to innovate on the premium end
1259,We want all of our innovation to be margin accretive where ever we can
1260,"In markets like Brazil though, we are making sure we’re innovating on the low tier when the category is moving down into tier 2, you want to make sure you've got a good performing product and can make competitive claims"
1261,And so we are trying to make sure we're innovating where the consumer is moving toward
1262,"Thanks, Wendy"
1263,"Yeah so, I guess, the way I’d come out that, I’d say the marketing research general did not include advertising in that number so that would really be the cost of the marketers and any marketing research or other things"
1264,"I would say if you just looked at the quarter there was probably some more timing things particularly on our R&D where the third quarter was a little heavier than the fourth quarter, which is a little unusual for us"
1265,"But that why I probably look at the full year number to be more predictive, our advertising spend overall was pretty similar to the prior year fourth quarter, but down a little bit sequentially"
1266,So that’s not that unusual
1267,We continue to see shifts out of advertising into digital couponing and a lot of that cost gets captured between gross and net sales
1268,So you don't really get good visibility of that
1269,"But as you think about the top line in 2017, the way I would come out at it is that we're calling a roughly 2%, that's roughly what we did in 2016 on average"
1270,"2016 was very front half loaded and the back half was fairly wide as you described and 2017 from a cost standpoint, you know have tougher comps in the front half and easier comps in the back half, so I think we’re calling fairly similar overall to what we saw for the full year in 2016."
1271,"Yeah, that’s right way to think about it"
1272,"Yeah, I wouldn't say any of it, it will be much more market specific, so in places like Brazil and Argentina where there's a lot of local market inflation, not necessarily even big commodity categories"
1273,You know that they will be taking price up in those markets
1274,Will they recover all it? You know I think that’s an open question
1275,You are seeing more competitive activity in some of those markets
1276,We still have some of the carryover drag from some of the Chinese price reductions that we experienced in 2016 that will be a drag in 2017. In markets like the U.K
1277,"or in or even in North America, the level of inflation that we're seeing, we may get some pricing in case KCP around secondary fiber where we’ve got double digit price increases in secondary fiber"
1278,But I wouldn't expect to get much price on our other broad consumer categories just because the inflation level isn't that big relative to the size of those businesses
1279,The other the other thing Ali is that we feel pretty good about our cost savings going forward
1280,"And so our ability to absorb a little bit of inflation, these are fairly low inflation numbers, relative to what we've seen in the past and generating cost savings in the $400 million in a year, it gives us the ability to recover some of that and be competitive in the marketplace"
1281,"Is there an all of the above answer I can choose, Lauren on that one"
1282,Because I think it is a little bit of all of those I think
1283,There is – growth rates in a lot of our categories have slowed
1284,We said we were expecting category growth rates of roughly 2%
1285,We would have said several years ago three to four was probably more what we were trending
1286,"So growth rates have come down, there's still lots of competition including local competitors who are aggressively pursuing business and we're trying to make sure we’ve got the right innovation, we got the right price point, we’re executing well in market and that probably makes it a little tougher in this environment to get price increases, in a market like Brazil, where the category is going backwards 3% to 4% in volume and you're taking list price up, you can generate some short-term category value increases, you don't want it to be a race to zero either"
1287,There's been a pretty big category shift in the last year where training pants category growth is up strong double digits and diaper category growth is down a little bit
1288,"Since I got Mike Hsu here on his first call Mike is running North American business, why don’t you weigh in on that one Mike and give them a little color around that"
1289,So we were up a couple of percent or percent and a half or simple like last year
1290,"Yeah Lauren, it’s probably playing out the biggest in diapers and because of a couple of factors"
1291,"The non-measured, the online channels are growing at a rapid rate and so you can't see some of the customers that are in there"
1292,Also some of the changes in terms of who is reporting with whom between Nielsen RRI [ph] also going to start affecting us as well
1293,So it's a bit of a challenge right now when we're working through some of these issues too
1294,"Thanks, Lauren"
1295,"Yeah, that's a key question, Jason"
1296,"Obviously, I’d say, Latin America economic recovery would be a key driver"
1297,"So if you look at Brazil, Argentina, they’re taking a pretty big shock, but Brazil in particular from lower oil prices"
1298,As those come back that we’ve got pretty big business with down there that could tier a lot of top line growth issues
1299,"On the other hand, as you look at places like Russia, China, still very strong category volume growth and we still see big penetration opportunities in lots of markets around the world"
1300,So I think that's why we would still say long-term there’s huge opportunity here for us
1301,In the short-term we're at a little slower spot than the GDP growth per capita of range that we're going to make the categories go at a little slower rate
1302,"Yeah, well, call it other Jason, because it is just a big unknown, but no seriously, I’ll let Maria give you a little bit of color, but there’s a lot of local inflation in there"
1303,"We also have other product improvement costs would be in there, so for upgrading and adding functionality to a product we would put that into that line"
1304,"Any start-up costs for new capital equipment around the world would go into that line, I don’t know Maria, if there’s anything else you would add to that or build on that"
1305,"I would say that line tends to be pretty similar year-to-year, but I don’t know Paul, if you’ve got any other, we have never tried to forecast other, so"
1306,Pretty similar year-to-year
1307,"Each country team would have their own wage and benefit program and we just – as we break out the analysis of change and share that with you, we capture those cost increases on the other bucket and so I think that’s the nature of the question that was asked"
1308,"So we try to run a very efficient corporate overhead team and Maria oversees the corporate G&A budget and I know they're planning for a fairly flat, I don’t know if you want to comment on how you’re approaching that going into 2017."
1309,"Trust me if we were sending our operating unit teams bigger bills from corporate, we would hear about it, so"
1310,Yeah that local share seems very high to me
1311,"I mean, you’ve got essentially four big global diaper players with P&G is still the share leader"
1312,Their share is high teens
1313,Our share would be high teens
1314,"Kao would be similar and Unit Term [ph], I think it's about 10 share"
1315,Then [Hang On] which is the local players about a 5 share
1316,So I think Caroline it may depend on which dataset you're looking at their because there’s a substantial portion of the Chinese market is in e-commerce
1317,Another good chunk is in baby superstores and then there is relatively smaller segment than you might see in other markets that are in traditional retail
1318,So if you looked at a just a Nielsen traditional retail number you could probably get a high share for a local player but that’s covering a very small part of the market
1319,"Well, I think the pricing is down double digits for the year, a lot of that happened in the – started really in late of 2015, but rolled through early 2016. Our expectation is going into 2017 that pricing is not going to get better in the short term"
1320,"We do see good category volume growth, see a strong growth rate, high single digit, maybe even low double digit increase in births in China, good category participation rate"
1321,So there aren’t many markets in the world that are growing that fast and it's not surprising that that there's a lot of competition there
1322,"Our team has done a fantastic job of is improving the products and reducing our costs, so that our margins overall in China are still quite attractive"
1323,Thank you Caroline
1324,"For Personal Care, should still be the fastest growing segment I would say overall"
1325,"KCP had about 1 point drag this year on their segment organic growth due to lower sales to Halyard and some of our internal nonwovens, so that was expected because that supply agreement kind of wound down"
1326,"So we won't have that negative comp of holding them back in 2017, so KCP could be a bit higher"
1327,Consumer Tissue I'd say overall will be pretty similar
1328,Stephen Powers Okay
1329,"And then Maria if we turn to FORCE, I know there are a ton of moving parts and how you run that program from the bottom up"
1330,"But is there any way you can call out any kind of bucket of costs in particular in terms of where you saw upside in fiscal 2016, just looking back over the year"
1331,"Then more importantly, where you expect the most incremental improvement to come in 2017 because the momentum"
1332,Both based on what you achieved in 2016 and what you’re indicating that for 2017 is well ahead of where I think you would have put it a year ago at this time
1333,So I’m just trying to understand better where you're seeing that momentum sourced from? Thanks
1334,"Just a thing I would add to that is Maria and our new supply chain leader, Sandra MacQuillan, have done a great job of driving inventory down"
1335,As we have – had held less inventory you get lots of other distribution and logistics savings and that probably another area that we’ve done better and I think there's more to come there
1336,A – Maria Henry Yeah I would agree with that and I think that really helped us on the cash flow side
1337,"We put two days off of our CCC, that was in the high end of our expectations and a lot of that improvement was driven by inventory, which I'm particularly pleased with the teams are very focused on that area"
1338,"Not only global supply chain, but the local teams are really doing a great job on working capital"
1339,Stephen Powers Okay
1340,Thanks
1341,"Yeah, I mean, I’d say the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe we have enough pant capacity and so we’ve been at and that’s pretty much we’ve been adding pant capacity in major market in the world"
1342,"We got new assets in China, Brazil, Russia, Czech Republic even Central America"
1343,"And so - and our team in Mexico has also added capacity, so yeah we do feel pretty good about that"
1344,"Not to get too technical, but the grade change between the diaper and a pant would be time consuming enough, that you probably wouldn't want to do it very often, so it's better to have dedicated assets"
1345,"Yeah, I mean, I think the end game for us is deliver winning products, build market share and sustain your business over time"
1346,You know it's kind of tried and true techniques and in China we invested a ton in 2016 in our newborn program to make sure that we were capturing new moms and carrying them through
1347,We're doing a lot of hospital sampling in many markets around the world to make sure that mom goes home from the hospital with the right products
1348,And so it's all the basics
1349,"I mean, as we deconstruct some of the P&Ls to attempt of our key our competition, I think these are still attractive businesses, even at reduced prices and we've been good at getting the cost out to help protect our margins structure"
1350,"And so we want the diaper to work better and cost less and if we can continue to deliver on that, yeah, that makes it tougher for anybody to compete with us"
1351,I don’t know if that addresses it specifically
1352,"There’s another part to your question, Bill, I don’t know if I answered better or not"
1353,I think the point I would make there is that e-commerce is making pricing more transparent everywhere
1354,"So there's more – you know if retailers just to comp each other’s promoted prices and now e-commerce you can go comp three websites quick and easy and there’s apps that'll do it for you and so I think that's probably driving more of an EDLP type environment recognizing, there’s still room for some promotion"
1355,I don’t know Mike if you've got a view of that of what you see in North America
1356,"Nothing really unusual and that’s said just we were probably tightly controlling spend, but as you would hope we are always doing"
1357,But I would say no there was no unusual item that rolled through there
1358,"Thanks, Bill"
1359,"That is a left field question Nik, I think that would be the first time I have had that one"
1360,But let me answer the first question
1361,"So the global consumer I would say probably a bit of a mixed bag if you're in a economy that had oil as a large part your economy, but you’re feeling still some pressure"
1362,So now you saw negative GDP in Russia
1363,"Nigeria, certainly under pressure, very slow or negative GDP per capita growth there"
1364,Some of the challenges in Brazil have been there as well
1365,So if you're a oil consuming nation you’ve got a big windfall in 2016 and so a pretty good GDP per capita growth generally or improving
1366,"So I would say if you look at a market like China, the underlying category demand growth, the birth rate those are all really positive signals"
1367,"Despite a little bit of a little bit of a slowdown in their overall GDP growth, you still saw a really good growth in GDP per capita and more consumers coming in reach of our products and entering the category and starting families et cetera"
1368,And you’d see some similar things
1369,Vietnam is a very a good market for us as well
1370,"You saw – actually saw a very – we had a terrific year in Korea, despite a fairly flattish economy, our Korean business did pretty well"
1371,"So I’d say, the U.K"
1372,with Brexit
1373,"Our KCP business in particular saw, a little weaker year than we were expecting there"
1374,"I think you saw some distributors not wanting to hold inventory, not certain necessarily what was happening next, that seemed like that calmed down a bit at the end of the year"
1375,is more stable at the moment and we'll see what the next step is in Brexit
1376,"But I don't know Marie if you want to add anything to that, so"
1377,"A – Maria Henry Yeah, I’ll take the next one though"
1378,"Okay, go ahead, do robotics – A – Maria Henry And robotics, yeah, and machine learning in back office, yeah"
1379,We have a global business services initiative at Kimberly-Clark
1380,"We've got shared services center around the globe, where we look to consolidate and optimize transaction services and more routine type of back office work"
1381,"And robotics automation can be applied in those areas, so we are working with our vendors and staying on top of the technology"
1382,And understanding why is that opportunity for us
1383,"But clearly its part of our global business services initiatives where we're looking at robotics, automation, machine learning and how we might be able to change the game on that in the future"
1384,"Maybe just to build on that Nik, a way to think about it is if you could think about the perfect order or the perfect payables transaction or the quantity, the price, the delivery terms, everything lined up perfectly with the purchase order or it could sale right through your system and get paid without any human involvement, that would be the gold standard"
1385,I'd say too often some of those things don't work out and you need human beings to fix and adjust and correct all those minor errors that happen
1386,"And if you think about a customer transaction, if we could take the customer's order, get the price exactly right, the quantity shipped on the date they wanted it with the correct terms"
1387,So it applies right through our system and their system without any additional intervention that's a big opportunity and it takes friction out of everyone's transaction costs
1388,But we still got a long way to go to get to that
1389,"Yeah, I would say, Erin, it’s kind of a mixed bag if you looked at Russia, which has had a pretty good economic shock, we still saw a very strong a category growth"
1390,"Our Huggies business was up double digits in volume and we had higher selling prices, lot of innovation so responsive consumer to that"
1391,"Brazil on the other hand you’ve tended to see, category volume declines in the low single digits 3% to 4% over the last couple of quarters"
1392,"So that would say the consumer is either reducing their household inventory or reducing their usage in some cases or shifting from five or six diapers a day to three or four diapers a day that could account for that, if a subset of the consumer base is doing that"
1393,"Argentina has probably been the biggest shock, they’ve had a pretty big economic transformation under way, there are going to move some of their utility cost to more of a market rate and that's having a big impact on household budgets and you're seeing lots of categories declining in that market"
1394,I think it will take some time to really tell how that’s going to shake out
1395,"But we saw in the third and fourth quarter in Argentina double digit declines in category diaper volume, which, that’s pretty unusual, you don't see that every day"
1396,Yeah I think that’s true
1397,"I don’t Mike, do you want to comment on diaper pants broadly"
1398,A – Michael D
1399,"Hsu Yeah, I think we’re still digging through the data on that, but I do think, a part of it is, I would say yes right now it's about average"
1400,"I think our training pant business leaders would say, hey you know we think mom’s should be starting earlier and so there's a strategy on their part to say, hey, we want our children to start training earlier and we want them to stay more consistent in the training pant, and so that’s long-term strategy for the pull-ups brand manager"
1401,"Then for the Huggies, they want them to stay in Huggies and I think our job again here is to want to serve the consumer and how they want us to be served and give them the choices and provide the best products, so they can make the choice"
1402,Then to your point in the U.S
1403,market we're not offering training pants that go down to newborn sizes
1404,"Or as in some of the emerging markets you do find diaper pants in smaller sizes although, usually not newborn, but usually in size one, two, you find some of those are still pretty small part of those categories"
1405,A – Michael D
1406,"Hsu Yeah, training tends to start around 18 months to 24 months"
1407,Yeah and even diaper pant usage in emerging markets tends to start when babies are a little bit more active crawling stage
1408,"Yeah, I’d say, there could be a couple of mix factors"
1409,"As I said earlier in China we invested a lot in newborn in 2016, as those babies move up into the more mainstream diapers, you know we expect to see a little bit of more positive mix"
1410,And newborn hurts our mix just because there's more diapers in a bag and you sell the bag for the same price
1411,"Although you'd argue that builds your franchise, so you definitely want to have a leadership share there"
1412,But we’re probably a little overweight newborn in China and that will have an effect on us going forward
1413,"I’d say broadly we're not expecting a lot from price or mix in 2017. So I think they would both be slightly positive, but that's not going to be the story driving our growth, that’s going to be core volume"
1414,"Cadence on innovation, obviously it’s going to vary by market and so typically we've got quite a bit of stuff going on in North America"
1415,Mike I don't know if you want to comment on some of the things going on in independent polls without revealing any too much competitive launch data
1416,A – Michael D
1417,"Hsu Yeah I think the teams there, particularly in adult care were still focused on driving the category penetration, which is still a big opportunity for us, the business is performing well, up mid-to-high single digits"
1418,I think the innovation is coming
1419,"We’re really focused on that you know adding value in the category and some of things, employees within Shape [ph] and Depend in the 2016 like Depend which has been a very successful item"
1420,And then coming in 2017 new and improved super premium on Depend both real fit and silhouette
1421,"So again super premium, softer, more broadened set of performance"
1422,In China we launched a new super premium diaper pant in November and so that will really just start to get traction as we roll into of 2017.
1423,Thank you
1424,"Yeah, Bonnie, yeah, I think the environment is elevated and I think we saw an elevation occur in the third quarter, you could probably see that through in our results back then"
1425,"I think we improved in the fourth quarter, I think the team has responded well to the kind of the change in environment and ramped up their intensity in terms of both securing the right merchandising activity and the right marketing activity"
1426,"I think our call is that it’s going to remain this way for a while, and that’s what we’re assuming for 2017. I think our teams are prepared for right innovation both in diapers, child care, adult care and fem care and we’re excited about our plan for 2017."
1427,"Yeah, I’d probably say comparable, but we've got some pretty good items in there and I think we’re not ready to kind of disclose what they are yet, Paul, But I think we feel good about it"
1428,"Yeah, I would say you know wipers was a little - was flattish in the quarter and for the year"
1429,"We saw a little bit more growth in our core washroom business, so we've driven a lot of our innovation and commercial programming around the washroom and its probably refreshed that business a little bit"
1430,"We’re still seeing opportunity with wipers particularly in some of the heavy manufacturing areas, things like aeronautics and so forth, where we do a fair amount of work"
1431,So as those picked up we should see some opportunities to drive more wiper business
1432,"Yeah, no, I think that’s fair"
1433,"I guess, the way I would think about it would be; number one, as economic growth globally has slowed down and some of the markets we talked about"
1434,There's just less growth around and just as many people chasing it
1435,So that inherently will make that just a bit more competitive if you’re growing 3 to 4 and now you're growing too
1436,"And then you got the same number of competitors, it just makes – the same number of people fighting over in pieces of a smaller pie or smaller growth opportunity"
1437,So that’s probably one
1438,"I also think you're seeing more competitors, expanding into more markets"
1439,"So CNPC has moved out of Chile and is now operating in Brazil and moving into Peru and they're operating in Mexico, you know that's new geography for them and they’re obviously trying to get traction in launch"
1440,We’ve seen Unit term [ph] launch in Brazil
1441,"They haven’ t build a big share position there yet, but that increases the competitive set"
1442,"SCA [ph] has done acquisitions and increased their footprint globally in lots of places and so maybe it used to be us and our primary global competitor in a market, now you've got usually one or two other global players that are around and just makes it, so you got to be sharp on innovation, you got to sharp on cost and you got to be great on execution"
1443,"We're up for that challenge, but there's other players in the neighborhood"
1444,"I mean, I would say, this, I mean, I think the, if you think about all the weighting of those factors"
1445,"The slower economic growth is the one that’s probably, that you can't do anything about but that's probably the bigger challenge"
1446,The economies are growing better
1447,There's more growth to feed more mouths in category in particular places
1448,"And so the effect, we got more competition in more places"
1449,"At the end of day, we’ve got to deliver a winning product solution at an attractive cost and execute it well on the market and so does everybody else"
1450,So yeah I'm absolutely up for that challenge
1451,Thanks Ali
1452,"Yeah, I mean, they're pretty different markets I would say and so China is an explosive growth opportunity where more and more people as our GDP per capita improves, are entering the category"
1453,"So with billion plus, people in the country that is a near limitless supply of consumers that could eventually come into our category"
1454,"I’d say if you contrast it to Brazil, you probably had higher category penetration rates to start with"
1455,Unless GDP per capita growth and lately it’s been negative in GDP per capita trends
1456,"And so yeah, I’d just say it’s a different starting point and different economic"
1457,Ones a got great tailwind and one 's got a headwind that you're running against
1458,"We have launch diaper pants in Brazil, have seen pretty good conversion and launched things like, in adult care in our Depend, Plenitude, which is our brand in that part of the world"
1459,"We've been pretty successful at transitioning the category from a lower cost briefs, which is more like an adult diaper to a higher cost pant will much similar to what we would sell in the U.S"
1460,", just because it’s much better solution and then deliver terrific value"
1461,"Even though that is a income challenged consumer and so, you do still see responsiveness, but you don't have the explosive growth of GDP per capita and more people under in the category of that you probably have in China"
1462,Thanks Jon
1463,"Well, once again, we had a good year 2016. We've laid out an aggressive plan for our global business class strategies in 2017. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark"
1464,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning"
1465,"Before I get into the quarter, let me provide more details on the malware incident and where we currently stand in our recovery"
1466,"On June 27, like many other companies, we were globally impacted by an unprecedented malware incident"
1467,"For the last four days of the quarter and into the third quarter, we had limited ability to ship and invoice customers in many markets"
1468,"Thankfully, our teams managed to keep many of our manufacturing facilities running, which was a critical accomplishment"
1469,We executed our business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact of the incident and minimize business disruption with a focus on consumers and customers
1470,"Over the past four weeks, we've worked tirelessly to restore our systems and recover from the disruption"
1471,"Although we've now restored the majority of our affected systems, in a few cases, parts of our supply chain have still not fully recovered, and we anticipate some impacts in our third quarter"
1472,We'll also incur some additional one-time costs related to the incident during the second half
1473,"In terms of our results, the malware incident had a negative impact of approximately 240 basis points to organic net revenue, or about $140 million"
1474,"We expect to recover a majority of the delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter, and we've made good progress in shipping these orders during the month of July"
1475,"We did, however, permanently lose some revenue due to shorter supply chains, mispromotions and lost consumption in some markets"
1476,"That said, we do not believe the incident has had any long-term impact to our customer relationships or market share"
1477,We're pleased with our execution during this crisis and believe that our business continuity plans were effective in minimizing the impact to our customers and to our ongoing financial results
1478,"As you can imagine, we are conducting a comprehensive review of the incident to determine any potential opportunities to further improve the security of our global systems environment"
1479,"Currently, we do not expect the required investments to be material to our results"
1480,This event has underscored the resiliency of our team and their ability to pull together in the face of adversity
1481,I'd like to thank our teams for their tireless efforts to put us back on track and ensure that we're focused most importantly on our customers and consumers
1482,"As Irene stated, our second quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, absent the malware incident and the transition impact of the India GST, which were a combined headwind of 260 basis points to our top line growth"
1483,"Excluding these items, our organic net revenue growth would have been essentially flat"
1484,The impact of these incidents masked solid results in a number of areas
1485,"For instance, our global e-commerce net revenues continued to grow strongly, up 30%"
1486,"In Europe, we executed well overall and especially in our chocolate business"
1487,And several of our emerging markets are stabilizing and have an improving macro outlook
1488,"We're delivering solid results in countries such as India, Vietnam and Mexico, where market fundamentals are improving, and our momentum is strong"
1489,Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance
1490,Q2 marked another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion as we continued to aggressively reduce cost
1491,"Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 90 basis points"
1492,"Our progress was driven by improved SG&A as we continued to execute our Zero-Based Budgeting program, which delivered cost reductions in both overheads and advertising spend"
1493,We expect our advertising and consumer promotion spending will be about flat for the total year as we move some spending to the second half
1494,"Adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points as continued solid net productivity and better pricing were offset by unfavorable mix and higher input costs, especially in dairy"
1495,We continue to see gross margin improvements as a key enabler to delivering our 2018 margin expansion commitments
1496,"For the first half, adjusted OI margin was 16.3%, and we remain on track to deliver our mid-16% outlook for the year"
1497,"I do want to note that we decided to adjust out the incremental costs associated with the malware incident in the quarter, representing about $7 million"
1498,"As I said, we will incur additional one-time costs in the second half as well but do not expect them to be material at this point"
1499,Let me now turn to our regional performance
1500,We continue to see solid trends underlying the results in three of our four regions
1501,Europe posted another strong quarter of margin expansion with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 220 basis points to 19%
1502,"Strong net productivity, lower A&C costs and continued overhead reductions drove the improvement"
1503,"Organic net revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 220 basis points due to the malware incident"
1504,"Despite this impact, Europe delivered solid vol/mix growth in both chocolate and biscuits, and our chocolate business performance was led by Germany and Russia"
1505,"Our Europe business continues to demonstrate solid operating performance, and we remain encouraged by additional growth opportunities, including in chocolate bakery and chocolate seasonals"
1506,"In our large and diverse EMEA region, we continue to navigate through a mixed environment"
1507,Our Asia Pacific business delivered solid results while some of our markets in the Middle East continue to be challenged
1508,"Adjusted OI margin increased 230 basis points to 15.6%, driven primarily by lower A&C spend, continued overhead management and a property insurance recovery"
1509,"In markets like the Middle East, we've selectively trimmed A&C spending where returns have been challenged"
1510,"Organic revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 90 basis points from the transition impact of the India GST and the malware incident"
1511,"Despite those impacts, we delivered strong results in India and Southeast Asia"
1512,Our India business grew mid-single digits despite the impact from GST
1513,"Excluding this headwind, growth would have been double-digit"
1514,"Chocolate continued to be strong as we executed our plans, and the overall market conditions remained good"
1515,"China posted a small decline, driven primarily by soft category trends"
1516,"Our gum business continued to grow and take share, and Milka chocolate performed in line with our expectations"
1517,We expect our biscuit business trajectory to improve as we relaunched Oreo this summer with both improved packaging and a new product formula
1518,"Difficult economic conditions in the Middle East continue to pressure category growth, but our year-over-year comparisons are easier in the second half"
1519,"In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 530 basis points to 14.3%, primarily driven by improved overhead costs and lower A&C spend, as we continue to adjust our spending levels to match the market dynamics in countries like Brazil and Argentina"
1520,"Organic net revenue declined 0.5%, including a negative impact of 280 basis points from the malware incident"
1521,"Mexico delivered solid growth, driven by strength in candy while Argentina implemented pricing to offset currency-driven inflation"
1522,Brazil remains challenging due to continued economic weakness
1523,"Our chocolate business delivered a third consecutive quarter of growth and solid share performance, while our biscuits business continued to face difficult price gaps and consumer down trading"
1524,"Consistent with our discussion during our first quarter call, our North America results were challenged in Q2 as overall category growth was even lower than our tempered expectations"
1525,"Adjusted OI margin declined 250 basis points to 19.2%, driven primarily by benefits in the prior year related to an asset sale"
1526,"It's important to note that of all of our regions, the North America region was most impacted by the malware incident, driven by the lower trade stock levels associated with DSD"
1527,"As we've said, this is also the market where we had the majority of our lost consumption due to the July 4 holiday timing"
1528,"Organic net revenue declined 8%, including a negative impact of 410 basis points from the malware incident"
1529,These results were driven by U.S
1530,"biscuits, as well as declines in gum"
1531,"As Irene mentioned, we're moving with a sense of urgency to address the issues we've identified and feel confident this business will return to growth"
1532,We continue to expect to see improved results in the back half of the year
1533,We have a strong second half innovation agenda in North America
1534,"This includes our new Véa snacks and non-GMO Triscuit crackers, both of which launched in July as well as belVita Protein, RITZ Crisp & Thins and GOOD THiNS, which continue to gain share"
1535,Our white space Oreo Milka chocolate candy is also gaining momentum with healthy velocity and stronger peak rates as we expand distribution and capacity
1536,"In addition, our DSD-driven share gain plans are now beginning to play out as we'd expected"
1537,"As our competitor began to transition out of its DSD system at the end of Q2 and our major customers reset their shelves, we're now capitalizing by gaining displays and share of shelf"
1538,We expect this to be a key growth driver in the second half and into next year
1539,"Now, let me spend a few moments providing some highlights by category"
1540,"Snacking category growth was 1.5%, which was generally in line with our full year expectation"
1541,We're pleased that our shares have stabilized and were roughly flat for the first half
1542,You should note that these revenue growth numbers include the negative impact of the malware incident
1543,"Our biscuits business posted a revenue decline as solid performance in the UK, Japan and Germany was offset by weakness in the U.S"
1544,Approximately 80% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share
1545,"In chocolate, our business grew 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India and Brazil"
1546,We continue to see good momentum in U.S
1547,"chocolate, which is now benefiting from increased capacity coming out in the second half, as well as Milka in China, which continued to perform well"
1548,Approximately 60% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category
1549,"Gum and candy declined approximately 7% as the gum category continued to experience significant weakness, especially in the U.S"
1550,"We're planning for continued category declines while working on initiatives to stabilize share and shift focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy and mint platforms"
1551,About 45% of our year-to-date revenue in gum and candy gained or held share
1552,"Turning to earnings per share, in Q2, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.48, up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by our strong operating income growth"
1553,We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year
1554,"As you think about your models, let me remind you that our results now exclude the impact of our French confectionery and Australian cheese and grocery business divestitures that closed in April and early July, respectively"
1555,These items were detailed in an 8-K we issued last week
1556,These businesses account for approximately $530 million in revenue and $0.06 of EPS on an annual basis
1557,The divestitures improve our growth rates while we're moving quickly to remove stranded costs associated with these actions
1558,"In Q2, we returned approximately $900 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends"
1559,"As we receive cash for our two recent divestitures, we're increasing our full year expectation for share repurchases to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion"
1560,"In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend by 16% and are now targeting to grow our dividend faster than adjusted EPS as our improving free cash flow generation enables us to continue to fully fund our critical growth and transformation investments while also deploying more capital to shareholders"
1561,Now to our outlook
1562,"Overall, our outlook is unchanged for the full year"
1563,Our organic net revenue growth target remains at least 1%
1564,We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis
1565,"As you think about your models for the next two quarters, remember that Q4 is seasonally a higher revenue quarter and will be higher than Q3 even after the impact of the additional malware incident related shipments"
1566,"You'll note that we're absorbing the dilution from the two divestitures, but we're also adjusting our outlook for interest expense for the year, and the two items roughly offset one another"
1567,"And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year as we see lower CapEx, improved margins and good working capital efficiency"
1568,"With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments before we take your questions"
1569,"Hey, Andrew"
1570,"And I think, Andrew, as you look at some of the July data, it will be a little messy because of some of the malware shipment timing issues"
1571,"But again, at the individual retail or account level, we feel very good about the progress"
1572,"Hey, Chris"
1573,Yeah
1574,"Look, you're talking globally?"
1575,"Yeah, look, there's no question as we think about the second half"
1576,So you can do the math on what we need to do in the second half to get to at least one
1577,That's still – we need a good second half
1578,"The malware incident has created a headwind, and I would say it does make that target a little bit tougher as we talked a little bit about some of the third quarter challenges"
1579,But I'll give you a few reasons to believe that we feel good about the second half
1580,Three of our four regions are actually executing well and don't really need a significant change in trajectory as we look at the second half
1581,The second thing is we will ship through the majority of the Q2 malware shipments
1582,"And again, July, we did the majority of that and feel good about that"
1583,"We also, as Irene talked a bit about North America, we have good confidence in North America having a much better second half, and it's about the DSD opportunity"
1584,"It's about the pipeline of health and wellness opportunities that we're pursuing, and it's about the execution of the team as we've had leadership in place there"
1585,"So, those are really the drivers that I think we feel good about it"
1586,"There's the Véa, the Triscuit and the share gains that we'll have, and we think that will also help the category growth in North America"
1587,"And then in general, I think as you look at the second half, we have easier compares"
1588,You got India demonetization
1589,You've got some of the weakness we saw and trade stock dynamics playing out of the Middle East that I think will help us in the second half as we look at compares
1590,"So look I think we feel pretty good about the opportunity to have a much better second half, and those are the real drivers"
1591,"I think we expect – it was around 9% for the first half, which is slightly down from where we were in the first half of last year, but roughly in the range of where we've been as we look at the last six quarters or so"
1592,"For the full year, I would say we'll be approximately flat"
1593,"So, we will have a little bit of timing and more A&C spending in the second half"
1594,"We continue to distort that spending, obviously, to Power Brands and to markets where we're seeing the growth opportunity, and therefore, we've taken it out of some"
1595,Digital mix continues to be a priority
1596,We're projected to be at 30% of our spend on digital
1597,We still think that makes lots of sense
1598,"And again, as I said, given the innovation initiatives that we have in the back half, that will drive some of the spending that we have lined up for the second half"
1599,"You got it, Chris"
1600,"Hi, Ken"
1601,"Sure, Alexia"
1602,"Yeah, I mean, gross margins were down slightly in the quarter, and that's sort of the trend we've had over the last few quarters"
1603,"The net productivity, the supply chain reinvention work is executing well"
1604,We're delivering strong net productivity
1605,So that's not the challenge
1606,"I would say, clearly, we lost some volume leverage in the quarter as it related to the malware issue, and the pricing dynamic, pricing in general was positive, and the reality is most of that was driven by some of the inflationary economies like Argentina and Egypt, Nigeria"
1607,"Those are big, big drivers where we had significant pricing"
1608,There's a couple of places where we have seen trade spending and incremental pricing challenges
1609,You call out the U.S
1610,I would just say in the U.S
1611,", that pricing has been more or less tied to some of the DSD opportunities as we position to gain some market share and take shelf space"
1612,"Obviously, that's part of the equation and just something that we had expected to do"
1613,So we've been appropriately investing there
1614,"So again, I would just close by saying I think gross margins will continue to be a key element as we look at the margin expansion"
1615,"And again, we have a full portfolio of programs we're driving around productivity that we expect will deliver over the next multiple quarters here"
1616,"Clearly, we've seen cocoa drop, but as you know, it's more than cocoa in the portfolio"
1617,Dairy has been a challenge
1618,"Even cocoa butter has been a challenge, wheat and sugar"
1619,There're some other things moving the other way
1620,"Right now, in the first half of the year, commodities were a pressure, and they were a pressure versus what we even had in our plans"
1621,"As we go to the second half, not significant changes, as we're mostly hedged for a lot of those commodities, and dairy, as I think you know, there's not a lot of liquidity, and you can't really hedge that exposure"
1622,"So as you head into 2018, based on what we see right now, there's a bit of relief"
1623,"But obviously, you have to work through the pricing dynamics, and it's a complex equation"
1624,"But we are, as we've talked about, disproportionately moving investments and building route-to-market capability and distribution around channels that are growing faster"
1625,"So acknowledging that there are some unmeasured channels that clearly may provide more growth is something we've done and clearly, putting some investment there is part of our strategy"
1626,Consumption for Easter was – yeah
1627,We said (45:59) in the first quarter was somewhere closer to 1%
1628,So it's 1% to 1.5% is about what we're seeing pretty consistently
1629,"I think, Rob, it's still just a little bit early"
1630,I hope you can sense our optimism and positive energy around it
1631,"I think, clearly, we're in the middle of shelf resets now, and you'll start to see that play out as you move through August and into September"
1632,"And as I said a little bit earlier, there is a bit of noise because of some of the shift in timing and what played into July, and how that may have affected some of the shelf resets, and we're working through that now"
1633,But I'm not going to provide details
1634,"I mean, obviously, there's a competitive sensitivity to sharing some of that data as well"
1635,"You'll see it play out, but I think it'll play out as you get through the third quarter into the fourth quarter, I think it'll be much clearer in some of that reported data"
1636,That's what I would say
1637,"Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC So your confidence then, Brian, is because you have commitments like verbal commitments from customers to make these changes?"
1638,"In many cases, yes"
1639,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
1640,"Hey, John"
1641,"Is that chocolate specifically, Steve, or just broadly?"
1642,"Yeah, So one of the things I said in the prepared comments was we have added capacity that that's come online even in the last few weeks, and we now have the capability in the U.S"
1643,to accelerate some of our distribution expansion
1644,"So you'll see a broader footprint and a bigger market position for Oreo, Milka as that capacities come on"
1645,based capacity
1646,"We will likely, as this business grows and we continue to invest, need to have a discussion around where we put incremental capacity beyond that, and that's something that we probably phase into within the next probably 12 months as we think about that business"
1647,"But we're not there yet, and we've got plenty of capacity to drive the growth that we have for the second half and into next year"
1648,"Thanks, Fareed"
1649,We'll start with our transformation of U.S
1650,Snacks and an update on our DSD transition on slide number 16. I'm very pleased with the execution of this extremely complex undertaking
1651,"Customer feedback has been very good, and our operational metrics are all on track"
1652,"By the end of July, we were shipping completely via warehouse distribution to all customers and exiting our DCs, trucks and equipment and reducing the workforce"
1653,We are working diligently with our customer to ensure all details and issues are taken care of
1654,And I'm extremely proud of how our organization has risen to this challenge
1655,"From the standpoint of in-market performance, you saw the impact of the transition in our scanner data and we expected this"
1656,We pulled right back on promotional activity in order to facilitate the production and shipping of initial inventories to the warehouses of our customers
1657,"This resulted in sharp declines in incremental sales, promotional volume and number of displays"
1658,"Our average number of items are down, too, reflecting our SKU rationalization"
1659,"Now, as we look forward, we will see momentum build behind a more focused assortment on-shelf and fewer, but bigger, displays with an emphasis on quality positions"
1660,"All of this will be supported by significant increases in brand-building against our largest brands, as we move from push to pull"
1661,The net results of all of this will be an improvement in our in-market performance over the coming weeks and months
1662,"From a financial perspective, the transformation of Snacks remains on track"
1663,We have already begun to boost our brand-building investment
1664,"And, as you can see in our Q3 P&L, the expected overhead reductions are coming through to the bottom line"
1665,An undertaking of this magnitude isn't easy
1666,We've come a long way and we still have work to do
1667,But you're starting to see U.S
1668,Snack's future taking shape
1669,"There is no question that this will become a stronger, more profitable business"
1670,"Snack's Q3 results, summarized on slide number 17, came in as expected"
1671,Net sales were impacted by the factors we've already discussed: the list price adjustment; the pullback in merchandising; and the rationalization of SKUs
1672,"Nevertheless, we also saw a strong increase in operating profit and operating margin"
1673,"We did boost our brand-building investment in Q3, which bodes well for future performance"
1674,"And this was more than offset by a ramp-up of overhead savings during the quarter, as we reduced our workforce and exited distribution centers, trucks and equipment"
1675,"In the fourth quarter, we're working to build momentum"
1676,"We're increasing brand-building significantly, including in-market promotional support"
1677,And we expect to see an improvement in consumption
1678,"Meanwhile, we'll be close to a full overhead savings rate, boosting profit"
1679,"We'll give back some benefits from Q3, including hurricane-related shipments and some brand-building timing, but profit growth will still be very strong"
1680,"Now, let's turn to slide number 18 and U.S"
1681,"Morning Foods, where our top-line and in-market performance have been below our expectations"
1682,There are some things that have continued to work well
1683,"We've continued to gain share in kid-oriented brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops, which have brought to market innovation and brand-building that have excited consumers"
1684,And we've continued to improve our profit margins through effective productivity initiatives
1685,Where we've fallen short is on bringing enough excitement to our adult-oriented health and wellness brands
1686,This is the segment that is most holding down the entire cereal category's sales and especially ours
1687,What we have to do is get back to running the playbook that worked well for us before this year and that is working well for our kid-oriented brands to-date
1688,"So here's what we're planning for 2018. Firstly, we do have stronger commercial ideas"
1689,"We have new media that will emphasize the health and wellness credentials of Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran, two brands that simply didn't have strong enough brand-building this year"
1690,"We also launched the next phase of the Special K Own It campaign, emphasizing the brand's inner strength credentials and positioning"
1691,"And we've got great ideas for our kid-oriented brands, emphasizing out of breakfast snacking, for example"
1692,"Secondly, you will see a step change in innovation next year"
1693,"We'll renovate and innovate against our core, with news on Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops as well as more fruit-filled Raisin Bran and Special K that moves into probiotics"
1694,This is bigger innovation activity than this year
1695,We'll also try some new things that are new to the category
1696,These will lean into health and wellness and into convenience
1697,And you will hear more about them in the months to come
1698,"Third, we'll drive bigger in-store excitement, with stronger properties and events and programs that leverage a total Kellogg go-to-market model now that U.S"
1699,Snacks is no longer in DSD
1700,"Imagine, for example, promotions and displays featuring Rice Krispies and Rice Krispies Treats together"
1701,We can now do that seamlessly for the first time
1702,We'll do these three things for Pop-Tarts as well
1703,This brand will come to market with strong food news in January
1704,And we'll follow that up with differentiated innovation around mid-year
1705,We know what needs to be done because we've done it before
1706,"Remember, we stabilized U.S"
1707,"cereal in 2015 and 2016, and we've done it this year in our other three core cereal markets, all following the same playbook"
1708,"For the rest of 2017, I don't see a change in trend for Morning Foods"
1709,"But I am encouraged by the strength of our plans and expect much improved performance in 2018. Now, let's talk about Specialty Channels shown on slide number 19. This business posted its ninth straight quarter of sales and profit growth in Q3, a reflection of continued good execution by our team"
1710,"Sales growth in the quarter was led by both convenience and foodservice channels, Specialty segments like K through 12 schools and cafeterias, with an added pickup from hurricane-related orders"
1711,"The hybrid direct and broker approach we implemented early this year is giving us greater focus on key accounts and channels, while more economically expanding our reach to new customers"
1712,And it gives us confidence in the future growth potential for this business
1713,Margin expansion continued on the strength of ZBB and RGM efforts
1714,These are important and growing channels for us
1715,And our sustained momentum reflects our continued commitment and focus to winning wherever the shopper shops
1716,Turning to slide number 20 and our North American Other segment
1717,We had signaled an improved second half
1718,"And this segment certainly delivered, with a return to top line growth in Q3. U.S"
1719,Frozen Foods sustained the momentum it started the previous quarter
1720,Eggo accelerated its consumption growth and share gains on the strength of its removal of artificial colors and flavors and the success of Disney-shaped waffles
1721,It also benefited from the exit of a competitor
1722,"This was skewed mostly to the east coast, and the brand grew even excluding this"
1723,"Our Morningstar Farms line has returned to consumption and share growth, too, reflecting focused marketing and in-store support on our core burger offerings during the summer grilling season"
1724,"Kashi Company continued its sequential improvement in the quarter, as anticipated"
1725,"Whilst we haven't completely lapped some of the distribution declines on the Kashi brand, we are seeing strong momentum in cereal share led by Bare Naked, which is now the number one granola brand in the U.S"
1726,"Meanwhile, our renovated snacks offerings are stabilizing share, as we had anticipated, with share getting back up to flat in the quarter"
1727,"In Canada, we generated continued improvement in consumption, with broad-based share gains in both cereal and snacks"
1728,This business has now lapped the elasticity impact of price increases executed last year and is showing consistent improvement as we invest behind strong commercial programming and innovation
1729,"So to wrap up North America, I'm encouraged by the way we're executing post-DSD in Snacks"
1730,I'm delighted to see our North American Other businesses turning around
1731,And we're sustaining good momentum in Specialty Channels
1732,"Cereal is a tough category right now, but we have a stronger commercial plan in place, particularly as we get to 2018. And, of course, I like what we've done to our cost structure, which has driven continued margin expansion"
1733,I'll now hand you back to John for a review of international business
1734,"Hey, Ken"
1735,"Obviously, I'm not going to talk about competitors"
1736,We're pretty much focused on doing our job and that's rebuilding momentum
1737,"And I feel good about our plan and the strength of our plan in Q4. We're reinvesting in, obviously, significant amounts of brand-building here behind a pull model"
1738,"We're reinvesting in in-store promotions behind a more focused assortment and we are driving more impactful, larger displays in key positions in stores"
1739,"When you exit DSD, you're always going to lose some tertiary and secondary displays, but the benefits of shipping through warehouse is that we can drive some big impact displays across our biggest brands as we build momentum into what will be a strong Q1 as well from an innovation point of view and our ability to leverage the Power of K in-store going forward across one delivered platform"
1740,So we're focused on getting the momentum back in our brands
1741,And our plans look very strong year-to-go
1742,"As it regards Morning Foods and cereal, specifically, we're not seeing points of distribution or things happen at a category level, per se"
1743,"We are, obviously, disappointed with our performance this year"
1744,And we're not hitting our plan
1745,We're hitting our plan on many elements around kids and productivity where we're not hitting our plan has been around our biggest adult brands
1746,"And that shortfall on brands like Mini-Wheats and Special K and, to a certain degree, Raisin Bran, is what's driving a softer category performance this year"
1747,The category's going be down between 2% and 3%
1748,"And some of that, quite frankly, is on us"
1749,"We need to now pivot and reassert our health and wellness credentials on those adult brands, increasing claims, news and innovation around those brands as we go into next year"
1750,So I've mentioned probiotics on Special K
1751,We have news coming on Raisin Bran
1752,And one thing we'll talk to you about in coming months is some more transformational innovation coming to the category around the area of digestive health and convenience as we look to really stimulate adult growth within the cereal category
1753,"As you go back over time, this category has always responded, over the past 50 years, to health and wellness, whether it was fortification, fiber, oat bran, low calorie, low fat in the 1990s and 2000s"
1754,We need to drive the health credentials of the category
1755,"And that's what our plan is as we go into next year, whilst continue to drive fun and taste and versatility, and, as John said, big consumer excitement engagement through big properties and fun in-store"
1756,So that's really where we're headed
1757,And I'm very much focused forward right now on those things
1758,"Hey, David"
1759,It's Paul
1760,"It's hard for me to give you a sense of the exact volume declines, but remember what we said coming into this"
1761,"There is a 50% to 20% SKU rationalization that will obviously not have that amount of impact on our business, but will have a limited impact"
1762,We hope to gain space on some of our core items to get a more powerful assortment there
1763,"At the same time, we said and we knew we would get fewer displays as we came out of DSD but more impactful displays"
1764,And we pulled right back on promotions and display support through a period of three to four months here to be able to operate effectively in what is a new model for the Snacks team
1765,We have now pivoted
1766,"Brand-building was up in Q3 and will be up much more in Q4. Our investment in promotions and in-store support with our customers is now beginning to come to life as we reinvest behind these biggest brands, and that will continue as we go into next year"
1767,I'm optimistic we will see consumption improvement in the coming weeks and months on this business
1768,"We have a strong innovation pipeline coming at the beginning of the year, so that will accelerate into next year from a consumption point of view"
1769,"So we're now, if you like, the transition is behind us in many ways"
1770,"We're now very much focused on operating effectively in a warehouse-delivered model, which we think we can do because we do it across our other businesses"
1771,"It's a good question, David"
1772,Our business is responding in the way we expected it to
1773,So all of our key metrics are right where the team expected them to be
1774,"It takes a lot of work in-store to make sure tags and placement and compliance is there across 20,000-plus stores, which we used to call on twice a week"
1775,"But so far so good, and we'll continue to improve as we go forward"
1776,So there's nothing outside of our assumptions in our business case at the moment that would worry us
1777,"Like I say, we're just focused on getting back to growth with our customers and then obviously working with our customers in a new delivered environment, where we can also help them from a cost to serve point of view as we're on one platform now and build those joint value-creating plans in ways that we couldn't before, which I think will be really important looking forward"
1778,"Absolutely, Brian"
1779,"When we laid out the business plan when we started this at the beginning of the year, this was really based on a set of consumer-based and shopper-based assumptions, which is exactly what you said"
1780,"Investing money in a go-to market mechanism or operating model, the consumers don't see the benefit from, quite frankly, was not where we wanted to be"
1781,So those resources are now going into focusing on how and where the shopper shops
1782,"Whether that's brand-building in old-fashioned ways or new-fashioned ways from a shopper point of view, reaching those shoppers in whichever retail environment they choose to shop, that's exactly what we're doing"
1783,"We're also investing more resources, people resources, against where the growth channels are in our business"
1784,"So we're seeing, for example, eCommerce in North America in Q3 grew over 60%"
1785,"So like every company, winning where the shopper shops in new environments, be that pure play or click-and-collect is right up there on our agenda"
1786,"And investing in capabilities, whether it be supply chain, marketing, sales in that environment, is where some of these dollars are going"
1787,"Also remember some of the highest growth potential brands in our portfolio, Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, these brands are going get significantly more brand-building, way up there in the double digits for the next year, as we look to accelerate those brands"
1788,"Whether that's TV, media type investments, whether it's customer focused investments, whether it's capital into pack/price format investments to make sure that we have exactly the right offering in the right channel to fit the consumers and the shoppers' needs"
1789,"What we said we're doing, we're going to do, and you'll see it come through in the months to come into next year"
1790,"Thanks, John"
1791,"As I look forward on our portfolio, as I emphasized, it's less about absolute money or share of voice as it used to be"
1792,It's more about getting the right ideas behind the right brands
1793,"We have a great set of existing core brands, the Core 6, as we call them"
1794,"They cover 70% of the needs when it comes to the category, number one"
1795,"We have to up our game on brands like Mini-Wheats, Special K, and Raisin Bran to bring, as Steve said, contemporary health and wellness credentials to those brands"
1796,We're down the track on Special K
1797,"And we're seeing the brand begin to respond, not only in the U.S"
1798,but around the world
1799,"And we're bringing more, in the way of probiotics to Special K next year"
1800,"Raisin Bran and Mini-Wheats, we can do a lot more to pull out the wellness credentials of those brands and talk to consumers about them"
1801,"This isn't category work, per se"
1802,"This is brand work relevant to consumer needs, brand-on-brand"
1803,"I've spoken before about how the category's always been driven over time, actually through nutrition"
1804,"Whether it was fortification back in the 1950s, fiber, oat bran in the 1970s and 1980s, and then for a long while here, low calorie, low fat drove the Special K brand in particular and the category for years"
1805,"Now, I believe gut health and science is coming back to nutrition and nutrition in the cereal category"
1806,We're well placed as a category to actually find tailwinds in nutrition in the months and years to come
1807,It's good for cereal and it's good for our emphasis on health and wellness
1808,"You add the Kashi brands and the Kashi business to that as well and we have a on-trend set of brands, I think, for the 10 years to come"
1809,"The critical thing, though, is finding great commercial ideas, renovation and innovation that can bring to life those trends in unique ways for our brands"
1810,Our portfolio and our category is uniquely placed to do that
1811,It's incumbent on us to do it
1812,So that's really where our focus is
1813,"35%,36% of the cereal consumption in the U.S"
1814,today happens outside of the breakfast occasion
1815,That trend's only increasing and will only continue to increase as you think of demographics and age cohorts going forward here
1816,And so we are agnostic to what time of day we communicate the benefits of our foods
1817,"And we'll communicate to everybody, wherever they are throughout the day, these benefits"
1818,"We've had great success with some of our kid brands against millennials in certain dayparts, like the evening, and we will continue to drive our portfolio where it makes sense to fit people's days"
1819,"The final thing I'll mention is we do need to still bring transformational innovation to cereal, okay, and to the breakfast occasion, which means investing more, maybe, in new alternatives in the area of digestive health and/or convenience"
1820,And we're working hard on that
1821,"And hopefully, you'll see some transformational innovation ideas come out of our company over the next few months here that show that we are investing to grow our business across these key categories"
1822,"Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone"
1823,"Since Maria covered the financial details for the quarter, I'll focus my comments on our organic sales in the quarter and then on our full year outlook"
1824,"As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales were down 1% in the quarter"
1825,"So, in January, we said that growth would be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half largely due to comparisons"
1826,"That said our first quarter organic sales were somewhat below my expectations, most of that coming from North America"
1827,"In North America, our organic sales fell 3% in our consumer businesses, and that reflects the combination of category softness, greater competitive activity, and lower promotional shipments"
1828,"Overall category growth across all channels, including e-commerce, was about 0.5% in the quarter, and that's about 1.5 points below what it was for the full year 2016. In terms of our key businesses in North America, our Personal Care volumes were off by 1%"
1829,"In infant and child care, our volumes overall were down low-single digits, which is probably in line with the mega category"
1830,"Category consumption continues to shift out of diapers and into training pants, and volume growth in e-commerce is continuing to accelerate"
1831,Our market share overall was even year-on-year and up 1 point sequentially in infant and child care
1832,"In Consumer Tissue, our volumes were down 7%, mostly in bathroom tissue"
1833,Results were impacted by competitive activity and lower promotional shipments than last year
1834,We've got a stronger promotional calendar scheduled for the balance of the year
1835,We expect better performance going forward in North America particularly the back half of the year when our comparisons get a little easier
1836,Our planned product innovations will also help drive our growth in the near term
1837,"That includes the introduction of U by Kotex Fitness in our feminine care business, improvements to Huggies diapers and baby wipes, and some new Kleenex facial tissue offerings"
1838,"In addition, we're placing even more focus on the execution of our sales and retail merchandising strategies with stronger programming going forward"
1839,"In terms of the category overall, trends were a little better in the last part of the first quarter, so we're cautiously optimistic that market growth will get back to more normal levels over time"
1840,"Moving onto developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth in this part of our business, and performance and category conditions were broadly in line with our expectations from January"
1841,"Looking at some of our key markets, in China, organic sales in diapers were up low-single digits as strong double-digit volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices"
1842,"While the promotion environment remains competitive, we're optimistic that pricing won't be as negative in 2017 as it was in 2016. We also have several innovations on Huggies launching in the second quarter"
1843,"In Brazil, our organic sales in Personal Care were up high-single digits compared to a decline of 5% in the year-ago period"
1844,Category demand remains down in Brazil and our team there continues to innovate and has product improvements in market on diapers and feminine care
1845,"In Argentina, our organic sales in Personal Care were up low-double digits, driven by higher selling prices"
1846,We re-launched Huggies diapers late in the quarter and that helped us deliver modest volume growth despite category volumes being down double digits
1847,"At Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers were similar year-on-year"
1848,Volumes were up double digits again this quarter with continued benefits from innovations in Russia
1849,"Selling prices were down, reflecting price rollbacks last year following the strengthening of the Russian ruble"
1850,"Lastly, in developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were down 2%, mostly in South Korea"
1851,We expect results there to pick up as the year progresses including benefits from innovation launches
1852,"Now, moving onto our outlook and our specific targets for the year; we expect sales to increase 1% to 2% in 2017. The currency impact on sales should be neutral overall, which is about 2 points better than what we expected in January"
1853,"Regarding organic sales, we also expect growth of 1% to 2%, and that compares to our original estimate of approximately 2% and reflects our first quarter results, the category conditions in North America, and slightly lower price realization due to improved currencies"
1854,"Regarding earnings, while the currency outlook has improved, our cost inflation estimate has increased by $75 million on average compared to our assumption in January"
1855,"In total though, we're still planning that the net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices will be a mid-to-high single digit drag in our bottom line"
1856,That's consistent with our original plan for the year although with a different mix of these factors
1857,"Altogether, we continue to target earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.35 for 2017. And that's up 3% to 5% year-on-year"
1858,"So, in summary, we're investing in our brands and growth initiatives to help us grow and compete effectively"
1859,We're managing our company with financial discipline
1860,And we continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to create long-term shareholder value
1861,"That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions"
1862,Question-and-Answer Session
1863,"Good morning, Lauren"
1864,"I'll let Mike Hsu give you a little bit more color on that, but we've certainly seen a pretty strong uptick in e-commerce"
1865,"And that's a trend that's happening in lots of places, but it did seem to accelerate in the U.S"
1866,in the last couple of quarters
1867,"Yeah, go ahead, Mike"
1868,"And, Lauren, fem care was down, I think, mid-singles, and part of that's timing of launch"
1869,We've got the fem care U by Kotex Fitness launch coming
1870,That starts in the second quarter
1871,So we expect to see a little stronger calendar in the back half of the year
1872,"Thanks, Lauren"
1873,"Hey, Wendy"
1874,"Yeah, Wendy, I guess a couple of things I would say"
1875,"Number one, giving you an accurate e-commerce or online versus off-line share is pretty tough for us to do because there's a lot of our traditional brick and mortar customers that do quite a bit of click-and-collect"
1876,And so we don't really have any visibility of that because it goes into their existing distribution system and into their existing stores and they take off their shelves
1877,So Amazon will be a big one that isn't in the tracked data that probably is the gap
1878,"And maybe – and again, they've had a strong quarter across lots of businesses, including ours"
1879,"And I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment any more about anything that you're seeing in that specific space?"
1880,I guess I would just call it – if you look at the North American price was pretty neutral quarter-on-quarter
1881,So that would be an indication that we're not funding additional competitive spend activity
1882,"Yeah, if you look at the pricing in Q1 versus fourth quarter last year was pretty similar"
1883,So we didn't really see further degradation
1884,All the price decline was a carryover effect of things that happened in the first half of last year
1885,So we would feel like it seems to have stabilized at this point in time
1886,And the good news is you're still seeing really strong category volume growth
1887,"And so, our pricing comps will get a lot more favorable in the back half, which gives us some confidence on our organic top line outlook"
1888,"Thanks, Wendy"
1889,"Yeah, I guess I'd say, Ali, the year started out a little slow"
1890,"Jan, Feb and March was much better"
1891,"When we look at that and the plans that we have rolling forward with some of the innovation that we've got coming, that's what gives us some confidence"
1892,Our comps get quite a bit easier in the back half
1893,So we knew the first half was going to be a tougher comparison to deliver organic growth
1894,And we've got good momentum in a lot of markets around the world
1895,"I'd say the two factors were probably – and the call down of the top line was a little slower start in Consumer Tissue in North America, and then some price rollbacks in markets where there was pretty big price recovery last year and no other currencies have strengthened"
1896,"So Brazil and Russia in particular have been places where the currency was pretty weak last year, and we took a lot of price and some of that snapped back"
1897,But we'll give you an update as the year progresses
1898,"We call it, as you know, down the middle of how we see the fairway, and we'll keep updating as we go through the year"
1899,"Yeah, I guess we would say that 1% to 2%, we still feel like relative to our long-term goal of 3% to 5% reflects some of those secular challenges"
1900,Yes
1901,"In fact, Mike, maybe will comment on this because he's taking a refreshed look at the long-term strategic plan, which we won't unpack all the details for you this morning, but I'd say we still see strong category growth potential, particularly in a lot of the emerging markets"
1902,"So maybe, Mike, do you want to comment just a little bit on that?"
1903,"Thanks, Ali"
1904,"Good morning, Kevin"
1905,"Yeah, I think as you look at some of the price competition in China that's rolling off, what we're seeing is the underlying category has been robust from a volume standpoint"
1906,"It's just been masked by some of the price challenges, and so we feel pretty solid that that's going to continue and flow through"
1907,"There are other markets like Brazil, Argentina, where the economy hasn't yet really turned substantially"
1908,"There's still a fair amount of price recovery to go in Argentina to get back to a more equilibrium state, and so there's probably some question marks there"
1909,"On the other hand, Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe still seeing actually strong category growth there even though the economy hasn't fully recovered"
1910,"And North America, I'd say it's a mixed bag"
1911,"On the Personal Care front, we still see good category growth in adult care"
1912,We've got good innovation coming in fem care
1913,"Actually, the growth in the training pant category and out of diapers favors us given our share with Pull-Ups, so we feel pretty good about that"
1914,And Consumer Tissue is one where we just got to step up our execution a bit and make sure we're getting our fair share of that category
1915,"So I wouldn't say it's dependent on improvement in category growth, it's more sustaining what we see happening and then executing against it"
1916,"Yeah, I don't think we could probably give you an accurate read on that specifically"
1917,And I think we'd probably say we're still trying to exactly figure it out what happened with the consumer in North America in the first quarter
1918,You've seen a little bit of category weakness across lots of places
1919,"So how much of it is broader economic slowdown, which you don't seem to be seeing in other areas? The job report was a little weak but not substantially so"
1920,So that's still probably what we're trying to dial in a little bit more precisely
1921,"It's a pretty long question, Kevin"
1922,We'll do the best we can with that
1923,I guess I would start
1924,Price competition among retailers is not a new phenomena and it's maybe heating up a bit
1925,"Ultimately, finished product selling prices are retailers' responsibility and you didn't see a lot of price change in our North American numbers"
1926,So our trade programs are pretty much intact and maybe I'll let Mike comment a little bit more if you want on private label trends or the general nature of discussions there
1927,"I will say this though that when you've got good innovation and strong brands (29:14), it leads to a different discussion than if you don't have those things, it becomes more of an item price discussion"
1928,"Thanks, Kevin"
1929,"Yeah, I guess I'd say, and maybe Mike can comment a little bit more on North America, but I'd say our overall plan in North America hasn't changed much"
1930,"We just didn't get it all executed in the marketplace in the first quarter, particularly in Consumer Tissue, and so our plan for the year hasn't changed in terms of what we plan to spend broadly"
1931,"I don't know, Mike, is there anything else you want to add to that or?"
1932,"And then on the commodities inflation, it's not enough to drive finished product selling prices in most places, and particularly, when you see many of the international markets, the currency turning favorable, it's not a calculus that would lead to a lot of price in markets like that"
1933,"We are getting some pricing in – where secondary fiber has gone up quite a bit in K-C Professional, we're getting some price recovery"
1934,I think there's been more broad price increases across the industry that have been announced recently and so that will give us some benefit
1935,But that's about the only one that I can think of that there's maybe a direct commodity driven price change that we'd see coming this year
1936,"(32:54), Olivia"
1937,"Well, we would say brilliant leadership would be right at the top of the list, but jokes aside, we had a great cost savings quarter"
1938,"$110 million in FORCE cost savings, a great way to start the year"
1939,And then that certainly was a driver of that
1940,"Good mix of negotiated material savings, pretty good productivity, some of this material specification changes, then an increasing element of that bucket is in some of the distribution and logistics related savings"
1941,"I know Maria's a fan of this to see our inventories keep coming down and that not only delivers cash, but also delivers cost savings as we've got less stuff to store and handle"
1942,"I don't know, Mike, if there's anything else you want to build on that?"
1943,"I would say there aren't that many tuck-ins internationally, but there are a few in a few places, but we did a lot of that in the 1990s and really bought up a lot of the market positions that we wanted and we've been able to consolidate some joint ventures into being 100% owned over time"
1944,And so it's a relatively light calendar of M&A activity
1945,"And yeah, we read all the same chatter that you guys read and, quite honestly, we're more focused on running our own business every day and stay pretty focused on that and don't play too much with the speculation process on what might happen"
1946,"So, I think so far that's served us well"
1947,"Thanks, Olivia"
1948,"Yeah, in terms of retailer inventories, we didn't see a big shift anywhere really, and we have pretty high cube, high velocity categories, particularly in a place like China, where so much of it is e-commerce"
1949,Often the e-com players really aren't even holding any inventory
1950,They'll pick up at our distribution center and deliver the same day
1951,"And so there's not a lot of inventory in those systems, and I know we've seen some minor shifts in inventory across other channels, but nothing that was significant enough to call out in the quarter"
1952,"Thanks, Andrea"
1953,Okay
1954,"I'll do the best I can with that, Steve, and we'll see, Steve, what I leave left for you to follow-up on"
1955,"In terms of pulp and oil, we'd say for pulp we're probably up $40 to $50 a ton versus our original guidance in terms of we expect in terms of market pricing for eucalyptus"
1956,So we're calling euc at $870 to $900 a ton
1957,"And I know the current price is above that, but that's kind of our outlook for the year"
1958,"Oil we're kind of in the $50 to $60 a ton still, and there may be some upside for us on that depending on where oil shakes"
1959,"In the meantime, though polymer has actually gone up a bit, as there's been some supply challenges on polymer"
1960,And we don't have a lot of direct oil
1961,"We do a lot more polypropylene and oils short of the long-term proxy for that, but in the short term, they can go different directions"
1962,"Swinging to the market share front, if you looked at shares sequentially in North America, they're pretty flat; up in a couple, flat in a few, down in a couple"
1963,"Year-over-year, particularly in Consumer Tissue is where we had the most negative share comparison"
1964,So that was probably a high watermark for Consumer Tissue last year
1965,"As you travel around the world, I'd say you'd see relatively stable share positions"
1966,"Brazil is up in fem care, down a little in diapers; similar story in Argentina"
1967,"China shares were, I think, pretty flat to down 1-point; Korea, kind of a similar story"
1968,"Positive shares in Russia, Ukraine, other parts of Eastern Europe on diapers in particular"
1969,"I don't know, Mike, if there's any other ones that jump out for you? Fem care has probably been our star and that we've had very strong share performance in most markets on fem care"
1970,I think that's a fair statement
1971,"When we get done with this call, Mike and I are going to go in and talk to our team leaders around the company"
1972,And one of the things we're going to tell is we're not satisfied with our market shares in the first quarter
1973,So we'd expect to do better as the year progresses
1974,"Thanks, Steve"
1975,All right
1976,"Maybe I'll have Mike comment on both of those, so on promotional environment broadly and then facial pricing"
1977,I'm not aware that there's been any change on their end
1978,Yeah
1979,"I think the other point, Nik, would be, as we've got innovation coming, you want to use your promotion along with your other strategic marketing tools to drive that"
1980,"So we've got a pretty strong calendar coming, and so that wouldn't be unusual for us to put more money behind those ideas either"
1981,"No, I wish I could tell you the clear answer, because then I would have done something about it before now"
1982,But it was – and I think everybody was talking about retail store traffic was down broadly
1983,They can't point to weather
1984,There was theories about late income tax refunds
1985,"Again, I don't know why that would necessarily affect our category"
1986,"But, on the other hand, if you're not in the store shopping, you definitely saw that in terms of retail traffic"
1987,Now there was some uptick in e-commerce that balanced off a part of that
1988,"We are seeing probably, I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment on this, just a little bit less in terms of the fill-in trips may be part of it as some retailers unpacked that"
1989,But I think it's still pretty early to figure out exactly what happened
1990,"Thanks, Nik"
1991,"Good morning, Bonnie"
1992,"Yeah, I think on China, a lot of the pricing was really led by some of our other international competitors over the last couple of years almost, and some of that was probably funded by a weaker yen"
1993,But I think that seems to have normalized
1994,"In the meantime, this is one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and it's not surprising to see everybody chasing after that consumer growth"
1995,"And so right now, you've got two big U.S"
1996,-based players and two big Japanese-based players all chasing growth in the Chinese market
1997,"And I think the good news is that pricing seemed to have stabilized in the quarter, although it was down year-on-year, reflecting some of the things that happened in the first quarter last year"
1998,"On the Brazil front, part of it was we had a lousy start last year in the first quarter, so our comp was easier in that market, and that was why our volume uptick was there"
1999,"I'd say the shares we've seen in that market are just Jan, Feb, and we had a stronger March, so you could've had a situation there, where maybe shipments were even a little bit ahead of category consumption"
2000,But we'll see when we get the next share data
2001,"I don't know, Mike, if there's anything else you want to add on either of those markets?"
2002,So if you have slower growth and you've got lots of competitors facing it that sometimes results in higher promotional environment
2003,"And so you're also seeing retailers get creative across the space in terms of do more with click and collect and there's a lot of innovation happening, not just around price, but also around service and how shoppable the categories are in different environments"
2004,And so I will expect that that will continue as we roll forward
2005,"I don't know, Mike, if there's any other color you've got on that?"
2006,"Yeah, and e-commerce does cause great price transparency"
2007,"On the other hand, retailers have been comp shopping each other's stores in bricks and mortar for 100 years"
2008,"It's a pretty comprehensive list there so, on the promo front, maybe Mike can comment a little bit on that"
2009,"On China, I think the question was, have you seen any kind of trade up in e-com and I think, broadly, that is the case"
2010,We've just launched a super-premium diaper pant in China that we're really excited about
2011,And moms that tend to shop in e-com tend to skew a little bit higher income and so that should be a positive for us
2012,And then the last question
2013,"was tax rate, which Maria can comment on"
2014,One difference though
2015,You might be looking just that fourth quarter only working capital number
2016,"We tend to compare to the full year average, because there is a bit of cyclicality as the year rolls through"
2017,"Hey, Jason"
2018,"Jason, we don't give quarterly guidance as you know, so I think you can do the math as easy as we can and you're correct in assessing that the comps get tougher in the second quarter"
2019,"But, beyond that, I'm probably not going to give you any more color on quarterly guidance"
2020,"No, not at all"
2021,The volume actually has been pretty strong throughout and so is it's been more of a function of innovation and category growth and consumer spending power and that we expect those stronger results to come through more clearly in the back half of the year
2022,"Thanks, Jason"
2023,"Well, once again, we are continuing to execute our Global Business Plan and allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways"
2024,And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark
2025,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty’s fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year conference call"
2026,Fiscal 2017 was a transformational year for Coty
2027,"First, we completed the incredibly complicated acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, dealing with the complexities of both the carve-out the R&D structure"
2028,"Second, we fully reorganized into a product and customer focused organizational structure, centered on three vertically integrated divisions"
2029,"Third, we reached significant milestones in our integration efforts, and fourth, we strengthened our portfolio through the additions of Younique, ghd, and the pending acquisition of the Burberry Beauty license"
2030,"I am particularly proud of the culture we are building within the new Coty where we embrace the diversity of consumer beauty, focus on destruction, - and welcome the challenge of an increasingly complex beauty industry"
2031,"Equally important, we believe the strategy we outlined earlier in the year which focuses on strengthening our global brands, shifting more resources to fuel the growth of the brands with higher growth potential, stabilizing the remaining brands, and continue to expand the geographic reach of our portfolio, is beginning to bear fruit as demonstrated by the improvement in the net revenue trends in the second half of the fiscal year"
2032,So let’s begin with our performance at high level
2033,"In Q4, organic net revenues excluding acquisitions declined 3% in constant currency, which includes a 1% benefit as a result of pre-shipments to customers in advance of exiting the transitional service agreement with P&G for Europe which occurred on July 1. Q4 reflect a much improved and very good growth in both Luxury and Professional Beauty, but continued weakness in Consumer Beauty, which is a key priority for us to address"
2034,"Include the ghd and Younique acquisitions, our Q4 net revenues grew 5%"
2035,"Fiscal 2017 organic net revenues declined 5% with flat performance in Professional Beauty, a slight decline in Luxury and pressure in Consumer Beauty, including ghd, Younique and a full year of Hypermarcas Brands, net revenue in constant currency grew 1% versus the combined net revenue of the prior year"
2036,"From a profits perspective, our Q4 adjusted operating income reflected a materially higher level of investment in marketing to support the momentum in our business and to achieve flawless execution at retail for launches like Hugo Boss Tonic Gucci Bloom, Tiffany debut fragrance, CK Obsessed, as well as the COVERGIRL PDA campaign and the Clairol Colour Crave launch, all of which I will elaborate on later"
2037,Profits was also impacted by higher combined fixed cost base which I am not happy about
2038,"While some of the cost increase was a result of operating under a TSA with Procter & Gamble, where we had limited visibility and control over certain areas of fixed cost, our cost base is nowhere it should be and we are rapidly working to address this issue as part of our synergy program and organic efficiency initiatives"
2039,"Patrice will elaborate more on this point, and we will get back to you on this topic in the coming quarters with specific actions"
2040,"For the year, our adjusting operating income grew 24% with a margin of approximately 10%"
2041,"Looking at revenue dynamics by division, momentum at the Luxury division continued to improve as we progress through the year from a mid single-digit decline in the first half to low single-digit growth in the second half"
2042,"For the quarter, Luxury revenues increased organically by 5% while for the year, organic revenues declined a moderate 1%"
2043,"By brand, we have continued to see strong momentum across Hugo Boss, Gucci, Chloe and philosophy as well as several of our ultra premium fragrances such as Bottega Veneta, MIU MIU and Alexander McQueen"
2044,"For Hugo Boss, we recently launched Boss Bottled Tonic and announced Chris Hemsworth at the new face with the brand"
2045,"The strength of the key Hugo Boss fragrance pillars have agreed with share gains for Hugo Boss across a number of key countries, including Germany, the UK, France and Italy"
2046,Our momentum and philosophy with stronger net revenue growth in both the quarter and the year has resulted in the brand continue to gain share in the U.S
2047,Philosophy e-commerce presence already strong in the U.S
2048,should be bolstered by the recent opening of an online store on China Tmall website aimed on engaging young Chinese consumers
2049,"If we look to maintain Luxury momentum into FY 2018, we are excited by the brand execution plans we have in place behind the inaugural Tiffany’s fragrance and the launches of Gucci Bloom and CK Obsessed that I mentioned earlier"
2050,"While it’s still early days, all three launches are off to a good start with sell-through exceeding our expectations"
2051,"Professional Beauty organic net revenues grew a healthy 3% in Q4. I am pleased to report that in addition to the continued success of our salon hair brands, we have recently seen a significant improvement in OPI revenue trends"
2052,"In salon hair, Wella maintaining strong momentum behind this Contura collection, the Oil Reflections launch and recent launch of Wella Professional Fusion, while System Professional continue progressing on its global rollout"
2053,"In OPI, following several quarters of sales declines, Q4 net revenues were down modestly on a global basis, but resumed growth in North America"
2054,"As we look to FY 2018, we expect farther improvements in the OPI trends driven in part by the launch of the OPI Gel ProHealth System which began to rollout on August 1. OPI new gel can be removed 50% faster and without damage which means healthy looking nails after removal addressing key barrier to consumer gel use"
2055,"Additionally, new Coty Gel Colors will come in shape match bottles to improve shopability"
2056,We are very excited about the prospects for OPI new gel system targeting a fast-growing segment of the salon and nail category
2057,"Turning to Consumer Beauty, division organic net revenue declined 10% both in Q4 and for the year"
2058,"As context, the global consumer beauty industry began to decline moderately at the end of calendar 2016 in the category and countries which we compete"
2059,We can far turn the luck in the latest quarter to a low single-digit decline
2060,"As we focus on returning the Consumer Beauty division to growth over time, we are working with a significant relaunch and restage of a number of our major brands to better connect them with the changing consumer"
2061,We are actively engaging with our traditional retailer customers to amplify the in-store shopping experience to drive category growth
2062,"Additionally, we continue to focus on key specialty customers as well as driving our e-commerce footprint"
2063,"Against this weak market backdrop, Coty Consumer Beauty net revenue have been farther pressured by the shelf space losses in the U.S"
2064,and Europe as discussed in the last earnings call
2065,"Nevertheless, in the quarter, we are seeing strong performance in a number of our key emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico and the Middle East"
2066,"In Brazil, the acquired Hypermarcas Brands are growing in the double-digits with our Brazil business overall outperforming the underlying market"

2069,Bourjois remains a highlight in the Consumer Beauty portfolio with solid growth in the quarter and full year and strengthened its position in a number of fast-growing markets
2070,"Finally, Adidas performance improved with brand growth in Q4 in key emerging markets such as China, Brazil"
2071,"Our solid Consumer Beauty brand initiative pipeline for the first half of 2018 includes Clairol Colour Crave line of hair make-up, and COVERGIRL Total Tease Mascara, both of which are now hitting the shelves"
2072,"And while the brand relaunch for COVERGIRL will not fully begin until winter 2018, our project PDA campaign offers a glimpse of the new COVERGIRL positioning centered on confidence and empowerment"
2073,The campaign’s digital engagement results significantly exceeded our expectations with 6.4 million video views and 375 million impressions in the first two weeks from launch and somewhat lift in our new market performance for the brand
2074,"Shifting to Digital, I would like to share some of the continuous successes we are having both on our Digital Communication and e-commerce expansion"
2075,"As I discussed earlier, in Consumer Beauty, we saw strong digital engagement in connection with COVERGIRL PDA campaign, which in turn benefited the brand in market performance"
2076,"In Luxury, the Marc Jacobs Daisy Anniversary digital campaign reached 2.8 million young women with engagement rates in the mid-teens percentage in high target cost per view"
2077,The recent launch of MIU MIU L'eau Bleue via Digital-only campaign featured the Shoppable Instagram Story resulting in orders more than doubling on Sephora
2078,com
2079,"On the M&A front, the combined impact of the Hypermarcas Brands, ghd and Younique now represents a material addition to Coty’s results and I am pleased with the contribution of these businesses"
2080,"Speaking about Younique, I am happy to report that it continues to outperform in both net revenues and recruitment of active presenters"
2081,"Also, we are prepared and looking forward to welcoming the Burberry license in October"
2082,"The recent improvement in top-line trends is an early confirmation that our strategy to strengthen and grow our key brands, stabilize the remaining brands and expand our geographic footprint is beginning to yield results"
2083,"From a profit point of view, we still have work to do and it’s key priority for us"
2084,"In summary, we are proud of the progress that we have made in 2017, a challenging transitional year, but one that we believe has set the stage for Coty to be a global leader and challenger in Beauty"
2085,I will now turn it over to Patrice
2086,"No, I think what we have already pointed out is the fact that when it comes to synergies, the synergies is mainly weighted in the first on the second half of the year which will as a result of that impact the first half of year profitability"
2087,Now the measures that we are currently taking will yield some results sequentially in the coming quarters
2088,"So, first, I think it’s important to remind that, when we comment on the lower profitability in Q4, what we said is that it’s the result of two things"
2089,"First, a material improvement – increase, sorry, in the specimen in order to support the few momentum that we have in very few brands"
2090,So that’s the first one
2091,"The second one is indeed is a higher fixed cost base and as we said, this is first the reflection of our new divisional structure"
2092,"Second the fact that we had limited visibility with the TSA exit and now that we are wrapping things up and exiting the TSA in North America, in Europe and then in EMEA will have everything under our belt and we’ll be able to address these costs very rapidly"
2093,"So once again, we will come back in the coming quarters with some specific answers"
2094,We remain committed on our synergies of $750 million and on the phasing that we have outlined before
2095,"So, whenever I comment on specific guidance, we expect clearly to see momentum in the Luxury and Professional Beauty to continue and regarding Consumer Beauty, this is a more of a longer term as we discussed it’s a journey, and – but we are on the right path"
2096,"We are really working on the relaunch of several brands or most brands in Consumer Beauty, already discussed this in the past"
2097,"We are receiving very strong positive feedback from the retailer on all of the relaunches and so, we expect the overall momentum to continue for the two divisions, but we are not going to give you guidance for the overall company"
2098,We believe that we have the right level of investments behind our brands in our 2018 plan
2099,"What you have seen in Q4 is clearly material increase in the investments because we have certain launches that we believe are very important for us and they are going to yield some results and this is why you’ve see material increase behind launches like Hugo Boss Tonic, but also the preparation of Gucci Bloom and the Tiffany new fragrances we just launched but also the launch of the CK Obsessed and a couple of launches or campaigns in Consumer Beauty like the COVERGIRL PDA campaign or the Clairol Colour Crave launch"
2100,Early reaction on the GUCCI Bloom has been very favorable among consumers and retail partners
2101,We had the prelaunch in house in the month of August and the results are actually very promising
2102,They are above our expectations and the same is for the Tiffany launch we just did in Bloomingdale again it’s exclusive in the month of August and the results are actually very promising
2103,"They are above our expectations and the same is for the Tiffany launch which did in Bloomingdale, again it’s exclusive in the month of August and is also overachieving versus our expectations"
2104,"So, regarding some of the launches or relaunches, I believe you have asked your question about Consumer Beauty, am I right?"
2105,Okay
2106,"So, the plan to relaunch COVERGIRL is in the second half of fiscal 2018 and this as we discussed last time includes new positioning, new creative, new packaging and new store appearance"
2107,"And as I said, the retailer feedback on our plan has been very positive so far"
2108,"We’ve been working also with a new creative agency Droga5, which is one of the best agency in the world to build on an already strong brand equity"
2109,"Recently, we have seen a research coming from the outside from an external market research company which highlighted that actually COVERGIRL is the number one cosmetic brand in the U.S"
2110,"with the most loyal consumer base, especially amongst millennial"
2111,"So, clearly, when we see this, this was not done by us"
2112,This research gives us quite a lot of confidence about the relaunch that we are preparing
2113,"And we have done a campaign called Project PDA, Public Display of Application which actually received a lot of positive feedback from consumers but also retailers"
2114,"And again, it’s all around empowerment of women and the ability of self-distraction because we encourage women to actually apply make-up in public, which is quite a strong stand that we have taken with COVERGIRL and we are fully behind this"
2115,The new launch of COVERGIRL Total Tease Mascara has been a great success in Canada and is being now rollout in the U.S
2116,"but as I said, it’s going to be a gradual improvement over the performance because the fuller launch will have some four COVERGIRL in the second half of 2018. When I look at some of the other brands, we are also working quite hard on the relaunch of Clairol and we have quite a big initiatives coming again in the second half of 2018. We need to remember that also that most of the U.S"
2117,retailers today have their shelf reset in the second half of 2018 or beginning of calendar 2018 and so it’s important that all our plans will be all perfectly set and in tune with the trade windows that are prepared by the retailers
2118,"But also quite confident on Clairol and in the mean time, while we prepare for the full launch with this big innovation, we have launched Color Crave which is the line-up of the hair make-up which again goes into the direction of transforming Clairol from a very functional brand into a beauty brand which is one of the key objectives that we have for the brand in the future"
2119,"Color Crave started quite well although we are part of the beginning, so it’s still early results"
2120,"And above and beyond these two brands, we are also working on other relaunches in Sally Hansen is another brand that we are working on it for 2018 and in the mean time, I can tell you that the launch of Color Therapy in Sally Hansen is already 5%, 6% of market share of the nail market, plus we are focusing again on developing collections for the Sally Hansen brand"
2121,"Again, in the attempt of ensuring that this category which is more of an impulse category gets fueled by new innovation and new ideas on a regular basis for our consumers and our retailers"
2122,"On your second part of your question about $1.53 by 2020, so we expect to achieve these through the use of different levers including one, the achievement of our targeted synergies and ongoing efficiency initiatives"
2123,"So on our targeted synergies, I’ll remind you that the phasing that we have was 20% this year, 50% in fiscal 2018, 80% in fiscal 2019 and then the full 100% by 2020. So that gives you the hints on the phasing and of course, by the growth program and you see already that out of our three leg start we’ll have some growth momentum and of course, the strategic use of our balance sheet for M&A and you start to see that our recent acquisition Hypermarcas, ghd, Younique start to have a material impact on our growth profile which is in line with our overall synergy"
2124,The synergies are really net of any potential reinvestment et cetera
2125,"So what we mentioned is that we are going to generate the $750 million and as part of our investment thesis, this $750 million would come line in order to achieve the $1.53 of EPS"
2126,"So, this is net of any reinvestment and the support that would need to fuel the growth momentum"
2127,"And so, once again…"
2128,The impact of the P&L the $750 million is 20% this year
2129,"Then you have 50% that will be achieved in fiscal 2018 impacting the P&L in fiscal 2018, 80% impacting the P&L in fiscal 2019 and then the full $750 million impacting the P&L in fiscal 2020."
2130,20% of $750 million
2131,"Sure, sure, but we still – we start to see some growth momentum in two out of our three legs and this is going to continue to progress in the coming years, point one"
2132,"Point two, you also have a material impact of the acquisition that we have made, ghd, Hypermarcas and Younique which are growing quite substantially and as a result of that, we’ll weight even more on our growth profile going forward"
2133,"Yes, I believe that’s the right benchmark because of the way the composition of our portfolio both from a brand point of view, channels point of view and markets point of view"
2134,So I confirm what Part said in the roadshow
2135,"In terms of sales expectation, as we said, the primary program will not be a straight-line wavered over the last couple of quarters we have now reported gradual improvements in our underlying net revenue trends before we had high single-digit decline in the first half"
2136,Now are in low to mid-single-digits of decline in the second half
2137,We had two divisions which are confirming a strong positive momentum
2138,"And overall, what I can tell is that, we expect that strategic efforts that we are taking to continue to bear fruit in fiscal 2018."
2139,I will start with your second question
2140,"So, in terms of balance of e-commerce and work on retailers, what I can tell you is that, we are working quite hard on rebalancing our in-store execution"
2141,This is one of our key pillar of growth of our strategy
2142,"And so, we are making choices of shifting money to investment at the stores and of course, we are working with our key partners retailers to improve the partnership to bring more value to them and of course to step up the Omni channel"
2143,"And of course we are working on the relaunches of the brand which will hit the store in second half of 2018. Now that said, e-commerce is a big priority for us and I have already mentioned an announced a new structure with a new head of e-commerce, a new structure which has higher accountability on that"
2144,"It’s important to say that our agency, Beamly which we acquired around one-and-a-half year ago, is now fully focused on helping us on the e-commerce efforts"
2145,And we are working with the key customers also on stepping up the e-tailing business
2146,"So the e-retailer business, which is clearly some, a channel that can react much fast as well our program is"
2147,We are seeing good results there
2148,"And let’s also not forget that Younique, the business that we bought just recently in February is full e-commerce business, 100% B2C where we have over 250,000 brand ambassadors, presenters, who every day are out there selling cosmetics under the Younique brand via the web, via the social media"
2149,"So that’s – it’s a clear testament also to our new focus on e-commerce which is not done only through the acquisition of Younique, but also internally organically and the team is making big progress on this area"
2150,"Now, your first question was about Luxury and Professional Beauty offsetting the Consumer Beauty pressure"
2151,"What I can tell you is that, of course, we expect the momentum on Luxury and Professional Beauty to continue in 2018 and on Consumer Beauty, what I can tell you is, that the shelf space that have impacted us in 2017 truly only now in a certain ways having an impact, because the shelf reset from the key retailers it does happen around the March, April of each year, let’s say"
2152,"So, we expect these headwinds on shelf space losses to actually lapse and continue until Q3 before 2018 when we start to lapse the current shelf space losses"
2153,"Now, what’s happening is really the moment we are working with the retailers and presenting all our plans to ensure that we don’t see any more impact, let’s say post the new resets that will happen at the beginning of calendar 2018 - in the second half of fiscal 2018 and I have strong confidence that we will not see any more impact because of the great conversation we are having with the retailers and the positive feedback on our plans"
2154,"No doubt that our strategy has a channel mix and Specialty Beauty which you are alluding to, your mentioning is clearly a very important part of our channel mix"
2155,"So we are focusing on that quite a lot and the e-commerce, what I discussed before, so working with our partner retailers and working on the e-tailing business, the e-retailing business is also a big focus"
2156,It’s no doubt that consumers are shifting and their behavior and it’s also important that we do deploy strategy that are also in line with this shifting consumer behavior
2157,"So, absolutely working with the brick and mortar retailers, specialty, beauty and e-commerce, truly the three key areas of focus for all the relaunches that I mentioned before"
2158,"So, I would like to thank all of you for the attention and for the questions and I wish you a great day"
2159,"Thanks, Brian"
2160,"Good morning everyone, happy holidays"
2161,Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call
2162,We delivered strong results in Q2 and remain squarely on track with our transformation plan
2163,Strategically our top priority this year is strengthening top line performance behind modernized brands and a strong innovation slate
2164,"Two quarters in, we like what we see, our top line return to organic growth in the second quarter, ahead of schedule"
2165,"After a fast start to the year, we were in a position to add incremental support behind our brands in Q2 to enhance distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial"
2166,Most of these investments were above the net sales line and consistent with our strategy to reacquaint our consumer base with our modernized brands
2167,"However, we again experienced elevated inflation, including increased costs as a result of the recent hurricanes"
2168,"The net result in Q2 was that, despite pricing ahead of our categories, gross margins were pressured by the convergence of higher startup costs to support our brands and elevated inflation"
2169,"Importantly, we remain confident in our long-term margin expansion opportunity and our ability to deliver on the 2020 outlook we provided at our investor day last year"
2170,We continue to be active with our M&A agenda to bolster our strong positions in the important Snacks and Frozen categories
2171,"During the quarter, we completed our $250 million acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, the maker of Angie's Boom Chicka Pop, the fastest growing national read-to-eat popcorn brand in the U.S"
2172,", and as you saw earlier today, we announced an agreement to acquire Sandwich Bros"
2173,", which I will elaborate on in a few minutes"
2174,We also continue to deliver on our target to repurchase $1.1 billion of shares during fiscal 2018. We repurchased approximately $280 million of common stock during the second quarter
2175,"The bottom line is we're encouraged about our year-to-date performance, and we're updating our 2018 guidance to reflect organic net sales and adjusted EPS to be near the high end of their respective guidance ranges"
2176,"During the quarter, we marked our one-year anniversary as a branded pure play CPG company"
2177,And compared to where we were just three years ago the transformation has been quite remarkable
2178,"Between exiting private brands, successfully spinning off Lamb Weston as a thriving public company, and remaking our core business and culture into a more energized competitive unit, we have been and we will continue to be relentlessly focused on value creation"
2179,"It's been heavy lifting unwinding decades of engrained behaviors, but we like where we are, and we're confident in our future"
2180,Most of you are familiar with the expected cadence of our transformation plan shown on slide seven
2181,I'm happy to say that we remain squarely on track with these expectations
2182,Fiscal 2016 and 2017 were indeed a heavy lift as we put in the work to thoughtfully and methodically upgrade our revenue base and reset the top line by cutting back on excessive deep discount promotions and rationalizing a long tail of low-performing skews
2183,We also focused on improving efficiencies to build a strong foundation on the bottom line and expand margins
2184,"But as we've said all along, we can't cut our way to prosperity; we must grow the top line"
2185,"And we will do it the right way, by investing in renovation and innovation to achieve sustainable growth over the long-term"
2186,As we entered fiscal 2018 we were working from a much stronger revenue base
2187,"We have a healthier, less promotional business in U.S"
2188,retail
2189,"And our focus is now on improving brand saliency, which means reacquainting consumers with our modernized brands, and making them top-of-mind again"
2190,"Accordingly, we're making investments in innovation and renovation to enhance distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial to drive top line growth"
2191,And top line growth is exactly what we've achieved
2192,"On slide eight, you can see organic net sales grew 2.3% in the quarter"
2193,Strong volume performance particularly in our U.S
2194,retail businesses drove this result
2195,"Further, we estimate that even after adjusting for the positive impact of the recent hurricanes we delivered slight organic net sales growth in the second quarter"
2196,We estimate an approximately 220 basis point benefit related to hurricanes during the quarter
2197,"Our Food Service segment saw a one-time benefit from the hurricanes, and our Grocery and Snacks segment benefited from some customer warehouse and consumer pantry stocking"
2198,But the underlying strength of our core business is an encouraging affirmation of our plan and aggressive actions to jumpstart the top line
2199,"Make no mistake, we have much more to do, but we're making great progress in bending the sales trend and we're doing it the right way"
2200,The data on slide nine speaks to the quality of our growth
2201,"Our distribution performance shown here as TPDs, or total points of distribution is continuing to improve, we expect this trend to move upward in the back half supported by net gains as the pruning of low-performing skews abates and innovation continues to roll out"
2202,"Importantly, we have continued to increase sales velocity as we upgraded the quality of our TPDs"
2203,When we modernize our product and discontinue to weak skews we recondition consumers to purchase updated products off the shelf at full margin and the velocities are getting better every time we look at the data
2204,"As our base sales velocities improve our dollar sales have followed, turning positive in the second quarter"
2205,"As you can see on slide 10, these trends have allowed us to continue to price above our categories on average"
2206,We have also remained true to our value-over-volume strategy as the present sold on promotion has decreased every quarter for more than two years
2207,"While that trend is not sustainable in perpetuity, this clearly indicates that our strong volume performance was not driven by deep discounts or price rollbacks"
2208,We remain squarely focused on improving our base sales and reducing our reliance on inefficient trade promotion
2209,"Turning to slide 11, we remain on track to deliver against our 2020 margin goals"
2210,In the early innings of our transformation plan we got a fast start on margin improvement as we began to implement our value-over-volume strategy
2211,"But as we've always said, the path forward will not always be linear"
2212,Our margin improvement will not be a straight line particularly as we make the necessary investments to support innovation and drive trial and distribution across our brands
2213,"Margins may also move around quarter-to-quarter as we confront dynamics, like inflation, exiting lower margin businesses, and enhancing our portfolio with margin accretive acquisitions"
2214,"As I said at our inaugural investor day, when you take on a transformation of this magnitude there will be quarterly volatility in gross margin from time to time"
2215,"But regardless of short-term dynamics, we will move the centerline of our profitability north over time"
2216,"As I noted earlier, there were a few near-term factors impacting our gross margin performance"
2217,Better than expected top line performance through Q2 is enabling us to invest more in our U.S
2218,"retail business and add incremental support to further enhance the distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial of our brands, especially where we have new renovation and innovation"
2219,"As I mentioned earlier, this is consistent with our strategy to increase brand saliency with consumers"
2220,"This increased investment had a near-term impact on our overall price mix, which is reflected in our results this quarter"
2221,"Some of this will show up as slotting, and some of this will show up as priced given the structure of our joint business planning partnerships with customers this is not surprising"
2222,"Simply put, we are focused on strategic investments behind higher quality product presentation, and our investments will be brand and customer specific as we both reacquaint consumers with legacy brands and introduce new offerings to the market"
2223,We are strategically using trade as a catalyst for our modernized brands
2224,"This fuels new distribution, better shelf presentation, end-aisle display, and customer circular visibility to generate awareness of the new relevant benefits of our products"
2225,Dave will provide a bit more detail on the additional factors that impacted near-term gross margin performance shortly
2226,But the bottom line is that none of these factors change our long-term margin outlook or our commitment to chip away at the margin opportunity over time
2227,"Now turning to our segment performance on slide 12, you can see the continued growth in our Refrigerated and Frozen segment, which was aided this quarter by innovation launched under the Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice, and Banquet trademarks"
2228,"In addition, the Frontera brand introduced frozen mean innovation, and we also saw continued growth in the core Reddi-wip business"
2229,"On slide 13, you can see scanner data that highlights the acceleration in this segment"
2230,"Looking at the chart on the left, you can see the top line improvement in our frozen single-serve meal business through the end of Q2, which we believe is the best proxy for the traction of our plan"
2231,"As you know, our recent brand renovation work focused on Frozen"
2232,"And within Frozen, we put significant effort toward renovating Banquet, the largest single-serve frozen meal brand by volume in the U.S"
2233,", after considerable effort to modernize the brand and recondition shoppers to purchase the products off shelf at full margin, Banquet returned to growth in the second quarter"
2234,"We're pleased to have this brand back on track, and are encouraged by the positive consumer response"
2235,We're also mindful of our expectation for the brand and its role in our portfolio as a reliable contributor
2236,"We do not expect Banquet to be a rapid grower growing forward, but it is a large important brand"
2237,"We're very pleased to have liberated it from a $1 retail price point, and to have improved both top and bottom line performance"
2238,"Overall, you can begin to get a sense for why we feel good about our growth algorithm both this year and for the long-term"
2239,One of the most compelling reasons for our optimism continues to be the success of our innovation slate which is building distribution and performing well in its early days in the market
2240,"We started rebuilding our innovation slate with a focus on our Frozen business, and you can expect to see us apply the same level of rigor and discipline across our portfolio where we see opportunity"
2241,"Turning to our Grocery and Snacks segment on slide 15, you can see that we're continuing to drive improvement"
2242,We estimate organic sales were roughly flat for the quarter after adjusting for the hurricanes
2243,"That's a significant improvement over Q1. Our Q2 Grocery and Snacks reported sales reflect approximately 200 basis points of positive impact related to the hurricanes, which drove customer warehouse and consumer pantry stocking behavior"
2244,"While this was a benefit in Q2, we expect the shift to negatively impact Q3 sales in this segment"
2245,"The improvement in the base business is encouraging, but it is still very early days"
2246,"We have a lot of work to do ahead to renovate certain brands and provide the appropriate investment support, similar to the work we've done with our Frozen portfolio"
2247,So let me take a step back and provide some perspective on how we think about this segment
2248,Clearly we see Snacks as an attractive growth opportunity
2249,"As a reminder, our snacks business includes strong brands such as Slim Jim, one of the leading players in mean snacks with increasing household penetration among millennials; Orville Redenbacher, the largest selling brand in microwave popcorn and the best selling brand of popcorn online; David Seeds, the leader in seeds with more than twice the share of the next largest competitor; Swiss Miss, which accounts for over half of the volume of hot cocoa sold in U.S"
2250,"retail, it's also the preferred choice of millennials by more than four times over the nearest competitor; and Act II which is growth both domestically and internationally"
2251,"We're also very pleased with the robust performance of recently added brands such as Duke's, Bigs, and Frontera"
2252,And we're quite excited about the opportunities presented by the acquisition of Angie's Boom Chicka Pop
2253,"So overall, snacks will be an extremely important area for us going forward, and we're just getting warmed up"
2254,We'll be sharing more about snacking renovation and innovation in the months to come
2255,"As we articulated at investor day, a simple way to think about our large grocery business is to break it into two groups; condiments and enhancers, and shelf stable meals and sides"
2256,We do that because generally speaking these groups will play different roles over time
2257,"With condiments and enhancers, such as Hunt's Tomatoes, Ro-Tel, Frontera Salsa, and Pam, we see on-trend brands that align with the needs of young millennial households which are starting to cook affordable by flavorful meals at home"
2258,"Accordingly, they will be a focus area for continued investment"
2259,"The role of shelf stable means and side dishes such as Chef Boyardee, Libby's, and La Choy is to be reliable contributors, providing steady cash flow to fund growth opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio"
2260,"That doesn't mean, we will neglect these brands to the contrary, we absolutely need to keep them fresh so they continue to reliably contribute"
2261,"Overall, we remain focused on our disciplined portfolio segmentation approach to apply the appropriate support for each brand"
2262,"So while it's early days, we're happy with our growth momentum and we're excited about the future"
2263,"Importantly, we're growing share and our categories are growing with our sharpened focus and enhanced capabilities we have reason to be excited about our future"
2264,"And before I wrap up, a few thoughts on M&A, as you can see on Slide 19, we have been highly active leveraging M&A to reshape our portfolio for better long-term growth and margins, clearly the inbound businesses have been smaller modernizing acquisitions versus larger more synergistic deals"
2265,You should not interpret that as a string of pearl strategy in lieu of more transformational deals
2266,"As I've said many times, we are always on the lookout for both modernizing and synergistic acquisitions the former tend to be more plentiful than the latter but we're always in a position of readiness should the right property and the reasonable valuation emerge"
2267,"Earlier today, we announced our planned acquisition of the Sandwich Bros"
2268,"business simply put this is a frozen capability play, handhelds offer great convenience to consumers and this business provides some terrific capabilities"
2269,"These are freshly prepared delicious sandwiches that are then flash frozen to be ready when you are, they play across breakfast, lunch and dinner"
2270,The business generated approximately $60 million in net sales over the past year and is growing rapidly
2271,"Once this deal is closed, we expect to see some exciting expansions of this on-trend format both under the Sandwich Bros"
2272,line and other ConAgra Brands
2273,"I'll wrap it up with Slide 21, in summary we're encouraged by our return to growth and the performance of our innovation"
2274,"We'll continue to support growth through disciplined and strategic investments to drive distribution, merchandising and trial"
2275,Executional excellence remains a key focus in everything that we do particularly as we move through an inflationary environment
2276,"As we just discussed, we'll stay active in our pursuit of value enhancing M&A and will be relentless about doing what's necessary to deliver our long-term algorithm"
2277,"Given our strong performance, we've updated our 2018 guidance to reflect organic net sales and adjusted EPS to be near the high end of their respective guidance ranges"
2278,"With that, I'll hand it over to Dave to share more on the details of the quarter"
2279,"Dave, over to you?"
2280,Morning
2281,"Yes, good morning, Andrew"
2282,"Yes, this is Sean"
2283,We will continue to invest above the line and below the line behind the brands in the second half
2284,When we got off to a strong start in the year it gave us the opportunity to do that as well as anticipating a tax reform
2285,"And the simple logic for that is with all the work we've done and put into building our innovation pipeline when we get our new innovations in the marketplace, particularly in stores at the point of purchase, it is critical that we build awareness around these new benefits and around the new modernized look of these products"
2286,"Internally we've got a phrase here a phrase here that we use that use called ""confidential innovation"""
2287,And what we mean by that is when we do all the work building out our innovation pipeline the last thing we want is to get it into the marketplace and have nobody see it
2288,If that would be the case we'd call that confidential innovation
2289,So we're trying to avoid that obviously
2290,"We're trying to create consumer awareness and let our package design and the food itself, the look of the food, the varieties, the modern flavors drive consumer pull"
2291,"And we're highly confident that because of the quality of the food we're putting into products this year, in particular in frozen meals, that we will get strong repeat"
2292,And the early data that we're seeing on that bodes well
2293,"So, as we look at the return on these startup investments over time we expect them to be quite strong, but strategically we view it as vital to getting the right kind of uptick particularly given we really took a last year or year-and-a-half off when it came to new innovation"
2294,"Yes, obviously M&A is an important part of our playbook going forward"
2295,And we've all seen high multiples in M&A in food in general for the last few years
2296,Snacks is the flavor this week
2297,We had condiments last quarter; we had other things before that
2298,So it's been a high multiple environment
2299,"And in that environment we try to strike the right balance between our desire to be aggressive with M&A to help reshape our portfolio for better growth and better margins, but also to be disciplined"
2300,"So we understand that there are higher multiples out there, but we still hold ourselves to pretty high standards in terms of being able to get an IRR on our deals that is above our weighted average to capital"
2301,So that's one of the ways we look at getting proper return on our M&A investments and we'll continue to strike the right balance between being aggressive and being disciplined going forward
2302,"Hi, Bryan"
2303,"Well, we have different brands across our portfolio"
2304,"The consumer domains that we've talked about before, we've got meals which tends to lean toward frozen, we've got enhancers, and we've got snacks"
2305,You're going to continue to see us do probably bolder innovation on the meals and snacks consumer domains
2306,And what you'll see more in the grocery part of the store and enhancers looks more like renovation
2307,So may not be as much on new slotting there
2308,Maybe things like updating the look of our products
2309,"Probably some skew varieties, but a bit of a different mix"
2310,"I think the bigger point here is that we look at marketing in total, meaning above-the-line marketing spend and below-the-line marketing spend"
2311,And when we use the phrase marketing behind our brands we're referring to investments that engage the consumer with our brands
2312,"And that could be everything from traditional TV and print ads, to distribution investments, to merchandizing, to sampling, to digital marketing, even customer loyalty programs"
2313,So you've got a wide array of activities here -- marketing activities that span above net sales and below net sales cost buckets
2314,"And as we move our activity mix it may toggle spend above the line and below the line, and we'll try to be transparent with you all around what those activities are and why we're doing them"
2315,"When we're on ramp-up mode on things that are quite materially different from how the brands looked in the past, think frozen so far this year with all the work we've done, we really focus our energy disproportionately on the in-store environment and centre store because that's where we get the biggest engagement with consumers around these meaningfully revitalized brands in that startup mode"
2316,And that's why we're doing what we're doing right now because we believe it's going to get us the best long-term top line performance and the best ultimate returns
2317,"Well, I think in the last few years growth has been on average more elusive for the industry"
2318,And when you see those cycles emerge where growth is more elusive you tend to hear more talk around consolidation and harvesting synergies
2319,But as a potential participant in some of those deals we want to focus on our shareholders and the return we get for our shareholders
2320,And obviously synergies are great
2321,But when you give away all your synergies in a deal to the seller it's not particularly useful to our shareholders
2322,So we're going to always keep our shareholders in mind as we think about portfolio changes that ultimately position us for long-term strength and value creation
2323,"Rob, let me tell you how I think about that"
2324,Let me start with the second half of your question first around trade investments
2325,I think it's a very simple mental model that a lot of investors have that when we talk trade we're talking putting that money right into deep discounting and deals
2326,Increasingly that is not really anywhere near the full story
2327,"It's more about joint business planning with customers around everything from merchandising, which usually has some level of discount to it, in our case nowhere near the depths that we had historically"
2328,But it also has to do with points of distribution
2329,It has to do with quality of shelf space and facings
2330,"Is it eyelevel or is it down in the well, the ability to sample products in store, the ability to target consumers on their apps that are customer-specific"
2331,"So trade and customer investment is much more holistic than just deep discounting deals, and features, and things that you've heard about historically"
2332,And certainly in our case that is true
2333,Keep in mind we've invested a fair amount in improving our trade efficiency capabilities
2334,"So we've now got post-event analytic tools, we've got trade planning management tools"
2335,"We are able to look at thousands upon thousands of trade events, find the ones that are low ROI, get rid of those, and find the ones that are positive ROI and do more of those because we get more bang for our buck"
2336,"Some of that is the structure of the merchandizing, some of it is timing"
2337,"So we are spending above the line, but it is what I would describe as a significantly higher quality investment in terms of engaging consumers in our brands than what it used to be at ConAgra, which was really about taking very outdated and old fashioned products and just moving them based on deep, deep discounting"
2338,"And as you saw in the slides, our promoted levels are down overall, and our pricing is up and above our categories"
2339,"Now with respect to pricing, just a couple of thoughts on pricing, as I pointed out before, we've built an integrated margin management team and improved our pricing capabilities dramatically versus what we had just a few years ago"
2340,And over the past few years we've taken more price than most
2341,And we think about pricing three ways
2342,"There's number one, inflation justified pricing; number two, trade efficiency, and I just talked a little bit about that; and three, premium-priced innovation which over time will be positive mix"
2343,So clearly pricing is complex when you pivot from deflation to inflation you want to price as fast as you can
2344,Sometimes there's a lag
2345,And sometimes if the inflation appears transitory on certain commodities and the forward curves drop back down retailers can be more reluctant to take price because they don't want constant shelf price volatility
2346,And then the last factor is that not every brand and every category are created equal in terms of elasticities of demand
2347,"So all of this is why we are principally committed to pricing when justified, but also why we focus on the center line of our profitability over time and not on quarterly volatility because there tends to be a fair amount of noise"
2348,"Yes, on innovation, Chris, we will continue to have innovation coming out in the back half of the year and we'll have startup support behind that"
2349,"Some of it with some customers shows up as slotting, some of it just goes into debt net"
2350,"But it is a diverse means of supporting the brands from actual physical distribution, as I mentioned, to quality of shelving, to in-store support"
2351,All of those things are the things that we're doing disproportionately
2352,"So what you saw in Q2 was some reduction of A&P that was then moved above the line, and then additional expense above the line in support of the brands in an in-store environment"
2353,"And one thing to keep in mind as well going forward, we talked about this a little bit last quarter is, we're coming off of a base period where we didn't really have a lot of, what I'll call, brand support in the base, startup support, innovation support because we pushed the pause button last year while we rebuilt the funnel"
2354,So as we get these investments into our base this year we won't see the magnitude of year-on-year changes going forward because we're getting back to more normal going innovation launch cadence
2355,"Yes, sure"
2356,"David, what you're referring to is a slide that we put up"
2357,"It wasn't technically part of our guidance, but it was kind of a true north for us on innovation that we'd like to march towards over time"
2358,It's something we called renewal rate which is the percentage of annual sales that come from prior three-year innovations
2359,And our point was that our company historically had been in the high single digits
2360,Companies that are doing well and best in class are closer to 15%
2361,So our aim over time is to really close that gap
2362,It's not as if we need to get to 15% on a straight line march from where we started
2363,"And by the way, it's also something -- it's not the kind of metric you're going to look at on a quarterly basis, you've got to settle it in"
2364,"But clearly, as you can imagine, with the slate of innovation that we've got hitting the marketplace now by the time we get to this year, we will see a pretty material uptick in that renewal rate"
2365,"Tom, you want to comment on what's coming in the back half?"
2366,"Just one other building on Tom's comments David one other thing that we're always thinking about which is we've got to wrap this year slate next year and it's not lost on us that we will be wrapping next year a big slate and as a result, you should assume that we've been very aggressive in making sure that our innovation slate for next year is going to be as impressive as this year"
2367,"I continue to talk about frozen and how I think we have years and years of runway on frozen, undoubtedly we're going to continue to have a big slate there, you'll hear us talk more about some of these things that CAG is coming up after the holidays but then snacking is a big area for us and some of the most innovative things we've got going on as a company are some of the acquisitions we've made"
2368,Duke's is clearly one of the most innovative brands in the very hot meat snack space and now with Angie's Boom Chicka Pop as the national leader of branded ready to eat popcorn that's if that's a business we can do a lot with going forward
2369,So you'll hear more about what comes next when we're at some invest meetings in the new calendar year
2370,"Yes, I think in our retail business, David, the dynamics we saw in the hurricane were very similar to the things that I've experienced throughout my long career in the world of food, which is when you have shelf stable goods that are either in meals or in snacks, you're tended to see a fair amount of stocking both warehouse stocking with customers and pantry stocking in and around the hurricanes"
2371,And in my experience there're almost always higher levels of stocking than there is immediate term consumption
2372,"So what we experienced, what we experienced last quarter to me was textbook with what I've experienced throughout my career"
2373,"There is one particular nuance that's worth mentioning, which is specific to Chef Boyardee, just to provide a little bit more color on this and that is that our quarter two Chef saw some pretty significant impact on Chef we had previously negotiated much higher impact merchandising events in quarter two this year than last year with those key events timed around back to school"
2374,"So in other words, we planned more trade support in the quarter"
2375,"As it turns out, those major events that we planned upfront just happened to coincide timing wise with the hurricanes and the effect this had was to move a ton of volume but at compressed gross margins"
2376,"So while inflation on his brand was up a good bit, the hurricane fueled sales spike came while the brand was on deal for back to school, so while we got far more takeaway than we originally expected, we also got a bit more margin compression on that business than we expected and higher absolute trade expenses and to your point as we mentioned earlier because a fair amount of that is sitting in could we believe is sitting in consumer pantries we expect to get some of that back in Q3 as consumers work through that inventory and that dynamic there is not different from what I've experienced before"
2377,"Yes, we are seeing it, but let me go back to what I said before on this, because I think it's a really important point and I think it's a different experience with ConAgra than maybe what you all see elsewhere in the industry which is on a lot of our brands we saw a retailer margin compression for years and the reason that happens because our brands were locked into very low price points usually a dollar or a $0.99 or a $1.99. So in other words, over decades ConAgra saw compressed margins and our retailer saw compressed margins and as you can imagine and I mention as before when we talked to retailers about our aggressive innovation slate, one of the reasons why they were very supportive of it and our goal to modernize brands was actually the opposite of what a lot of times we hear about, which is a desire to take prices lower in our case it was a desire to take prices higher"
2378,And as we did that build back in better retailer margins so case in point there is Healthy Choice Power Bowls
2379,We still have a small sliver of Healthy Choices that are these classic meals that are sold to older boomers that business has gotten smaller as we kind of sunset that piece of it but we are replacing it with higher margin
2380,"Higher dollar in businesses like Healthy Choice simply and now Healthy Choice Power Bowls, which are not only higher price points but better margin structure for our retailers"
2381,So we are participating and rebuilding retailer margins but in our case we're doing in the context of modernized brands with higher absolute price points and higher absolute food quality
2382,"On that latter piece, Jason, I'm not any more concerned this quarter than I've been previous quarters about private label as I've mentioned before"
2383,"Private label on average under indexes in our categories it's about a 70 index versus food on average and in key strategic categories like frozen it's significantly lower than that so I'm not anticipating any change, it's not built into our planning posture in terms of private label interaction getting to be more of a headwind"
2384,"With respect to investing behind our business in trade but I wouldn't over think this is a simple way to think about it is we were in launch mode in the front half of this year and we knew, we have we want to support our brand because we're trying to build future cash flows here by reestablishing consumer loyalty and household penetration on our brands and when we saw the early traction on the business when we saw we got up to a fast start of the year and fueled in part by a high degree of confidence, we're going to get a tax return"
2385,"We made the strategic decision to put more money behind our businesses because we had confidence in our brands and in our innovation and by and large we got the response that we were looking for and that's bit of a higher level of support as we continue to launch stuff through the back half of the year and then next year we will wrap some of these levels investments will be baked into our core, so I wouldn't anticipate another step up as we move into the out years I think we're going to kind of get it in our base here as we proceed"
2386,"But at the end of the day the fact that we've got traction on these brands and our investments are working in terms of driving consumer trial, and we have confidence in the products themselves to drive repeat"
2387,This is all part of a positive flywheel in our view
2388,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast"
2389,"In the third quarter, I'm pleased with our performance"
2390,"We delivered growth, both in net sales and EPS, in a volatile environment"
2391,"We continue to feel good about our CMG and snack strategy, as most segments within the $100 billion U.S"
2392,snack wheel remained strong and continue to outpace center of the plate trends
2393,"As planned, constant currency net sales increased 1.1% in the third quarter"
2394,"And EPS of $1.33, increased 3% versus last year"
2395,"There was no change to our constant currency full year net sales outlook, and we reaffirmed full year EPS growth at the high-end of our 7% to 9% range"
2396,"As discussed previously, embedded in our outlook are important marketplace investments in the business that will benefit the company over the near and long-term, as well as some new challenges, such as higher freight and distribution, that emerged in the course of the quarter"
2397,"Patricia will have further details, but some of these, particularly the supply chain costs, pressured Q3 operating profit and are expected to continue in Q4. We believe investments in our strategic initiatives will enable the business to deliver long-term sales growth, gross margin expansion and operating profit growth, or a virtuous cycle, over our strategic planning cycle"
2398,"Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 3.7% in Q3. Advertising expense was up 10%, partially offset by lower consumer promotions"
2399,"There is no change to our full year North America advertising and related consumer marketing outlook, although International and Other segment advertising and related consumer marketing is estimated to be lower in 2017 versus 2016, resulting in total Hershey Company spend that will be about the same as last year"
2400,"Now, let me turn to our measured channel retail performance"
2401,"But before I do, I want to note that this summer, we selected IRI as our preferred market insights and analytics provider"
2402,"IRI has made significant investments in capabilities and technology platforms, and we believe they are a good partner for Hershey"
2403,"IRI's platform will help us target the right consumers, in the right channels, at the right moment"
2404,Total Hershey Q3 U.S
2405,"retail takeaway growth was 1%, driven by CMG growth of 1.4%"
2406,"This more than offsets some softness in grocery items, such as baking chips and syrup"
2407,"Looking at CMG, or candy, mint and gum, the category and Hershey continue to outpace center of the store edibles"
2408,"For the 12-week and year-to-date period ending October 8, CMG category growth was plus 2.4% and plus 1.7%, respectively"
2409,Hershey Q3 and year-to-date CMG retail takeaway was plus 1.4% and plus 2%
2410,"Our year-to-date CMG market share is up plus 0.1 points, driven by strong innovation and in-store activity in the first half of the year"
2411,"Importantly, within the combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy segment, where we derive the majority of our U.S"
2412,"sales, Q3 category growth is about 3.3%"
2413,"Our core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth, and I'm particularly pleased with their marketplace performance"
2414,The combined retail takeaway on these brands in Q3 increased about 5%
2415,"As we've discussed in prior quarters, this was partially offset by planned decline on select chocolate and non-chocolate candy brands as we focus on reducing complexity and improving overall velocity rates at retail"
2416,"Therefore, the increase of Hershey's Q3 combined chocolate and non-chocolate candy retail takeaway of plus 1.1% resulted in market share being slightly off"
2417,We are working on plans to improve the performance of our non-core candy brands and look forward to sharing this with you in the near future
2418,Hershey's CMG and snacks innovation had another good quarter
2419,"It's my goal to ensure that on an annual basis, this strategic lever is a lever that consistently delivers meaningful, sustainable CMG and snacks growth"
2420,We continue to anticipate strong innovation as a contributor to achieve our long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%
2421,"Specifically, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, is tracking as expected"
2422,"We achieved our distribution target earlier in the year and maintain this level, given the repeat velocity at retail"
2423,"CLC has been strongly supported by advertising throughout the year on TV, social and online, with continuity media planned through the rest of the year"
2424,"As we look to 2018, we'll continue to invest in this product with the launch of Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate"
2425,Shipments to select customers begin near the end of the year
2426,"Importantly, the Cookie Layer Crunch platform is Hershey's largest launch in recent history and will receive equal support in year two as it did in year one"
2427,The transition from lay down bags to stand-up pouches on our core chocolate packaged candy products is progressing
2428,"In the fourth quarter, we'll introduce new retail-ready packaging at select retailers before a broader rollout next year"
2429,"This initiative enables product to get on the shelf quicker, with less in-store labor and it improves shopability in the aisle"
2430,"Both of these packaging initiatives have an impact on gross margin in Q4 and most likely in the first half of 2018, but we believe this is the right long-term investment for our brands and business, as it should result in improved shelf presence and visibility"
2431,"In Q3, we also made good progress against our snacks platform"
2432,"We expanded our initial Snack Mix and Snack Bites products with the launch of Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels, primarily in large format take-home bags"
2433,"While early, results are encouraging"
2434,Net sales growth is ahead of plan and consumer reaction is positive when our brands are merchandised in the snacks aisle
2435,"The velocity of the Popped Snack Mix items is in line with similar competing products, while the Hershey-branded Chocolate Dipped Pretzels is outpacing competition"
2436,So we feel good about the progress we're making
2437,"Our power chocolate brands are growing and gaining share, and we're working on plans that should enable other parts of our CMG and snacks portfolio to see gains in the near future"
2438,"As I discussed in July, e-commerce is another strategic initiative that we are focusing on"
2439,"We continue to work with key brick-and-mortar retailers related to their click-and-collect and omni-channel initiatives, as well as with established e-commerce players"
2440,"As a result, our year-to-date U.S"
2441,e-commerce sales are up about 40%
2442,We have a dedicated and growing cross-functional team responsible for the strategies and execution of our e-commerce plan in developing the next generation of online impulse solutions
2443,We're working with all the key strategic partners and will be validating and testing concepts in Q4 and 2018 that we believe will lead to a sustainable business model
2444,Given our strong CMG position in the U.S
2445,", we are collaboratively working with our partners to develop e-commerce-friendly portfolios, digital shelf upgrades, and alternative fulfillment solutions"
2446,"And in September, we went live with a customer on the first-ever omni-channel Halloween program"
2447,"Initial results are exceeding expectations, and I'm very excited about the potential for our business in this space"
2448,"Now, for an update on our International and Other segment, excluding China, our International and Other segment constant currency net sales are expected to increase this year"
2449,"Net sales for the quarter were relatively in line with our estimate, and on a constant currency basis, about the same as the third quarter of 2016. We're making measured investments in our core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where we're seeing solid marketplace gains"
2450,"Combined constant currency net sales growth in these markets was 8%, and we're improving on operating income trends at the same time"
2451,"In China, we're executing against the Margin for Growth program as we discussed on March 1. This efficiency and effectiveness initiative is progressive nicely and on track"
2452,"We're optimizing our in-country supply chain and streamlining the operating model, as we strike the right balance between in-country investments and near-term market opportunities"
2453,"As expected, due to summer seasonality, the China chocolate category declined by about minus 1% and is roughly flat year-to-date"
2454,"Small format stores continued to show growth, outpacing the marketplace performance in hypermarkets"
2455,"Going forward, we have a measured and disciplined strategy in China that is focused on the Hershey brand's messaging, continued e-commerce penetration, and smaller store format expansion"
2456,So I'm pleased with our progress in this segment
2457,And I expect our focus on profitable growth to result in break-even or better operating results this year
2458,"Now to wrap up, confections is one of the largest segments within the $100 billion U.S"
2459,"snack market, and we are confident that our brands and consumer-centric business model position us well to deliver sustained top and bottom-line growth over the long-term"
2460,"I'm encouraged that the broader snacks category continues to grow, despite the volatile consumer and retail environment"
2461,Our strong U.S
2462,marketplace presence and solid financial position gives us the flexibility to smartly invest in confectionery and other snacks as well as in the capabilities that give us a competitive edge at retail and with consumers
2463,"We're committed to our marketing mix modeling, trade, TV advertising, and digital media and investments related to innovation, consumer marketing and insights"
2464,This is part of our DNA and why I remain so optimistic about Hershey and the opportunities that lie ahead of us
2465,"As we look to 2018, it's too early to talk about details; however, we feel good about our preliminary plans"
2466,"We believe we have the right level of core brand activity, innovation, and programming lined up that will continue to drive category growth, despite a shorter Easter"
2467,Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate and upcoming Reese's innovation will bring variety and news to the category
2468,"And I'm also excited with the introduction of Hershey's Gold, Hershey's fourth flavor"
2469,Hershey's Gold features a rich cream that delivers a buttery sweet flavor and a distinctively new Hershey's experience
2470,"Its caramelize cream also includes a combination of salty crunchy bits of peanuts and pretzels that deliver a creamy, crunchy satisfaction"
2471,"The instant consumable pack type will begin to ship to only a few select customers in Q4, but you'll see it in stores more broadly in January, as merchandising and program will be tied with the Winter Olympics, which begin on February 9. We're a growth and EBIT margin-focused company with a goal of increasing margins over the long-term via both cost control and, importantly, top-line growth"
2472,"I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results"
2473,"Thanks, Patricia"
2474,I just want to start by thanking all of our employees for those solid Q3 results that we delivered
2475,"As you've heard me say before, in an environment of accelerating change, I see opportunity"
2476,And I'm optimistic about our future
2477,We are focused on what we need to do to succeed
2478,Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong
2479,Our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that we'll continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders
2480,So thank you
2481,"And now, we will open it up for any questions that you may have"
2482,Question-and-Answer Session
2483,Good morning
2484,"So let me talk a little bit broadly, and I'll also talk about Hershey in particular"
2485,"So first of all, yeah, customer service rates are critically important to our customers in the marketplace right now"
2486,"And I think, certainly, as there is a pressured consumer retail environment, we all want to capture every sale that we possibly can"
2487,"So, as a result of that, we believe it was a strategically-good decision for us to really focus and up our performance on customer fill even higher, even if it meant some additional investments in moving product around a bit more"
2488,So I would say that that is an overall theme in the industry between retailers and manufacturers that we are all jointly working on together
2489,"I'll also tell you, if I speak to Hershey specifically, there are a couple pressures that we had"
2490,"So you can see the strong growth that we have in our core brands and have continued to have all year long, has actually put pressure on activity (30:14) across our system"
2491,And we have made decisions to move product around a bit more to make sure we don't lose any of those sales as we invest in manufacturing capacity to expand our capabilities on those brands
2492,Some of the innovation that we've had on our business as well has necessitated a few more touches and a few more additional shipments that drove some cost for us
2493,"Some of the multi-component products like Snack Mix, for example, where you're moving multiple ingredients to make the products"
2494,"And then also some of our packaging initiatives that we believe are critically important in the marketplace, which, on a temporary basis, create some additional inventory across the system"
2495,"And then I think you're aware, you've probably heard others talk about that, going forward, there are some additional pressures just across freight, given tightening capacity in the short-term"
2496,There were some weather-related issues
2497,"And over the longer-term, I think there are some trucking-related, trucker availability issues and capacity that are emerging and starting to impact, as well as some new regulatory changes that we believe is going to create pressure on the availability of truckers as well"
2498,"I mean, certainly, we've seen that the C-store retail community has talked about some of the pressures that they felt in their stores and trips not being where they would like them to be"
2499,So we certainly sell a lot of instant consumables there
2500,So we are always anxious to have strong trips into that environment
2501,"So certainly, that has an impact"
2502,I would say there's a few other places where we're expanding the portfolio across snacking that also have a lower margin than our core items
2503,"And certainly things like Snack Mix, which I think have very viable and successful in the marketplace, create a little pressure on mix as well"
2504,"Patricia, do you want to talk about that a little bit?"
2505,"Hi, David"
2506,"So, David, we continue to expect that at the end of the year, our inventory and our retail takeaway will be aligned"
2507,Third quarter has been a little bit of a messy quarter relative to all those weather impacts that occurred
2508,"And actually, even being able to get the available data from a Nielsen or an IRI to really feel confident, given some of the stores that have been closed down, et cetera, and then also with seasons"
2509,So I think the best way to think about it is that we anticipate them to be fully aligned by the end of the year
2510,"Yeah, David"
2511,"If you look at our full year plan, our plan was a bit more front-loaded"
2512,"And particularly, if you looked at C-store, we are lapping an unusually strong period year ago on instant consumable innovation when we had the Kit Kat Big Kat and as well as the Reese's Pieces Cup"
2513,And so the category was looking good in third quarter
2514,"And we have a tough lap, though, particularly because of the year-ago innovation in instant consumable and that's the biggest thing impacting us"
2515,You're welcome
2516,"Hi, Andrew"
2517,"No, absolutely"
2518,"So if you think about our total portfolio, if you think about the baking piece of the portfolio, chips and syrup, I think, saw some of the similar trends that we've seen with other center of store categories, so some pressure there"
2519,"We spoke earlier this year relative to us having a focus to right-size our snacking portfolio and really focus more in a precision approach, so some of that right-sizing"
2520,"And then, as it comes to what we call our variety chocolate brands and sweets, we've been working on optimizing our consumer communication and investments there to stabilize and get some growth out of those brands"
2521,You're welcome
2522,Yeah
2523,So we remain committed to our strategy of being an innovative snacking powerhouse and really a focus on capturing more snacking occasions and appealing to new users within snacking
2524,"And, yes, I think we're continuing to execute against the strategies that we've laid out relative to innovation, leveraging our core brands in areas like Snack Mix, which we're really pleased with the results; barkTHINS, which is up, I think, 50% this year, which has also been a nice addition"
2525,"And as we look at our priorities overall, we've always stated that M&A is a key piece of that"
2526,And you've seen us execute against that over the past couple years
2527,So I would expect that that would continue to be a piece of how we look to deliver that expansion
2528,"I was going to say, I think it might just be hard to look at total distribution points because there is so much noise in those distribution points"
2529,"So we've had an active SKU rationalization program where we are eliminating merchandising SKUs, many smaller things"
2530,"At the same time, we have our stand-up packaging initiative in the marketplace, which put new SKUs in place, which we think are very productive SKUs"
2531,"And so there's a little bit – both of those things going on at the same time that I think is getting muted in the total numbers, too"
2532,So I think that we always see retailers really try and leverage seasons as a destination to bring consumers into their store environments
2533,"And I think that this year is no different, from that perspective"
2534,"I would say, I would remind you that we have continued to see over the past several years a lot of compression around the holidays"
2535,"So with Halloween being on Tuesday, it's hard to get a total feel for what the season will shake out like"
2536,"But I think that overall merchandising, we're seeing very strong collaboration with retailers, as we have in the past"
2537,So I can't say we've seen a really big change there
2538,I think we see the retailer continuing to use the seasons as they have
2539,Good morning
2540,"You know, we have had a continuous focus, as we've talked to you before, about building strategic revenue management capabilities"
2541,Our big focus has continuously been being even more effective and efficient with our promotional dollars
2542,"And so, I think the movement that you would see in the marketplace, at least from us, would be around us really trying to get tighter about the best promotional programs and price points that maximize driving top-line, but at the most profitable levels, so that we're not getting ineffective deflation, but we're using price to maximize revenue"
2543,And I think that continues to be a focus for us
2544,"Certainly, I think in a pressured environment, some elements of the market are looking at whether price can bring in more consumers"
2545,"But I think that everybody's also looking at that in a very balanced way, which is unless price is really driving incrementality, then it's deflation that has no benefit"
2546,"So, I think that's what we're really seeing in the marketplace"
2547,"And our focus, clearly, is on making every dollar count, getting smarter about what really drives the performance"
2548,"So as we look at our broad snacking strategy, clearly, the goal of expanding occasions is to drive incremental purchase and to source more broadly across that snacking wheel"
2549,"And, yes, I would say we do do research and analytics to try and understand how we can best develop propositions that will add incrementally to our portfolio"
2550,So that's definitely a key area of focus for us
2551,"So I think where we are gaining some placement, it is an area that's more fragmented"
2552,"And certainly, one approach that we're trying to do is to leverage the strengths that we've built over the years around category management to help the retailers to make that section as productive as possible to bring some of the great innovation that we've been known for in the confection category and provide news and exciting propositions in that segment to generate interest and bring new shoppers there"
2553,"So our focus is really, just as it is within confection, how do we drive the category there and bring incrementality"
2554,"If I think about the competition, I think national players always tend to be pretty strong wherever they're established"
2555,And I think it sometimes more the regional players that experience pressure in those scenarios
2556,I would just say we've stated before that M&A is a piece of our capital strategy
2557,"We're particularly interested in companies with accelerating revenue growth, primarily within the U.S"
2558,$100 billion snack wheel
2559,"And certainly, are interested in companies that either complement our confectionery portfolio, our snacks business or our go-to-market"
2560,"Patricia, anything you want to add to that?"
2561,"And I think we're just always looking for propositions that are – everything we do is around creating shareholder value, whether it's on our base business or M&A"
2562,So that's always our lens
2563,"You know, it's a competitive marketplace and that's about all I would say, right, continues to be competitive marketplace out there from an M&A perspective"
2564,"Good morning, everyone"
2565,Our core business was strong in the third quarter
2566,We're very pleased with our ID sales exceeding 1% in the third quarter
2567,"We were especially happy to see the very strong performance on our fresh departments; the results in produce and meat were terrific, and we continue to see double-digit growth in natural foods"
2568,"Our ID sales results were driven by both, higher spend per unit and strong growth and the number of households"
2569,"Total visits continue to grow throughout the quarter, and our market share was up"
2570,Our businesses gained momentum and our customers are recognizing the investments we are making
2571,"We noted at our Investor Conference that over the next three years, Restock Kroger will be fuelled by $9 billion in capital investments, cost savings and free cash flow"
2572,"We recognized that in order for -- in order to be there for our customers today, and more importantly, to be where they are going in the future we need to make investments more aggressively and faster than ever before"
2573,We've already prioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process
2574,"We now look first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms; second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to those demands that were created through these investments"
2575,"Then finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity; this process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments"
2576,"As Rodney said earlier, we are aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold"
2577,One example is our recent decision to require on-time and in-fold delivery from suppliers
2578,We're implementing penalties when scheduled deliveries are missed within a designated window
2579,"Overtime, this will help keep cost standby on sharing more predictable operations, but more importantly, it won't share that we have the products on our shelves that our customers want and when they want them"
2580,We expect Restock Kroger to generate $400 million in incremental operating profit margin over to three years from 2018 to 2020. We also expect to generate more than $4 billion of free cash flow after dividends over the next three years
2581,Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business
2582,Fuel performance was also outstanding in the quarter
2583,Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.249 compared to $0.179 in the same quarter last year
2584,The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.17 in the same quarter last year
2585,This along with our strong core business results demonstrates the diversity of our earnings
2586,"The fuel performance in the quarter also created the opportunity for us to make an incremental, a $111 million contribution into our USC consolidated pension plan"
2587,Funding these obligations proactively overtime demonstrates our ability to meet our commitment to protect employee pensions while simultaneously delivering value for shareholders
2588,"As you know, we announced last month our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our convenience store business, including a potential sale"
2589,This was the result of review of assets that are potentially of more value outside the company that is part of Kroger; this process is ongoing and there has been a high level of interest
2590,"As we stressed last month, our convenience store management and associates are an important part of our success; we value what they do and thank them for continuing to put our customer first everyday as we conduct this evaluation"
2591,"Over the last four quarters we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion to company-sponsored pension plans, repurchase 59 million common shares for $1.7 billion, take $446 million in dividends and invest $2.9 billion in capital"
2592,Our financial strategy is to use our financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders and maintaining our current investment grade debt rating
2593,We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals
2594,"As of the end of the third quarter, our current share repurchase authorization had approximately $590 million remaining"
2595,In return on invested capital for the third quarter on a rolling four quarter basis was 12.31%
2596,Now I'm going to spend a lot more time talking about pensions this quarter than I normally would
2597,This is driven by not only what we've done this quarter but also what we've been doing over the past several years
2598,"About a decade ago we identified a great amount of exposure on pension plans and recognized then we would need to begin addressing that exposure like we would any big endeavor, one step at a time"
2599,Our efforts begin in earnest in 2011 when we negotiated and created the UFCW consolidated pension plan
2600,"The keys for us were capping prior service costs, negotiating a new benefit accrual going forward, consolidating four plans into one and sharing both, professional and more efficient management of the assets going forward"
2601,We agreed to fund the plan over five years but elected to fund it in January of 2012; this arrangement reduced Kroger's annual multi-employer pension expense and secured the pension benefits for tens of thousands of Kroger associates
2602,"Including this agreement, we have since made more than $2.3 billion in payments and funding commitments with two objectives in mind; one, to address the underfunding and the company sponsored pension plans, and two, to address the liabilities of various troubled multi-employer pension plans"
2603,"We have adopted this approach in a low interest rate environment to provide greater stability for the pension benefits earned by thousands of Kroger associates and retirees, and to manage these liability proactively or frankly, to avoid kicking the can down the road"
2604,"We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow, this is because we're bringing an off-balance sheet item on your balance sheet, we're funding an obligation already on our balance sheet"
2605,"As a result, we are updating our target range for this ratio to 2.2 to 2.4 times"
2606,"These obligations whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet have generally been considered when our credit profile has been reviewed but since they weren't funded, did not get picked up at our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio"
2607,Our current result of 2.57 times is above this range
2608,We expect to use free cash flow and potential proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in the range
2609,Protecting associates and retiree pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates
2610,"Another is hiring and job creation, Kroger is currently hiring total 14,000 part-time and seasonal jobs, this is in addition to the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs we've already created in 2017. Through Restock Kroger we plan to invest an incremental $500 million in human capital in wages, training and development over the next three years"
2611,"This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training"
2612,"On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia, and we're currently negotiating an agreement with the team stores [ph] for the master agreement"
2613,"Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefits for our associates"
2614,Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient healthcare and pension costs which some of our competitors do not face
2615,We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates
2616,The importance of growing our business and growing it profitably which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates
2617,"Turning now for our guidance for the fourth quarter of '17 and all of '17, we expect fuel margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and we're already seeing that quarter-to-date"
2618,We expect fourth quarter identical supermarket sales growth exceeding -- excluding fuel to exceed 1.1%
2619,We confirmed our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share and our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 a share
2620,Both our GAAP and adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance includes the effect of the hurricanes
2621,The low end of this range is $0.04 above where industry analyst consensus forecast has been demonstrating Kroger's ability to deliver shareholder value in a dynamic transition year
2622,"Our LIFO expectation has been lower to $60 million from $80 million and we expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be approximately $3 billion for 2017. Before I turn it back to Rodney, I want to note that in the 8-K we filed earlier today, we reconfirmed our early thoughts on 2018. Rodney?"
2623,What I talked about as far as moderation and margins in the fourth quarter was we expect our few margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and we've already been seeing that
2624,"What happened with gross margins this quarter, the 30 basis points without the fuel modern health and LIFO charge that we talked about in the earnings release, we have become significantly more diligent on lowering our cost of goods and negotiations with our vendors"
2625,"Our sales mix was very strong in the quarter relative to more natural foods and more our brands which helps drive our margin rate up and those did also continued price investments, our costs -- our inflation [ph] cost is still above our inflation at retail, if you go back to the chart I used at the investor conference but they are beginning to converge and both of them are now in positive territory"
2626,I don't want anybody to think we did invest in price in the quarter because we certainly did in a very big way and it's really the factors I talked about
2627,"I walk-in to the habit of revisiting that chart that were both over zero; so we did have cost inflation, as well as retail price inflation that got past on but we didn't pass all of it"
2628,I also walk-in into the habit of predicting where gross margins may go on a quarter-to-quarter basis because you never know exactly what negotiations or what benefits may fall on a particular quarter but we do feel good about the results we posted
2629,"As I sit here today, so there is two components of multi-employer expenses; there is one that we may got a sense per hour basis is part of our contracts to third-party plans that we don't manage, maybe trusting on those"
2630,So those will be whatever the hours we work in the contractual rate per hour; my guess is that you would see a slight increase -- some increase in that number
2631,"I think as you think about contributions to our multi-employer, to the UFCW plan that I talked about we created five years ago, as I sit here today I would expect that to be slightly less next year than this year given the contribution we just made, plus they are having a very nice year from a return on asset basis"
2632,"No, I mean you hit the nail in the head"
2633,We have been and we'll continue to invest in price and we have a lot of plans in place to figure out what is to pay for that
2634,"Unidentified Analyst And then my follow-up question is, if we to get tax reform and your tax rate go down significantly, how would you look to deploy that benefit to your P&L? Would you just let it flow to shareholders or would you look subsidized investments you might make with that savings?"
2635,"No, I agree with you"
2636,"And we obviously, announced our relationship with Instacart that we in Southern California which will be a prime example of what Rodney said we're on average smaller stores and smaller parking lots and this is a great solution for a market like that where it's just over the customers want but the physical assets we have wouldn't support it"
2637,"That's very, very much so and as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter and we solved their insights, it's what caused us to aggressively start doing ClickList and the only changes we made was asking the Harris Teeter team if you had to do it over again, what would you do differently, those things we have done but the patterns that we're seeing would be very similar to what we saw -- what Harris Teeter saw before we merged and what Harris Teeter continues to see"
2638,"Yes, sir"
2639,"It really doesn't, as we have more opportunities and negotiate more opportunities; if I could get all of these union contracts if I wouldn't want to do it [indiscernible], like I said in my prepared remarks, it's one step at a time on big endeavor like this; I would prefer to bring them all in balance sheet, manage the assets myself, get rid of a lot of friction cost"
2640,"One of the funds we consolidated, it was unbelievable, the management fees that were aimed, because their assets were so low"
2641,"And as you get a bigger pool of assets going after the same goal, you obviously get better fees, so there is lots of ways it reduced our cost and generally speaking, the rating agencies do get it and understand it; it's -- I think I'll allow this for a second and everybody in the room just kind of looked at me like -- but we've actually talked, should we start talking about the leverage ratio closer to exactly how the rating agencies do it, so there isn't this disconnect between the two and we just put everything after the way we believe they look at it, they don't tell you everything but -- and then it's not; it's volatile as it seems when we add something, so that's something we're kicking around just to take some of the -- what seems like a growth in our leverage when it's just moving it from one part to another"
2642,"I think I would just go back to what our strategy is and we would allocate our -- those proceeds to support all the pillars of our financial strategy, keeping in mind the contribution to the bottom line at those stores to generate; as well as the need to get our leverage ratio down"
2643,"Well, the expense that we incurred do not penetrate our insurance deductible, so it was contained at less than the $26 million I spoke off last quarter"
2644,It was in the $20 million to $25 million range
2645,"And when you think about where the hurricane sit and where we have stores, while it certainly helped the Houston division sales, the overall effect on the total company, given we have 20 to 100 stores and a 100 or so affected in Texas by the storm was relatively negligible to the overall number"
2646,We've never really tried to look at it as a power struggle and we really appreciate the partnerships we've had with our CBG suppliers
2647,"Relative to the find for the late trucks, it doesn't do us any good to have folks around our warehouse expecting trucks to show up and the truck doesn't show up or that we have orders in for products from our stores and we get a truck from a supplier that doesn't have all of the goods on it we expected it to have on it"
2648,"And not only are we incurring the cost at the warehouse for those ideal workers, it also winds up affecting sales when we can't fulfill the orders that our stores have asked for and then we can wind up with out-of-stocks or low stocks inside the store"
2649,"And it's really just trying to strengthen that relationship if it's supposed to get here today and it's supposed to be a full truckload, we'll get it to us today and make it a full truckload"
2650,"You know, this isn't within minutes of a window, this is a relatively wide window at this point and I would say the biggest thing on cost of goods is, we've always at the category manager level done a really good job of negotiating cost of goods"
2651,There have been times when they've made decisions historically that somewhere up the chain in the company we may have overturn the decision they made which causes them to think somebody doesn't have my back when I negotiate really diligently and get us a better cost of goods on our product
2652,"I can tell you today, the category manager negotiates a price or a product in our store, not in our store; that decision stands there because they are the ones with all the data and information about how that decision is made"
2653,"It's all those decisions are made, we don't just do this, give us the best price or you're out of the store"
2654,It's all made with a powerful data waiting for 51 behind it to understand consumer preferences and substitute ability and things like that
2655,So it's a pretty broadbased approach and I would say those two generally are the highlights
2656,"Our ship-to-home is an evolving process Scott and you know, as we've said in our conference call in the prepared remarks, we had a record Black Friday and Fred [ph] had a record Black Friday"
2657,"And when you talk about TVs, that's a record Black Friday relative to a few years ago where electronics would have been a huge part of their Black Fridays"
2658,"And it's -- not every customer wants things delivered to their house, there is still a joy and excitement of going out and shopping for things and we'll continue to offer and overtime offer more opportunities and options for our customers on how they want products delivered but when you think about this year's Black Friday being a record year, I think folks I brick-and-mortar [indiscernible] everything is going to get shipped at home or little bit ahead of themselves"
2659,"Thank you, Gerald"
2660,"We have delivered a strong business performance in the year, both in terms of adjusted profit and cash flow despite currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions"
2661,"In the fourth quarter, we recognized, of course, that our GAAP numbers have been significantly impacted by the Rite Aid-related costs, including the merger termination fees"
2662,"However, overall, on an adjusted basis, the final quarter was better mainly due to U.S"
2663,pharmacy volumes and market share continuing to grow in line with our strategy
2664,"As you know, on 29th June, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase program"
2665,"During the quarter, we purchased $3.8 billion of shares, and since the fiscal year-end, have completed the repurchases"
2666,"In keeping with our commitment to operate as efficient a balance sheet as possible, we've decided to add an additional $1 billion to the program"
2667,This is in addition to our routine anti-dilutive share repurchases
2668,"Of course, our other recent news was Rite Aid regulatory clearance in September, which I'll come onto shortly"
2669,"First, I will take you through our fourth quarter results"
2670,"As we indicated throughout the year, we expected the fourth quarter to be particularly strong"
2671,"As you can see, this is the case"
2672,"Currency had a negative impact, the U.S"
2673,dollar being around 4.4% stronger versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year
2674,This impact was less significant than in the first three quarters
2675,"Sales for the quarter were $30.1 billion, up 5.3% versus the comparable quarter"
2676,"On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.4%"
2677,"GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 2.3%"
2678,"GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $802 million, down 22.1% and diluted EPS was $0.76. This was 20% lower than the comparable quarter last year due to Rite Aid-related costs, mainly merger termination fees"
2679,"Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, up 21.2%, and in constant currency, up 22.3%"
2680,"Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 18.8%, and in constant currency, up 19.1%"
2681,"Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.31, up 22.4%"
2682,"The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 24.6%"
2683,This was 6.3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year
2684,"When you'll recall, we particularly benefited from positive discrete items"
2685,"Our core tax rate, which excludes discrete tax impacts, was in line with our rate in the third quarter"
2686,"So turning now to the performance of our segments, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA"
2687,"Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $22.3 billion, up 7.5% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.1%"
2688,"Adjusted gross profit was $5.6 billion, up 4.3% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in both pharmacy and retail"
2689,"Adjusted SG&A was 18.9% of sales, an improvement of 1.8 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter"
2690,Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales has improved versus comparable quarters for 17 consecutive quarters
2691,"Adjusted operating margin was 6.3%, up 1 percentage point, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 27.5%"
2692,"So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy"
2693,U.S
2694,pharmacy total sales were up 12.6%
2695,"We filled 250.2 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 9%"
2696,"On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, our pharmacy sales increased by 5.6% with scripts filled up 8.7%"
2697,This was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships
2698,"Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics"
2699,"Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.5%, up approximately 120 basis points over the year-ago quarter"
2700,Total retail sales were down 3.9% on the same quarter last year
2701,This includes the impact of the previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations
2702,"Comparable retail sales were down 2.1% in the quarter, with declines in consumables and general merchandise and the personal care categories partially offset by growth in the beauty and health and wellness categories"
2703,"Compared to prior quarters, comparable sales were lower, partially through changes to our promotional plans as we focused on delivering improved margins"
2704,"Gross profit and margin were higher than in the same quarter last year, mainly due to actions we took in the fourth quarter last year to put in place foundations for long-term growth"
2705,"In addition, margin was higher due to the changes to promotions, as I just mentioned, and improved mix as we increasingly focus on higher-margin categories"
2706,"On the last call I told you that we were implementing a program in approximately 1,500 stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance"
2707,"This program has now been completed and we're starting to see the early benefits, including ongoing efficiencies and reduced working capital"
2708,Our beauty differentiation program has driven profit and margin improvement as our own brands continued to perform well
2709,"Beauty category sales in beauty differentiation stores continued to be markedly better than in other stores, supported by strong sales growth of No7 and Soap & Glory"
2710,In line with our strategy of introducing new owned brands to our U.S
2711,"stores, we launched two terrific cosmetics brands during the quarter"
2712,"CYO is our new and exciting makeup collection developed by Boots in Nottingham, which is designed to encourage our younger customers to be colorful and creative"
2713,"We have, in addition, launched Sleek MakeUP in Walgreens stores and online after a successful launch in Boots two years ago"
2714,"Sleek is one of our fastest-growing brands in the UK, with a young, ethnically diverse customer base"
2715,"Since the year-end, we have launched a brand-new skincare range, YourGoodSkin, which is exclusive to Walgreens and Boots"
2716,"Developed by our scientists, the product is designed to promote visibly healthier skin"
2717,"As well as developing our offer of own brands, as I said on the last earnings call, we are introducing our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores"
2718,"This program is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, bringing the total number of stores with the enhanced beauty offering to around 2,900. So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division"
2719,"Sales for the division were $2.9 billion, down 0.4% in constant currency"
2720,Comparable store sales decreased 0.2% in constant currency
2721,"Comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher prescription volumes in the UK, with Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales up 1.2%"
2722,"Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 0.5%, with Boots UK's comparable retail sales decreasing 1.3%"
2723,"This was due to a decline across a number of product categories, with beauty being impacted by the timing of new product launches"
2724,"We've continued our work on cost control in the quarter, while putting in place the foundations for future growth"
2725,"Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 0.8% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, mainly due to lower retail gross profit"
2726,"This was more than compensated by lower adjusted SG&A, which was down versus the year-ago quarter on a constant currency basis"
2727,"As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A on a constant currency basis was 0.9 percentage points lower at 32.8%, reflecting work we have done to reduce costs, particularly in the UK"
2728,"Adjusted operating margin was 8.9%, up 0.8 percentage points in constant currency"
2729,"This resulted in adjusted operating income of $261 million, an increase of 8.9%, again, in constant currency"
2730,This was a much better performance than in the first three quarters due to the measures we've taken to reduce costs
2731,So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division
2732,"Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, up 5.4% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis"
2733,"This was ahead of the company's estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with growth in emerging markets and the UK being partially offset by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe"
2734,"Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.5%, down 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis"
2735,"This was mainly due to lower gross margin, including some generic procurement pressures in the quarter"
2736,"The division benefited from $84 million in adjusted earnings from ABC, up $34 million versus the same quarter last year, mainly due to our increased level of ownership"
2737,"Adjusted operating income was $221 million, up 11.5% in constant currency"
2738,"So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2017. As I've said, this has been a strong financial year, with results coming in just above the top end of our guidance"
2739,"In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.78 was down 1%"
2740,"This decrease primarily reflects a number of special items, including, as I said previously, the Rite Aid merger termination fees"
2741,"Importantly, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 11.1% to $5.10, up 12.9% in constant currency"
2742,The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.2%
2743,"During the year, we particularly benefited from favorable discrete items"
2744,"As ever, the tax rate also reflects the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings and the U.S"
2745,taxation of our non-U.S
2746,entities
2747,Operating cash flow was $2 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion in the full fiscal year
2748,"Over the course of the year, our working capital inflow was $1.5 billion, reflecting improved payables and lower days inventory"
2749,"As a result of our focus on driving working capital efficiency, over the last two years, we've generated $2.9 billion of positive cash flow"
2750,Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $439 million
2751,"For the fiscal year, expenditure totaled $1.4 billion, which was broadly in line with last year"
2752,"We continued to invest in key areas to develop our core customer proposition, including our stores and U.S"
2753,"beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we've previously talked about"
2754,"Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $1.6 billion and an impressive $5.9 billion in the full fiscal year"
2755,"In addition to the share repurchase program, which I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we made early repayments of $2.6 billion of debt to further optimize our balance sheet"
2756,So turning next to Rite Aid
2757,"As you know, in September, we secured regulatory clearance for the purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores and related assets"
2758,"We're delighted to be completing this transaction, which will extend our network, particularly in the Northeast and Southern states"
2759,"In the past week, we've acquired the first stores to confirm the operational readiness of the key Rite Aid transitional IT systems"
2760,"We will then begin acquiring stores in phases with completion anticipated in spring 2018. To deliver the full benefit of the acquisition, we must, of course, fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores into the Walgreens network"
2761,"This is a relatively complex, time-consuming and costly process"
2762,"Initially, Rite Aid is providing transitional services for all acquired stores"
2763,"Over time, we will transfer these stores onto Walgreens' existing IT systems prior to rebranding as Walgreens with our full retail offer"
2764,We expect to complete the integration of the acquired stores and related assets within the next three years
2765,The acquisition-related costs of this are estimated to be approximately $750 million
2766,"In addition, we plan to invest around $500 million in incremental capital expenditure on store conversions and related activities"
2767,"As previously announced, we expect to realize synergies of over $300 million per annum, which we anticipate realizing within the next four years"
2768,"Following regulatory clearance, we have been able to complete a comprehensive review of the combined store portfolio to determine the scope for optimizing locations"
2769,"This has resulted in our decision to close approximately 600 stores and related assets over an 18-month period, beginning in spring 2018. We estimate the cost of this program to be approximately $450 million, substantially all cash spend"
2770,"The resulting cost savings are expected to be approximately $300 million per annum by the end of the fiscal year 2020. We will, of course, when reporting our adjusted operating results, adjust out both the acquisition-related and optimization program costs"
2771,"So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2018. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. As usual, this guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year"
2772,"As we've said before, we do not expect the Rite Aid transaction to significantly impact adjusted diluted net earnings per share in this period"
2773,"As I'm sure you'll appreciate, the recent hurricanes have been very challenging and continue to be so in Puerto Rico, where Walgreens is the largest pharmacy chain"
2774,We are very proud of all our people who have worked tirelessly to give our customers access to the medicines they need
2775,"Based on our work to-date, our initial estimates indicate that the cost of the storm damage and store closures could be around $90 million"
2776,The majority of this is in Puerto Rico
2777,We plan to adjust for this when reporting our first quarter results
2778,"The damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure continues to impact everyday life, including trading in our stores"
2779,"We estimate that in the first quarter, this could adversely impact adjusted earnings per share by a few cents"
2780,Moving on to Med Part D
2781,"Although it's not our usual practice to comment on future sales expectations, given recent market speculation, I feel that it's worthwhile to point out that in 2018, we're expecting Walgreens to grow its Med Part D business year-over-year"
2782,"While not material, you should also note that our partnership agreement with Fareva, which includes the sale of our contract manufacturing business, this will commence at the end of October"
2783,"As a result, in the future, we won't have these low margin sales within Retail Pharmacy International"
2784,"Thinking about phasing, we expect this year to be more balanced between the two halves"
2785,I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments
2786,Really nothing to – I really don't have much to add to what we said in the prepared statements and just what Alex has said
2787,"Just I think the one thing I would add to Alex, if you remember in the third quarter when we were looking at gross profit percentage and RPI, I drew attention to the fact that we'd obviously post the establishment of the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime joint venture, which we consolidate"
2788,"If you recall, I said that impacted the mix by about 100 basis points, and of course we didn't have a full three months in at that time"
2789,So it's just worth bearing that in mind
2790,"But I mean, we're very pleased, as you can see, with the progress that we're making in both the retail and the pharmacy part of our business in the States"
2791,"Thanks, George"
2792,I very much tried in my prepared remarks to really point you in the direction of our thinking
2793,"Obviously, we don't give specific guidance on adjusted operating growth in total or in our divisions, but I think from what you've said, you'll gather that we're very confident that we can continue to grow our business through that combination of driving the top line, managing the margins and obviously, keeping a very, very tight control of the costs because saving costs is very much our way of life"
2794,"The one thing I would sort of just, I think, remind everyone is, of course, that in this new fiscal year, we'll have a full year of contribution from the Prime acquisition which resulted in the forming of our AllianceRx business"
2795,"Well, the main cost transformation program, obviously, we completed that last year and we were delighted with the results and the costs, as you've seen, have come in exactly where we anticipated them to be"
2796,"In terms of the store optimization program that we've announced today, clearly the majority of that is cash and then we're going to have the investment in the capital in the Rite Aid stores and the conversion and the rebranding"
2797,And so we've tried to give that factor into guidance
2798,But I'm very confident about our ability to continue to deliver a really strong cash flow
2799,"I think as I explained in my remarks, we had another very strong year for cash flow in the year just ended, the same the prior year"
2800,"We were really able to really continue, in particular, to improve our working capital efficiency"
2801,"We talk a lot about driving cost efficiency, which is a way of life, but similarly continuing to improve working capital is a way of life as well"
2802,And so I'm very confident that we're going to continue to really be a very strong cash generative business going forward
2803,"And obviously, when it comes to the returns on all the projects that we do, similarly as I think we've said on many times, we're very disciplined in the way we evaluate all our capital expenditure and investment programs"
2804,And I'm very confident that we'll get the returns on those
2805,"Thanks, Bryan"
2806,"Again, as you know, the sizable amount of these stores, not the majority in this occasion, have been remodeled"
2807,"So therefore, they are in good shape"
2808,"However, there are some which are very important just from a network point of view that would require some additional capital"
2809,"And also as we develop the front-end proposition in Walgreens further, we'll have the opportunity to move some of that investment with a good return also into these stores"
2810,"So again George has mentioned a figure for, not just for integration, but a figure also of $0.5 billion"
2811,I think it was more or less for capital improvement into the stores that we're buying and remaining open going forward
2812,"Eric, if you worked for Walgreens, you know that you'd know the answer, but unfortunately, we can't give you the answer"
2813,"We don't give that level of details, and I'm really sorry we can't give that"
2814,But we keep on reassuring you that we understand the model really well
2815,We are working diligently to apply that model appropriately in the U.S
2816,and we believe we're making strong progress and you can see that coming through at an economic value that Stefano described
2817,"So again, we're into almost 3,000, 2,900 stores with the differentiation"
2818,We have farther to go much more opportunity there
2819,"You can see that we have also materially improved the cost of goods, both in the retail side and also on the generic side, again, (55:45) that constant working with suppliers and long-term ways to make that happen"
2820,And you can see how we are carefully investing our cash as well as our operating costs to drive improvements in volume and also improvements in customer experience
2821,"Our internal Net Promoter Score's and many of our brand measures are improving going forward towards more of a pharmacy-led health, wellness and beauty retailer"
2822,So we continue to work diligently on this model
2823,We continue to believe strongly that we absolutely know more about the American market has achieved it
2824,"We understand the customer is changing, we understand the market is changing and we will adapt appropriately"
2825,"So again, I don't know what more we can say"
2826,We can't give you any more detail
2827,But I promise you that we are satisfied with the progress we are making
2828,"Hi, Ricky"
2829,"Again, just on the FedEx point, I just want to say what a fantastic partnership we have here"
2830,"And also when you think about the idea of the last mile and having the ability to really deliver in the last mile, we believe this FedEx partnership, which we've rolled out in a matter of months to every single drugstore apart from those affected by the hurricane, as Stefano said, is not available to our customers and to FedEx's business partners as well"
2831,So I think that's just one quick example of how we are rapidly changing with the market as it rapidly changes
2832,"And I think that this idea of the last mile, which many people are struggling with, many – particularly the online business are struggling with"
2833,"I think the stat in the marketplace is that 30% of e-commerce get returned, for example, parcels get returned, reversal in the supply chain is a big customer problem"
2834,Piracy is a big customer problem
2835,"We believe that with the best last mile, working with people at FedEx and many others, we can solve some of these problems for businesses and for customers and that's what we intend to do"
2836,"So, Ricky, I didn't quite catch your question"
2837,Could you repeat your question? I apologize
2838,I couldn't quite hear the end of your question
2839,"In pharmacy, yeah, I mean, obviously, that's an opportunity going forward"
2840,We look at – we work hard on costs and still reducing that cost in the pharmacy
2841,"We are very convenient, close to many, many customers, both patients and people who buy retail products, I said before"
2842,So that's an opportunity for sure that we are looking at and I'm going to let you know if we do anything about it
2843,But that is certainly one of the opportunities with this partnership
2844,I'll take up on that
2845,"But on the guidance, obviously, on our prepared comments, you've seen we just gave guidance at the adjusted EPS level, so we haven't given the composition"
2846,"But notwithstanding that, I would really stress that we are continuing to look to drive SG&A efficiencies"
2847,It's very much a way of life
2848,"Clearly, we'll have additional costs coming in as we go through the Rite Aid transition"
2849,So we won't be quite comparing apples with apples as we go through that period
2850,But the focus on improving SG&A will continue to be absolutely relentless
2851,It's just the way of life
2852,"We will, of course, also then have the mix effect from the Prime because we'll have Prime acquisition because we'll have a full year in the coming year and I think as Alex has already explained, there's a mix effect in terms of, it's a lower percentage gross margin by nature"
2853,"In terms of the tax rate, we've not given specific guidance for tax, but as I said in my prepared comments, our effective tax rate excluding ABC equity income was 23.2%"
2854,"Within that, there was a couple of percent of discrete items"
2855,"So, excluding discretes, we were 25.2%"
2856,"And of course, the level of discretes can tend to vary year-by-year"
2857,"The final point, really, would be post, in terms of you thinking tax post Rite Aid, and of course, we will have a higher proportion of income as we start to see the accretion come through from Rite Aid over time and we will start to have a higher proportion, other things being equal, in the U.S"
2858,", which of course continues to be one of the highest tax rates really in the world at the moment"
2859,"We've not given the specific guidance beyond what we've said in numerical terms, but to help you with your thinking, in terms of the Rite Aid stores, we'll be acquiring them on a phased basis"
2860,"And as we've said, we've just acquired the first few in the last week or so to start testing the IT systems"
2861,"So we'll be acquiring those on a phased basis over the next six, seven months until the spring of next year"
2862,"We then have the store optimization program which I talked about, which Alex has elaborated on a little more detail, which is when we acquire the stores over time, we then have to really treat them like internal file buys and do the conversion"
2863,"And that is going to take roughly – we've got an 18-month program from the spring of 2018 through to the end of 2019. And then we have got to convert – as we convert the existing stores, we've got to do the remerchandising, the rebranding, putting in our IT systems, getting everyone trained up, particularly the pharmacists on our pharmacy management program, which is very important part and obviously moved the logistics over"
2864,"So really, as we've said originally, it will take a number of years to complete that till we absolutely see the full benefit from the Rite Aid transaction, which we're very confident about"
2865,"As I said before, we only give guidance on one number"
2866,"A lot of our focus is on improving our offer, as Alex has said, and driving overall shareholder value creation of profit"
2867,"And mix, it's not just all about driving the top line, what's important is growing in a profitable way"
2868,"And we're very disciplined in the way we evaluate our promotions so that we don't unnecessarily promote when it doesn't make economic sense to do so, and we're very focused on improving the mix"
2869,"And I think as Alex had said again a few minutes ago, the lessons that we learned from Boots in particularly developing our own differentiated offering, particularly in the beauty area is a key component of being able to do that"
2870,"And of course, it offers our customers fantastic products at fantastic value"
2871,"Really, I would just re-emphasize what I said in guidance"
2872,"As I said, I think that in the phasing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect this to be more balanced but between the two halves"
2873,"I think when we gave guidance a year ago, we always explained that fiscal 2017 would be more weighted towards the final quarter"
2874,"And obviously, the results that we've announced today demonstrate that"
2875,"So I would think, think more balanced would be really the best way of thinking about it"
2876,"Sure, Charles"
2877,"As Stefano said, we have a lot of pilots and tests in the marketplace"
2878,"Again, we are very pleased with the progress on all of them"
2879,"They're really testing, at this stage, consumer behavior"
2880,We'll currently (01:16:17) get consumers and patients to see us differently and use these services that we are now providing
2881,"So just some examples, LabCorp, as you said, that's a recent one"
2882,"That's early, but the early indications are positive"
2883,"And of course, we learned something from the previous experience we had in terms of customer experience with the team we had before"
2884,"Secondly, we are moving to an increased number of pilots in optical"
2885,"We have a big business in the UK, a very successful business in the UK and global partnerships with the most important partners in this industry in the UK and are bringing all of that knowhow to the American market"
2886,"And again, we're pleased with the progress so far"
2887,"Hearingcare, again, we have a successful business in the UK"
2888,"We understand the model very well and again, we're bringing that here to the U.S"
2889,in a test and trial here in the U.S
2890,"And again, that's happening just after Christmas"
2891,"And last but not least, we talked about urgent care where, again, with MedExpress, we're in the ground (01:17:25) in urgent care"
2892,"And again, that is going well so far"
2893,"So again, using our physical convenient locations, using our healthcare brand, working in partnerships to give them access to our Walgreens customers and of course, working together to make sure that we target people through data in the most appropriate ways are all part of what we're doing right now in terms of developing new business models in that healthcare space"
2894,"All work in progress, all being properly managed, all with the best partners in the U.S"
2895,"market and so far, so good"
2896,It's really early
2897,"I mean, at the moment, we're really I go back to – we're looking at customer behavior and how that's changing inside of the Walgreens brand and inside the Walgreens box, the properties"
2898,And it's very encouraging
2899,"So, of course, we'll analyze what we bring"
2900,"We bring great locations, we bring a great brand to which customers associate healthcare"
2901,"But we also, as Stefano said, believe in partnerships"
2902,We believe in not having to build things that already successfully built
2903,So we will assess all of that in urgent care
2904,"But you're right, more and more healthcare is going to be delivered in communities and many people see the drugstores today as an ideal place to deliver these healthcare services"
2905,"And of course, we are doing lots of work to understand what that could look like in the future, as I said, with the very best partners and urgent care, for sure, is a good example of that"
2906,"Sure, yeah"
2907,"We rolled something called take back out, I believe it was about 18 months ago was our first take back"
2908,"And now, we've now got that in 800 pharmacies evenly spread across the U.S"
2909,"And we're now expanding that by another I, think, it's 800 in partnership with our key partners to provide that service even closer to communities in America"
2910,So people can bring back their unwanted drugs out of their bathroom cabinets to make sure they're not available for misuse
2911,"That program is going very well, I think and the ones we have at the moment, we've got about, I think, it's 80 million tons of drugs back, so that program is going very well and we're delighted that others are also doing that now as well"
2912,"Secondly, pharmacist education, really important and we're making sure that pharmacists really understand how to deal with this issue in a positive way through Good Faith Dispensing as a program has been in place for many years and we continue to drive that and improve that"
2913,"And thirdly, we're working with the industry to make sure that any other opportunities there are to play an active part in preventing this situation, we play a role in as well"
2914,No
2915,I think we've always had a mail business
2916,We combined it with Prime's mail business as part of the AllianceRx deal that we announced last summer
2917,So we're always looking for ways to reduce cost to fill
2918,"We believe that the position of our network, which is closer to customers than any other network in the U.S"
2919,A
2920,allows us to have a lower cost last mail and give customers the flexibility of being able to receive the prescriptions in their pharmacy and potentially at home
2921,"So, of course, we're looking at that option"
2922,"But really I think that's not a response to Amazon, it's a response to the customer opportunity we have"
2923,"Well, thanks Bill (1:56) and good morning everyone"
2924,"Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California, and the smokeless products segment has largely rebounded from its first quarter voluntary product recall"
2925,We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment delivered 6.4% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter as strong pricing more than offset volume declines and higher promotional investments
2926,"For the first half, smokeable products segment adjusted operating companies income grew 7.2%"
2927,"As I mentioned, the smokeable segment's results were negatively impacted by California's $2 per pack cigarette excise tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. California is a high-volume state, previously accounting for approximately 7% of total U.S"
2928,cigarette industry volume
2929,"Following the tax increase, California's volume contribution dropped to 5% which drove total U.S"
2930,industry volume down approximately 4.5% in the quarter
2931,"In addition, Marlboro has a strong share in California of over 50%"
2932,Thus Marlboro was disproportionally impacted by the tax increase contributing to its decline of 0.3 of a national retail share point in the second quarter to 43.5%
2933,We expect these dynamics will continue to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half
2934,"Outside of California, Marlboro's second quarter share remains stable, sequentially"
2935,"Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most disruptive immediately following implementation, after which the rate of decline moderates"
2936,"We continue to anticipate an approximate 1% negative impact on industry volumes for the full year as a result of the excise tax increases in California on April 1, and Pennsylvania last August"
2937,"Looking to the back half of the year, PM USA recently announced the national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72's, a product PM USA expects will further enhance Marlboro's position in the growing menthol segment and among adult smokers age 21 to 29. Moving to the smokeless products segment"
2938,USSTC has largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall
2939,It delivered 9.8% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter
2940,"USSTC grew smokeless products volume 1.4% in the quarter and gained retail share sequentially, growing 0.6 of a share point over the first quarter"
2941,USSTC estimates that the recall had about a half of a share point impact on its total retail share in the second quarter
2942,And Copenhagen continued to gain ground in the second quarter growing 0.7 of a retail share point to a record share of 34.1%
2943,"That was a particularly strong performance as it lapped the Copenhagen Mint national expansion in 2016. Through the first half, Copenhagen remains both the largest and the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco product in the U.S"
2944,"On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 0.7 of a share point in the second quarter, driven by Skoal's 1.4 share point decline"
2945,"For the first half, combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 0.6 of a share point"
2946,"The smokeless products segment delivered 1.6% adjusted operating companies income growth for the first half of 2017, as higher pricing was partially offset by the first quarter recall"
2947,"Now that the product recall is complete and trade inventories are substantially replenished, USSTC is well-positioned moving into the second half of the year"
2948,Finally an update on our innovative tobacco products efforts
2949,"In e-vapor, Nu Mark's MarkTen brand continues to grow volume and retail share"
2950,It is currently the number two e-vapor brand nationally with a second quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream channels
2951,MarkTen is now present in stores representing nearly 65% of e-vapor volume in those channels
2952,"And among stores, with MarkTen distribution through the full second quarter, MarkTen's retail share was approximately 24%"
2953,We're pleased with MarkTen's progress and Nu Mark plans to continue growing the brand in the back half
2954,"In heated tobacco, the FDA began its substantive review of Philip Morris International's modified risk tobacco product application for IQOS in late May"
2955,"The FDA published PMI's Executive Summary and research summaries to its website for public review and comment, and the agency plans to publish additional sections of the application on a rolling basis"
2956,We continue to work closely with PMI throughout the review process
2957,"As a reminder, PMI submitted its pre-market tobacco product application for IQOS to the FDA on March 31. Our team at PM USA continues to build its U.S"
2958,commercialization plans which we look forward to sharing with you in the future
2959,I'll wrap up with guidance
2960,"Obviously, our business fundamentals remain strong"
2961,We continue to expect higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year as some first half headwinds moderate and because the fourth quarter will include equity earnings from our beer investment whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 did not
2962,"As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth"
2963,Here's Billy for more details on our performance
2964,"Hi, Vivien"
2965,"Yes, we can – I'll get Billy maybe to talk about the geography in a minute"
2966,"But, when we look at it, it looks like churn in the discount category to us"
2967,"The gain in deep discount, so for reference for people who – we're referring to the quarterly metrics report where we put these data in that Billy referenced"
2968,And we show there that the discount category has not grown year-over-year
2969,"In fact, it's essentially flat down a tenth"
2970,But there is some difference between the branded discount which is down five tenths and deep discount which is up 4. So it looks to us like it's basically churn there
2971,"I mean importantly for us, there does not appear to have any significant effect on Marlboro or in L&M"
2972,"Indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up a tenth over the half"
2973,"Billy can talk about the geographies, but there's no question that when you have a major excise tax increase in a state, some people do trade down"
2974,"I don't know, Billy, you want to talk about discount?"
2975,"Yes, sure"
2976,"Overall, Vivien, I would say that we continue to have a largely constructed view of the economic situation of our consumer"
2977,"Unemployment's down, housing is up, wage gains are starting to come through"
2978,"All the stuff that we talk about all the time, so I won't repeat that"
2979,That looks to us to be pretty stable
2980,"Gas prices are up a little bit, but not remarkably so in a way that affects our business"
2981,"I think what you may be getting at though that there is a segment of consumers in our category who will go into the store and ask the clerk for the lowest-priced brand, and they may be picking up some share there but again, it appears to be coming out of perhaps the branded discount segment without certainly no effect on our brands, so we don't see it in premium, generally"
2982,I hope that's helpful
2983,Okay
2984,"Yes, thanks for calling"
2985,We do not see that
2986,"I think it's basically a function of price, Adam"
2987,I guess the honest answer is
2988,"Yes, I think I understand the question, thank you"
2989,That's why we do a range
2990,"And I think the range is sufficiently broad that, look, if you could predict your EPS with perfect prescience, you would put out a number, but you can't of course because of dynamics, again, you see it again this year as well"
2991,So we try to have the range to be broad enough to cover all that
2992,We put our best thinking into what we can do within the range and that does include what we expect out of our beer investment
2993,"So the answer is yes, it's all in the guidance and we think the range is sufficiently broad to cover it"
2994,"No, I don't think so"
2995,I think we were thoughtful about putting the guidance together at the first of the year and I think that we are comfortable with the guidance range we have at this point in time
2996,"Hi, Michael"
2997,Let me try to tackle those
2998,I think that you know what the strategy is
2999,"We're trying to maximize income in the segment, and that's a balance between that and making sure we have momentum on the key brands including Marlboro"
3000,So the share on Marlboro is down primarily because of the California effect
3001,But other metrics on Marlboro continue to be strong
3002,Its equity is great
3003,"As you can see, we've got very good pricing through the first half, Michael"
3004,The demographics have stabilized since Marlboro architecture
3005,We just have a massive increase in California
3006,"We over-index in California, and so I think that explains that"
3007,"The competitive environment I think we would describe as, it's always competitive"
3008,It may be useful for a couple of comments on that
3009,"One is if you think of competitive activity as occurring within say a band, it looks to us like the competitive activity remains within the band although perhaps a bit on the high side of the band"
3010,"We have some promotional launches and some promotional activity from other competitors but we monitor that carefully, as you know"
3011,And what we basically do is we adjust as we need to adjust
3012,So I think it's pretty steady as she goes and we're very happy
3013,"When you look at the income performance in the smokeable segment at more than 7% for the first half, despite the California increase, I think that they're doing a great job over there in line with their strategy"
3014,"Well, look, we're preparing to be ready on the nominal timelines that the FDA has said with respect to approving those applications"
3015,Your question correctly implies of course that's not completely within our control and it could take longer than that
3016,That's why we're investing in with discipline
3017,We're trying not to over-spend on the front end but we will certainly make the appropriate investments once we know we're go
3018,So the way we look at it is we're going to be ready at the earliest moment to proceed expeditiously
3019,"If it turns out to be longer, we have contingency plans in place to do that"
3020,"It's just not within our control, so we try not to fret too much about that, we just try to be ready when we can go"
3021,"Hey, Chris"
3022,"I'll take the second one first, and then I'll ask Billy to comment on the elasticity question, Chris"
3023,We have not observed that in our category at c-store
3024,We've been reading carefully the reports
3025,"We've seen others comment on that, but at least with respect to our category, we have not seen that yet"
3026,"Well, you see that on almost all the metrics the business bounced back terrifically in the second quarter, it's just that when you're out of the market and you lose your share, it just takes longer to gain the share back"
3027,And so I think we said at the first quarter call that we expected to gain that back over the course of the year and we were trying to point out the gain that we made in the second quarter of I think 0.6 sequentially
3028,"So I think we'll get it back over the course of the year, but it doesn't bounce back immediately"
3029,"Good morning, Judy"
3030,"Well, I'll speak to the inventory movements"
3031,"I won't speak to guidance on volume, particularly around numbers because you know we don't do that, but you're right to point out the factors"
3032,We do have some trade inventory as we point out in the metrics report that built in the second quarter
3033,"And as you know, Judy, it all kind of normalizes over the course of the year, and so in the back half, that'll pay itself back, I'm sure"
3034,I know you remember we have one fewer shipping day in the third quarter and then we have to work our way through this effect that Billy was just discussing with Chris about the volume declines that are resulting from the cigarette excise tax increase
3035,"So those are all the dynamics, but we have not put out a number about third-quarter volume"
3036,"Let me share with you some of the macro data that we have, just to get everybody oriented"
3037,"In 2016 we estimated that the spend in the category was about $2.5 billion; that was flat to 2015. But we have seen a pick-up both in volume and in dollar sales in 2017. So I don't know, maybe 8% on volume year-over-year"
3038,And then there's been some price mix as you know
3039,"A lot of that is driven by MarkTen, which has really gotten traction with the consumer and we put out some share numbers on that today"
3040,"The other phenomenon that's happening in the category as I know you know, is there's poly use"
3041,"So adult tobacco consumers do shift between segments of the tobacco category, and I think that what you're seeing as vapor moves up and down, and maybe even MST, is you see people moving among and between those categories"
3042,"I think those are all factors that go into the growth rate for vapor and then of course, when there's new technologies that are put in the market, we find high trial and that drives some of the growth"
3043,"We have an engagement plan that we're talking to public policy officials, to state tax officials and others, and I am encouraged that there is, I think a more broad acknowledgement among public policy people these days that harm reduction is the way forward and that tax policy will be an important component of that"
3044,It makes good sense to try to encourage people to migrate to products that may hold out less harm
3045,"We are particularly pitching that in the states, but as you know, state excise tax structures are highly complex and idiosyncratic by state, so the reception varies from state to state"
3046,But we are out there sharing our views about that and trying as best we can to persuade people to be thoughtful about that
3047,Welcome
3048,Okay
3049,"We have noticed that some people have commented on that, so I'm glad to have a chance to talk about the replenishment"
3050,"Actually, I think it's going pretty well"
3051,"If we look at – I don't know, we went back and looked at some data through June and with a small exception of maybe, I don't know, call it two, three or four SKUs, all of the orders were being completely fulfilled"
3052,So that's a pretty quick snap back from a recall and a transition from a two-factory environment to a one-factory environment
3053,I'd like to take the occasion to congratulate the UST team on such a good job
3054,There was a brief hiatus during the July 4 holiday
3055,Our people have been working very hard in the factory and we gave them an appropriate July 4 holiday
3056,And there was a short period there where a few more SKUs were not available and we had to limit some orders
3057,"But on the whole, the vast majority of the SKUs are at full fulfillment, and as you can see from the numbers in the second quarter by the smokeless team, I think they've done a very good job"
3058,So our view is that we're pretty much back in business in the smokeless business
3059,We have not seen any pantry loading that I'm aware of
3060,Sure
3061,"Well, there's a group of people that are trying to take decisions away from other adults and we oppose that"
3062,And we thought that was very bad public policy
3063,"You know our position on menthol because we've articulated it extremely thoroughly at the FDA, and as a matter of first instance, if there's going to be anything done on menthol, it ought to be done by the agency that has the expertise to assess whether the science and the evidence supports it"
3064,"In our view, and the view of many others who weighed in on the FDA, is that there is not"
3065,"For San Francisco to try to create its own set of rules out there doesn't seem to be good public policy to us, but this happens"
3066,"Local jurisdictions have views about tobacco issues and while we fight them, they go ahead and reimplement them"
3067,Obviously it's a tiny fraction of the volume
3068,Thanks for calling in
3069,"Well, I don't want to talk about forward pricing as you can appreciate, and I think that the dynamics are well understood, Matt, about what we have out there"
3070,"I tried to articulate them in terms of the inventory, but I'm not going to talk about forward pricing of course"
3071,"Well, there are other jurisdictions that have implemented it"
3072,"And my guess, what I would say is that while we continue to think we have strong arguments, it's fair to observe that we have not been able to block them in other jurisdictions"
3073,"It always depends a bit on state law and other factors, but we'd like to have public policy defer to the experts but they often don't and sometimes the courts are reluctant to interfere with that"
3074,So it can be uphill
3075,I hope so
3076,It's in the ag bill as you know and I thought that the – we were happy to get it past the committee and that predicate date really needs to be changed
3077,I think there is widespread understanding that the predicate date issue should be changed
3078,"It's a very, very complex environment in Washington, to state the obvious, and so we'll have to see where it goes in the budget"
3079,"But I think that there is a lot of support for that amendment and we continue to work that very, very hard"
3080,"Matt, thanks for calling"
3081,"Well, thanks for your question"
3082,I appreciate you calling in
3083,"As you might expect, I've been spending my time this morning thinking about this call, so I didn't have a lot of time to review the BAT material"
3084,I did see the headline statement apparently that they're going to pursue an FDA application for glo
3085,"Our plans assume the following which is, because the application is in by PMI in the United States and we're working that we expect to have first mover advantage"
3086,"But our plans also assume in our category that we will have competition, so I think both scenarios are covered"
3087,Welcome back
3088,"It's too small, and it's so idiosyncratic because it's an island that it's just hard to extrapolate from it"
3089,I think we had said previously when we studied California that we had not seen any significant effects there and obviously we'll be monitoring New Jersey very carefully
3090,Welcome back
3091,"Yes, the integration is well underway"
3092,I think that we're doing very well against the plan we have
3093,We're working on the branding strategies now
3094,"Obviously getting our arms around the factory and we'll have more news on Nat Sherman in the back half of the year, but we're very pleased with how it's gone so far, Michael"
3095,Thanks
3096,"Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us this morning"
3097,I am pleased to report that our second quarter results were very much in line with our expectations and that we remain on track to meet our full-year 2017 financial goals
3098,"For the quarter, while our reported results continue to be impacted by macro volatility and weak currencies, organic revenue was up more than 3% globally, a sequential acceleration from our growth rate in the first quarter"
3099,"We generated organic revenue growth across both developed and developing and emerging markets, with developed markets up 2% and D&E markets growing 6%"
3100,The portfolio generated strong net price realization and core constant currency operating profit grew 7%
3101,Core constant currency EPS grew 13%
3102,"Our results reflect the power and durability of our portfolio, its ability to deliver sustainable and well-balanced results, despite ongoing pockets of macro and geopolitical challenges in a number of our key markets around the globe, and in an increasingly dynamic retail and consumer environment"
3103,"Let's briefly review the performance in the quarter across our sectors, starting with North America where organic revenue grew 2% and core constant currency operating profit was up 4%"
3104,"Importantly, year to date through the second quarter, we have also generated more U.S"
3105,retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus manufacturers combined
3106,Frito-Lay North America had another very strong quarter
3107,"Volume and organic revenue accelerated sequentially from Q1, as we expected, and results reflected a very good balance of volume growth, net price realization and margin expansion"
3108,"We feel very good about the business, with innovation, pricing and execution, all on target"
3109,We are pleased to report that Frito-Lay alone was the number one contributor to total U.S
3110,"food and beverage retail growth by all $5 billion-plus manufacturers through the end of Q2. Similarly, North America Beverages grew organic revenue and core operating profit, but our growth rates were limited in part by adverse channel and subcategory mix in the quarter, as we have seen a lower rate of year-to-date growth in the C-store channel compared to last year and water growth outpace the balance of our business"
3111,"We are encouraged by continued strength in our [stills] portfolio with good growth in Gatorade, our total water portfolio which benefited from the strong introduction of LIFEWTR, Lipton, and our distribution of Rockstar"
3112,"In fact, in just five months of sales since its launch in Q1, LIFEWTR has already reached $70 million in retail sales across measured channels, was the top brand contributing to LRB retail sales growth of the second quarter, and is on track to generate approximately $200 million in retail sales on an annualized basis"
3113,"On the carbonated side, we are encouraged by the performance of Pepsi Zero Sugar, but have more work to do on the carbonated portfolio overall"
3114,We will also be allocating a bit more marketing behind the big sparkling brand in the second half
3115,"We have strong activation for this summer behind Pepsi Fire and our DEW-S-A program, followed by strong execution behind the NFL as we get to the fall"
3116,"As we execute our second half plans, we will remain very focused on driving better net price realization and letting our marketing and innovation drive the top line"
3117,"Quaker Foods North America performance continues to be impacted by broader center-of-stove pressures, but is performing well relative to other large breakfast manufacturers"
3118,"Going forward, we have powerful programming in place aimed to improve the trajectory of the business"
3119,"So for example, we have activation behind portable breakfast innovation, namely Breakfast Flats that we launched in 2016 and Breakfast Squares that were launched in the first quarter, and we have just launched a new and first-to-market Overnight Oats Cup in the second quarter to capitalize on the recent and growing consumer trend of preparing chilled oats using a variety of healthy ingredients"
3120,"Turning to our sectors outside North America, in Latin America we continue to see very challenging macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical instability, and high levels of inflation in key markets, including Brazil and Argentina, which are dampening consumer spending"
3121,"Within this context, our businesses are performing well"
3122,"Our largest market in the region, Mexico, encouragingly has been relatively stable and resilient and is performing well, and posted double-digit organic revenue growth in the second quarter"
3123,"While our core profit performance in the first half of the year was impacted by difficult economic conditions, we expect to see an improvement in core profit growth in the second half as we lap incremental investments from last year and we realize productivity from supply chain initiatives"
3124,"Similarly, we are experiencing macro challenges in a number of markets throughout our Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment, including the significant currency devaluation in Egypt and the economic impact in a number of markets across the Middle East stemming from persistently low oil prices"
3125,"Related to these, we are experiencing significant cost inflation in Egypt arising from adverse transaction Forex and we are dealing with the recently imposed carbonated soft drink tax in Saudi Arabia"
3126,So we are adjusting our business to address these challenges
3127,"We are pricing to cover the increased cost of doing business, we are going more aggressively after productivity to reduce our overall costs, and we continue to transform our beverage portfolio to offer more non-carbonated options and reducing sugar levels across the portfolio"
3128,"On the other hand, we are encouraged by a number of bright spots in the region, including China where we saw double-digit beverage organic revenue growth and mid single-digit snack organic revenue growth, in markets like Pakistan and Egypt where organic revenue was up double-digits"
3129,"And finally, turning to Europe and Sub-Sahara Africa, we had very good results across the region, with organic revenue growth in each of our major markets and a sequential acceleration overall"
3130,"Russia, our largest market in the region, had mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and very strong operating margin improvement"
3131,"As you saw in the release, our results also benefited from our sale of our minority stake in Britvic"
3132,"Even excluding this gain, core operating profit was up 19%"
3133,So we are very encouraged by the performance in the region and are optimistic about the outlook for the balance of the year
3134,We continue to manage what's in our control and our portfolio products and geographies is working
3135,"And so, with half the year behind us and our performance overall in line with our plans and expectations, we remain very much on track to deliver our full year financial target of at least 3% organic revenue growth and 8% core constant currency EPS growth"
3136,"And we continue to deliver these strong, reliable results even as our industry is undergoing some interesting shifts from multiple angles"
3137,"Consumer habits and behaviors continue to evolve, some trends like consumers' increasing demand for convenience and variety have been present for decades but are becoming more pronounced, consumer shopping habits are rapidly adapting to evolving and new retail formats, and their lifestyles are increasingly influenced by pervasive social and digital media and mobile technology, and this in turn requires new marketing models that harness the power of digital media and big data in a way that enables us to communicate with consumers on a much more personal and individualized level"
3138,Consumers are also seeking more value and benefits from what they purchase and consume
3139,"They are also seeking more premium experiences, and at the same time seeking value"
3140,"And across the spectrum, consumers continue to be interested in health and wellness, but with differing definitions, often not science-based of what this means"
3141,Perhaps more pronounced are the changes we are witnessing in retail where the lines are blurring between channels
3142,"Brick and mortar retailers are building deep e-commerce capability, pure-play e-commerce is moving into brick-and-mortar, and virtually every channel is melding aspects of grocery, convenience, foodservice, meal kits, prepared meals, and home delivery"
3143,"So with all this change occurring and at an accelerated pace, we could look upon the spirit in our industry with hesitation and pessimism or with a sense of excitement and optimism"
3144,We choose to take the optimistic approach because this period offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to strengthen our business and capture new avenues of growth
3145,We believe we are well-positioned to win in this environment
3146,"In fact, we anticipated and prepared for many of the trends we are witnessing today"
3147,"To begin, we participate in growing categories with products that are well-suited to consumers' continued desire for convenience, on-the-go portability, and snacking, in place of structured meals"
3148,"Many of our brands occupy the number one or number two spot in their respective categories, giving them the scale to cut through an increasingly cluttered and fragmented media landscape, especially in the digital realm"
3149,Our product portfolio has the stretch to continue to evolve with consumer needs
3150,We have the ability to innovate to provide new benefits and value to the consumer in ways that are not only consistent with the brand's equity but in many ways strengthen it
3151,A few examples come to mind
3152,"Lipton tea, over the years we have not only added more variety but we have strengthened the brand by introducing increasingly premium offerings, first with Pure Leaf and more recently with the Tea House Collection, resulting in the leading share position we enjoy today"
3153,"Or Mountain Dew, where over time we have expanded the trademark from traditional green-bottle Dew and Diet Dew to exciting line extensions like Code Red, White Out and Voltage, and our very successful Kickstart lineup"
3154,"Or Doritos, where our loyal consumers have embraced flavor extensions to the core product and innovations we have taken to foodservice and quick serve restaurants"
3155,"Or Quaker, where we have provided increasing portability and convenience to a hearty, healthy breakfast through the introduction of Breakfast Squares and Breakfast Flats"
3156,"Beyond our product advantages, we also have a well-balanced geographic footprint that enables us to weather pockets of macroeconomic volatility"
3157,"Importantly, we have extremely strong relationships with our retail partners and meaningful presence of scale across all our relevant channels"
3158,"In each of our five largest markets, comprising approximately 75% of our total net revenue, we are the largest or #2 food and beverage manufacturer based on retail sales"
3159,"Regardless of channel, our products and brands possess a number of important characteristics that make them highly appealing to our customers"
3160,"They are often purchased on impulse, which makes them highly incremental and therefore build basket and box size"
3161,"On promotion, they drive traffic"
3162,"They are highly complementary to other food and beverage purchases and they have high velocities, which makes them very productive in whatever shelf they occupy, and therefore they are big cash flow generators"
3163,These attributes translate to the very foundation of the value we bring to our customers regardless of channel
3164,We deliver sales growth and cash flow for our customers
3165,And our partnership with customers goes well beyond supplying great products
3166,"Our deep capabilities, enabled by our scale and years of extensive investment, allow us to work with a strategic partner, delivering value in the areas of supply chain management, consumer and shopper insight, social and digital consumer engagement, research and development, design, data analytics, and e-commerce"
3167,"In fact, our execution with retailers, leveraging the full breadth of our capabilities, deserves to be named the #1 best-in-class manufacturer in the most recent annual Kantar Retail PoweRanking survey in the United States, and this was further reinforced a few weeks ago when I attended the Consumer Goods Forum in Berlin"
3168,"In meeting after meeting with our retail partners from around the globe, they expressed how much they value the growth we generate for them"
3169,"And finally, one of the most compelling reasons for our optimism is our culture"
3170,"Over decades, we have built and developed a culture that thrives on change"
3171,"We have the heart of a challenger, a can-do spirit, with a must-do result"
3172,"We view the evolution of our business, that is products, supply chains, processes, organizations, or business models, as our natural state"
3173,Our business today is very different than it was five years ago and we expect it to be very different five years from now
3174,"Consider our beverage portfolio transformation that began decades ago when we had declared that we would become a total beverage company, and over the years we have built an enviable portfolio of leading brands across virtually every sub-segment of the beverage category, including Gatorade, Tropicana, Aquafina, Lipton, and Starbucks, through organic introductions, joint ventures and acquisitions"
3175,"And this transformation continues, as evidenced by our recent introductions of products like LIFEWTR, Lemon Lemon, and IZZE Fusions, and acquisition of KeVita"
3176,"By having continuing to evolve our supply-chain over the years, as the retail landscape has changed and new technologies have come to market"
3177,Our supply chain in Frito-Lay today is very different from the one we operated just a few years ago
3178,"For example, our deployment of GES has enabled us to handle more SKUs, fulfill demand with greater speed and accuracy, improve product quality and freshness, and operate more efficiently"
3179,"With our embrace of performance and purpose, the journey we embarked on more than 10 years ago that has transformed our business to adapt to the changing world around us"
3180,"We have reduced added sugars, saturated fat and sodium in many of our products, while continuing to expand our lineup of nutritious foods and beverages to meet growing consumer demand"
3181,Our product transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we now derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free
3182,"These products include diet and other beverages that contain 70 calories or less from added sugar per 12-ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat, as well as what we call 'everyday nutrition product'"
3183,"And a full 28 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as 'everyday nutrition', products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, protein, unsweetened tea, and water"
3184,"We have steadily improved our operational water use and energy efficiency, reducing our packaging and waste, and promoting responsible agricultural practices globally"
3185,We have built a workplace that attracts and retains the world's best and brightest
3186,And we intend to continue to make strides in these areas
3187,"We have announced even more aggressive product, planet and people goals that we intend to achieve by 2025. Net, we feel very good about where we stand"
3188,"We have a leading product portfolio, balanced development across channels and geographies, broad capabilities, a robust productivity agenda, a great corporate culture, and excellent talents"
3189,"These factors and combinations have enabled us to continue to deliver an attractive balance of top line and bottom line growth, and they give us the confidence to lead into an ever-changing environment with a sense of excitement and cautious optimism"
3190,"With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh"
3191,"That was 10 questions, Dara"
3192,"That was 10 questions very wonderfully rolled into one, but we're going to try to answer every one of those"
3193,"Let me start by saying that I think you are beginning to see the limitations of the syndicated data, because as I mentioned in my script, the channels are beginning to blur between food service, retail, home delivery, restaurants, everything, the channels are beginning to blur"
3194,"And when you have blurring channels, you now have a shopping occasion being replaced by home delivery or replaced by a meal delivery of kits"
3195,"So what we have to do is rethink what is the real growth of the marketplace, the food and beverage marketplace, in a much more holistic way"
3196,There's no question that the syndicated data showed a slowdown in the overall market I'd say in the first half
3197,"Rather than talk about quarter to quarter, let's just talk about the first half"
3198,Slightly south of 2% is what we saw in the first half
3199,"But I think if you include a much broader definition of the market, I think you're going to see what the traditional growth is, which is population plus some, more in the range of somewhere between 2% and 2.5%"
3200,I think that's what you'll see as an overall growth rate
3201,I think we all as manufacturers have to start to rethink how we serve this multiplicity of channels and how we should retool our business models to serve every one of these fragmenting channels
3202,"That's the challenge all of us have and we have been looking at that very, very carefully"
3203,Now let's talk a little bit about the category weakness
3204,"I think, on salty snacks in particular, let me speak to that"
3205,"I have belief, and we watch volume, revenue and pricing very, very carefully on a weekly basis, I think where the market is today, when we can take pricing, we should take the pricing, and we have been trying to move the portfolio more to premium products, and the good news is that we are actually making progress in Frito-Lay to move the business more to premium products"
3206,"And so, I'd say, this thing will right itself, we are gaining share overall in the marketplace, we are gaining value share which is really what we are focused on, we are managing the mix very carefully, managing channel mix, product mix very carefully"
3207,"We feel pretty good about the Frito-Lay performance and where we are moving the portfolio, nudging it towards premium, balancing the value of mainstream part of the portfolio very, very carefully"
3208,So we feel good about that
3209,"On the beverage side, we've got good price realization, so I feel good about that"
3210,"Do I have some concerns about our carbonated soft drink business? Not concerns, but I think they have more opportunity, and I think that as we move towards the second half of the year and we sort of fine-tune our calendar, you'll start seeing more activity from us on carbonated soft drinks"
3211,"On balance, we have good innovation, and I wouldn't say we are concerned, but we are watching it very, very carefully to make sure that everything that we can control, we do right by these businesses"
3212,"Big businesses, very attractive businesses, we just want to make sure we get our fair share of those businesses"
3213,But the key thing is we are going to focus on price realization and let marketing drive the top line
3214,And it's a great tasting product
3215,"So, I'm going to let Hugh get all the answers ready for the 10 questions you asked in operating margin, Ali"
3216,Let me talk about the changes in channels
3217,We are all figuring it out as we go along
3218,"The good news is, our e-commerce business is growing brilliantly"
3219,"We are doing very, very well"
3220,We are not yet ready to talk about it in any significant way
3221,Maybe in the next couple of calls we will start focusing on that
3222,"But it's growing really, really nicely"
3223,"But it's growing with our traditional products and our traditional packaging, if you want to call it that"
3224,"There is clearly an opportunity for us to think about innovation for e-commerce, which is what we are all focused on"
3225,"We want to make sure that our snacks are more shippable, not just in click and collect, but more also for delivery, so that the cube efficiency is there"
3226,"And on beverages, I think there are two issues"
3227,"One is the cold delivery of the beverages, if consumers so desire ice-cold beverages delivered to them, which I find it hard to believe, but you can never tell"
3228,"And then how do we make sure that we address this whole delivery of water, because beverages is largely water"
3229,"So we are looking at meaningful innovation, both in snacks and beverages, in order to address the exploding growth of e-commerce"
3230,"And with our big brands, I think we are well-positioned"
3231,Now let me come to the impulse nature of our products
3232,"I think the whole e-commerce area is going to be impulse as you see it in a brick-and-mortar store, which then translates to e-commerce and then becomes part of a replenishment cycle"
3233,"But then as people stop going to brick-and-mortar and start shopping only on e-commerce, which well could be the Gen-Z, the new I-generation, if you want to call it that, I think the new digital tools can easily afford you the ability to create the impulse experience online"
3234,"We have seen so many virtual reality tools right now that can actually simulate grocery stores or whatever version of a grocery store you want online, and you can easily navigate the aisles and just with a click shop for whatever you want"
3235,"So, I think in an interesting way there's infinite possibilities to create impulse all through technology online, and I think as this market matures and evolves, you're going to see a lot of that happening, and we are focused on developing all of these tools ourselves with our e-commerce partners to make sure that we are responsive to them when they so choose to go that way"
3236,"So with that, let me turn it to Hugh to give you the [treaties] [ph] on operating margin"
3237,"And I think, Hugh, it's fair to say that with the changing marketplace, where there's blurring of retail channels, the consumer preferences changing, the marketing models changing, we have to invest in these new capabilities in order to generate the top line growth we are generating"
3238,"So, we intend to continue to invest judiciously in these new areas, so we can sustain our top line growth globally"
3239,"We model out different channel shifts, what could be the pricing implications, we look at analogs from Europe when there were lots of retail disruptions, and then we look at what do we need to do to get innovation-driven pricing, mix-driven pricing, and then what do we need to offset the productivity, how do we need to go deeper on productivity programs"
3240,"So Bryan, what we do do is model this out constantly, we look at multiple scenarios, and then we figure out how to get the best blend of top and bottom line growth in a changing retail environment"
3241,"The good news is that as the retail environment shifts, we just have to retool our model for the retail environment shifts"
3242,"The market is still growing, that's the good news, and these are huge categories"
3243,"So, our goal is to capture the growth with a changing environment with our innovation and our big brands"
3244,"That's why we focus so much on innovation because we believe innovation can actually create consumer demand and get us the price premium, and then we keep investing in our brands, both at the big brand level and the emerging brands like KeVita and Naked, so that we can grow our business on both ends of the spectrum"
3245,"I don't know about harder, they are different"
3246,"I think it's different buckets, different areas, some areas that we are comfortable with, some areas where we have to develop new muscle, but that's part of life in our food and beverage industry"
3247,I've been in PepsiCo for 23 years and every five years or so there is a brand-new skill we have to develop
3248,"And this place is amazingly resilient, we develop the muscle, we hire from the outside when we have to, we retrain, and then we go on"
3249,"So, I wouldn't say it's getting harder, I'd just say that it's different buckets and we have to put in the work to make sure that we can deliver growth in this new environment"
3250,"As I said in response to an earlier question, we are looking at how much productivity we need to deliver to offset any price inflation if it happens because of retail disruption"
3251,"So, we are constantly looking at how we need to balance top line and bottom line growth, and clearly productivity is a major factor in bottom line growth delivery"
3252,So we are looking at that
3253,"Hugh, did you want to add anything to that point?"
3254,And I think a lot of the new technologies actually allow us to deliver more productivity
3255,"We just need to – I think the key thing people have to take away is that in order to deliver productivity downstream, you have to invest upstream"
3256,So you have to invest today to get the benefits tomorrow
3257,Benefits don't come out of thin air
3258,"And so, what we are doing is investing today to get more productivity downstream"
3259,"So, first of all, we don't lose the Lipton business even with change of hands"
3260,So I would rest assure that we are protected there
3261,"On this whole industry outlook, Pablo, I think you guys on the sell side are much more knowledgeable about industry and industry trends, because you've been following it for such a long time"
3262,We actually read your reports to get insights into where you think the industry is going
3263,So I'd rather depend on your opinions here and we'll keep our opinions to ourselves on this one
3264,Thanks Lauren for the question
3265,"First of all, we don't reconcile our data with the scanner data"
3266,"We just keep running the business and just we keep selling, we keep making sure that our product is on the shelf"
3267,"Remember, we are high velocity products"
3268,"So, we know on a weekly basis exactly what we sell and what's being pulled by the consumer"
3269,So we have good data on what's happening in the marketplace
3270,I have no idea why the scanner data diverges so much
3271,"It's been happening in many markets and I think it reflects some of the limitations of syndicated data and they need to go back and retool it, but we are very comfortable where we are and we are just going to keep running the business this way"
3272,"So with that, let me thank you for your questions, and to summarize, we are pleased with our results for the first half, we remain on track to deliver our full-year financial targets, and we feel well-positioned to continue to perform well, even in the midst of change and disruption"
3273,Thank you very much for joining us this morning and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment
3274,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning everyone"
3275,Kroger’s market share grew for the twelfth year in a row
3276,Our consistent market share gains drive both top and bottom line growth and generate blasting shareholder value
3277,We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it where they spend the money
3278,"According to Nielsen Plus data, Kroger’s overall market share with the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points in 2016 with 14 of 22 markets up too flat and six markets down"
3279,"Starting in 2017, we plan to begin using IRI point of sale data to measure market share"
3280,"While we expect there to be some differences in share reporting between Nielsen and IRI, we expect those differences to be minimal"
3281,"Regardless of the source, we use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one"
3282,It is also worth noting that market share data is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales
3283,"Looking at ID sales, deflation was the primary driver of our negative results for the quarter"
3284,Inflation adjusted ID sales were positive in the fourth quarter
3285,Deflation excluding fuel persisted at 1.3% compared to 1.1% in the third quarter
3286,"During the quarter, we saw decline in pharmacy inflation and acceleration in produce deflation and a slowing in grocer deflation"
3287,Another headwind to ID sales was our capital program
3288,"Over the last four quarters, we relocated or expanded 35 strong performing stores taking them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation"
3289,This caused about 70 basis point headwind to ID sales in the fourth quarter
3290,Tonnage was positive during the fourth quarter and we continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products which by the way hit nearly $16 billion in sales in 2016 in areas where we are saving customers time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions
3291,We always give a little insight into our ID sales data
3292,Visits per household and price per unit were down in the fourth quarter but those were slightly offset by basket size and household growth
3293,Loyal households continue to grow at a faster rate than total households which was true for both the quarter and the year
3294,It is interesting to note that loyal household had slightly positive ID growth in the fourth quarter
3295,"Operating, general and administrative costs as a rate of sales excluding fuel, recent mergers, and a $30 million contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2015 declined by 11 basis points; rent and depreciation with the same exclusions increased by 24 basis points"
3296,"While this result was better than the third quarter, we can and will do better"
3297,We are working diligently to pull costs out of the business and improve processes to lower cost as a rate of sales and deliver value to customers
3298,"Now, for an update on retail fuel, in the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.172 compared to $0.169 in the same quarter last year"
3299,The average retail price of fuel was $0.0218 versus $0.0192 in the same quarter last year
3300,"For 2016 in total, we are at $0.171 for the year and $0.174 in 2015. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.31 times compared to 2.08 times during the same period last year"
3301,This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and increases in working capital
3302,The increase in working capital is driven by higher inventory in four locations where we open new or expanded distribution centers
3303,"When doing this, we duplicate inventory for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition"
3304,"Also, accrued liabilities are lower due to lower incentive plan payout accruals"
3305,This fortune will reverse in the first quarter when incentive plan cash payments will be lower
3306,"It is worth noting that over longer time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow"
3307,This is because we continue to work with our unions to modify pension plans
3308,We continue to negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits as we did in the second quarter
3309,These restructurings do not change the total obligations of the company because the debt we add is offset by a reduction in the amount of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations
3310,"In 2016, Kroger used cash to repurchase $1.8 million in common shares, paid $429 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and to merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million"
3311,"Capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities total $3.6 billion for the year compared to $3.5 billion last year"
3312,The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy
3313,Return on invested capital for 2016 was 13.09%
3314,This result was affected by current year results and recently merged companies
3315,We are committed to growing return on invested capital with the long term
3316,I will now provide a brief update on labor relations
3317,We recently agreed to a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy’s distribution center and with the UFCW for North Carolina clerks and meat associates
3318,"We are currently negotiating contracts covering store associates in Atlanta, and Michigan"
3319,"Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefit for our associates"
3320,Kroger’s financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs with some of our competitors do not face
3321,"Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates with importance of growing Kroger's business and doing it profitably, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates"
3322,"Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we anticipate identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to range from flat to 1% growth for 2017. We expect net earnings to range from $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.09 benefit for the 53rd week"
3323,We anticipate the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar to the second half of 2016. Our results in the second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle to previous year
3324,We recognize that this is an unusual year and that’s why we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compared to our long-term guidance rate as we’ve done in the past
3325,"In fact for the first quarter, we are going to give you an earnings per share range, which is not something we plan to do over the long-term, but we think it’s important to be very clear about how we think the year is going to progress"
3326,"For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the first quarter to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range, the second quarter to be slightly up compared to last year, the third quarter to be up strongly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be up high-single digits compared to last year without the benefit of the 53rd week"
3327,"Our guidance for the year excludes the estimated cost of the voluntary retirement offer, but does include the anticipated expense savings, which we will reinvest in the business"
3328,Over the long-term we are committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend
3329,We expect a LIFO charge of $25 million for the year
3330,"We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Capital expenditures in 2017 will be focused on sales generating initiatives, remodels, upgrades to our logistics network and merchandising systems and digital and technology initiatives"
3331,"As we invest more in these areas, our investment in stores will be reduced"
3332,"As we anticipate Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2017, excluding fuel, to decline approximately 10 basis points compared to 2016 results"
3333,"Now, I will turn it back to Rodney"
3334,"Sure, John"
3335,"As I’ve said in the prepared remarks, we do expect the first half of the year to be much like how 2016 ended and it's really just carrying the current trends out through the first – as you know this is a 16-week quarter for us – through those first 16 weeks of the year"
3336,And we see the clarity to some of the programs Rodney mentioned and the fact that we continue to drive unit growth
3337,We do expect to see the recovery in the sales later in the year
3338,"John Heinbockel Okay, thank you"
3339,No
3340,"As I said in the prepared remarks, as we finalize what the expense of that will be, that will be reflective in the first quarter"
3341,The offer is not entirely close so we won’t know until next week exactly how many people ultimately accepted the offer
3342,And there will be varying times when people ultimately retire so that does go throughout the year as those folks ultimately retire
3343,Do keep in mind as I said in prepared remarks was we do not have the expense of the plan in our estimates
3344,We do have the savings in their plan and/or a portion of what we plan to invest to increase the value proposition for our customers
3345,We did not give any specific guidance on the level of buyback we’ll do and obviously it depended on market conditions as well as our Board being willing to give us incremental authorization
3346,We will run out of our existing authorization here in the very near term
3347,We’ve been buying shares since late last year and all through so far this year off of the greatest average 10b5-1. So we’re somewhat predicated and our Board given this incremental authority
3348,I can tell you there were lot of efforts we have underway to reduce our total cost of doing business and it’s in a variety of areas
3349,"We can do better on shrink, we can do better on store productivity in some areas, we can certainly do better on in stock in some areas"
3350,"And one of the great things about being in a company of this size and breadth of Kroger is, there is not an initiative we have out there that we don’t already have, a very large group of stores achieving"
3351,We don’t have to go outside the company and point to competitor actually doing this so we are
3352,"Every metric we have out there for our storage to do better on, we already have a group of stores achieving those results, and as we get better at achieving those over a broader base of stores, that’s one of the things that we think is going to give us incremental fuel for the engine to continue to invest in the four piece"
3353,"Thanks, Karen"
3354,I think you’re doing what a lot of people do including this morning when I was on CNBC of mixing inflation and deflation at cost and retail
3355,When we talk about our inflation or deflation it’s our product cost inflation or deflation
3356,You kind of through and what’s going to happen to retail product cost inflation or deflation
3357,"And overall, we do think that we will return to a slightly inflationary environment in the back half of the year"
3358,"It is interesting to note that despite the fact that we pretty much add, I think Rodney was talking before with one of the callers, nine quarters in a row of deflation, declining inflation/deflation"
3359,"I’ll be there inflation coming down or actual deflation, it’s nine straight quarters now but that trend volume would be down"
3360,So it’s been obviously fairly persistent
3361,"Despite that, even though we had a lot lower pharmacy inflation in the quarter that still generated a very large LIFO charge, it was offset by other areas that had deflation"
3362,So it’s a completely mixed bag
3363,"Even in the fourth quarter, grocery inflation over the course of the quarter was basically half of what it was in the third quarter but produce inflation went up 600 basis points or deflation expanded by 600 basis points, and that was over 7% deflation in the quarter"
3364,"So it’s a huge mixed bag of what’s out there and I’m not going to pinpoint an exact number because I’ve proven over the years that I can predict a totally inaccurate number on inflation or even LIFO, but we continue to manage through the process that we have"
3365,"The promotions by category, we would use our 8451 insights for that and it would really be different by customer, some of it would be things that you would do personalized one-on-one"
3366,"So, it actually – if you go into the store from checking the retail price you wouldn't see it because of its offers that are made directly to customers, sums via coupons"
3367,"It's all the above because different customers react different ways to different promotions, so it’s becoming increasingly personalized offers based on what that particular customer wants and desires are"
3368,"And it would be a mix of national brand, corporate brands and fresh product and others, so it's really a mix on the comp by quarter"
3369,"Mike, I will let you…"
3370,"Yeah, if you to repeat your question, I want to make sure I’m answering the question you are asking, not what I have in head"
3371,"Well the comment about we expect the first quarter to look a lot like the first quarter, I guess, would be a little bit of coat for ID sales continue to be a little bit negative right now, which means we expect ID sales to recover as we go throughout the year"
3372,And that's going back to the questions that we've gotten on the cadence of how we expect to see the underlying EPS is that is predicated on an improvement in ID sales throughout the year
3373,Is what it typically is
3374,"And when you look at the number of stores we did over the last year compared to two or three years ago, it’s about double, major store projects"
3375,"Well, as those stores are open long enough they will flip back into our ID store base"
3376,And we would hope they continue to perform the way they are in the tailwind ID sales
3377,"And as I’ve said in the prepared comments, we are taking capital down from what we would originally plan to spend in 2017 because we've been guiding folks to think about 2017 and even 2018 to be a similar spend level that we did 2016 and most of that will come out of new store"
3378,"And we will continue a strong remodel program, so when we remodel a store, it does not come out of IDs, it's only an expansion or relocation or a net new that winds up affecting it"
3379,"I think it will continue for a while, but it will decline over time as those stores become identical again"
3380,"And if you look at the prior year, we didn't have much weather either and in fact the only one big weather event we had was the last weekend of the year in last year's numbers"
3381,So our year ended against the only weather event we had in the prior year with no weather this year
3382,"Robby, I would be in Rodney's boat from an insight standpoint"
3383,"My conclusion, without meeting with some other folks and having conversation, would be that the timing of those doesn't affect us in a big way like it does other folks because over my time here at Kroger I've never heard anybody talk about I can't wait till tax refunds drop so we can get a boost in sales"
3384,So it just doesn't – I agree with what Rodney's conclusion is based on most of what we sell
3385,But those are all great big Fred Meyer stores with a lot of general merchandise
3386,"So if you look at the – if you look at Roundy's overall, we continue to be very happy with what Michael Marks and team were doing in Wisconsin as well as Don Rosanova and team in Chicagoland with the two banners"
3387,Mike and team have cycled through the first set of store remodels and offerings to the customers who are now in second market getting remodels completed and then we'll put a full campaign in that market
3388,"And then if we continue to see the positive reaction from the customers from ID sales dollars and units, we’d expect to continue to roll that out throughout the state"
3389,"From an ID stand sales standpoint, it really didn't affect it very much in the quarter certainly not as much as it did earlier in the year"
3390,We have time for one more question
3391,And different category reinventions with coffee and pet and baby where we’ve totally redone to look and feel those departments for our customer
3392,"Thanks, Fareed, and good morning everyone"
3393,"As the chart on slide 10 shows, Kellogg North America saw sequential improvement in our performance for net sales, operating profit and for operating profit margin"
3394,"A few things to point out, each of which I'll describe in more detail in a moment"
3395,"First, we're seeing growth or improving sales performance in businesses ranging from Specialty Channels to Frozen Foods, to the Kashi Company to Canada"
3396,"Second, an area of disappointment in the quarter was Morning Foods top-line performance"
3397,"Like so many categories for cereal and toaster pastry categories, we haven't returned to last year's rates"
3398,"It's incumbent on us to drive these categories, and we have stronger plans coming in the second half"
3399,"Third, we feel very good about our transition into warehouse and out of DSD, which is nearly complete"
3400,We are right on track on this big step towards the transformation of U.S
3401,Snacks
3402,"And finally, we continue to realize good margin expansion"
3403,It's driven by productivity and it has us on track for our 2018 targets
3404,But I want to emphasize something
3405,We are mindful of ensuring that these productivity efforts don't in any way inhibit our return to growth
3406,"So, now let's briefly walk through each of our North America segments"
3407,We'll start with U.S
3408,"Snacks and our update on our DSD transition on slide 11. As I mentioned, this transition has gone very well"
3409,We are now entering the final wind-down phase
3410,It's important to recognize what is now behind us
3411,We've completed all customer negotiations
3412,"This means we know the list price adjustment to customers, and we have been developing joint business plans with them"
3413,We finalized our SKU rationalizations
3414,So we know the shelf assortment
3415,"We've started reducing complexity in our supply chain, and we started to make the store shelf work harder for us and for our customers"
3416,"As of this week, we are 100% out of DSD"
3417,"That is, we are receiving orders from customers and we are shipping to all customers warehouses"
3418,"It's early days, but where we have customer data, we are already seeing improved on-shelf availability"
3419,"We've now entered the final phase of the project, completing the exit"
3420,"Not only are we now closing the distribution centers, but we are also in hyper-care mode, in which we devote resources to stores in order to ensure that everything, from ordering to shelf tagging, to shipments, are operating smoothly"
3421,This is important because it's also the time when we are pivoting our teams' focus to driving top-line growth
3422,"We are ramping up our brand-building and in-store activation, and we're planning and executing jointly with our customers, all to ensure we start growing demand"
3423,"We are obviously pleased with how this is going on all fronts, from the strong engagement and collaboration of our customers, to the attention to detail of our project team, to the positive attitude of our sales force and supply chain"
3424,And we really want to thank all of them for their dedication and focus on execution during this challenging transition
3425,"Obviously, we're taking on a very complex change initiative, one that could present executional risk and/or competitive risk at any time, but the team is managing it very well, and our full-year outlook for this transition has not changed"
3426,"Now, let's talk about Snacks results for the quarter, which is shown on slide number 12. Net sales were flat in the quarter, reflecting two factors related to the DSD transition"
3427,"Firstly, there was the positive impact of inventory pipeline fill"
3428,This is the shipping of inventory into our customers' warehouses as we convert them from DSD to warehouse distribution
3429,This began in the latter half of Q2 and ramped up in early Q3 as we converted the remaining customers
3430,"Secondly, in-store promotion activity was reduced, as you can see in the scanner data, not only in the sharp declines in volume sold on promotion, but also in our sizable increases in average prices"
3431,"As you would expect, this pullback was driven by a combination of us and our customers wanting to mitigate big shipment swings as we produce and ship inventory for their warehouses"
3432,"With us now fully in warehouse distribution, we strengthen our promotional calendar in the second half"
3433,This reduced promo activity is masking some good underlying trends
3434,"Our Big 3 cracker brands held share, despite the reduced activity"
3435,"Keebler Fudge Shoppe maintained consumption and share growth in cookies, and Rice Krispies Treats sustained its momentum in wholesome snacks"
3436,"Importantly, we started up our accelerated investment in brand-building during the quarter as we transition to a pull model"
3437,"This, along with some duplicative costs as we resourced up our warehouse distribution, held down profit in the quarter"
3438,"But this profit came in as we'd expected, and the increased brand-building bodes well for consumption performance in the second half"
3439,So Snacks is in a good place
3440,"The DSD transition is right where we'd expected it to be, and we are now turning to a pull model that will help transform this business"
3441,"It's worth reminding everyone that this transition starts with a reduction in net sales, due to the price we set to customers, a reduction in SKUs and somewhat lower secondary and tertiary displays, so net sales come down for 12 months before they start growing again"
3442,"On the flipside, our operating profit and operating margins start to move higher right away and especially in Q4, when we completely eliminate our DSD expenses"
3443,That's even despite the sizable reinvestments we're making
3444,"All of this is already in our guidance, and I think you'll agree that we'll come out of this with a faster growing, more profitable U.S"
3445,Snacks business
3446,"Now, let's turn to slide 13 on U.S"
3447,Morning Foods
3448,"Whilst we're pleased with our great progress on margin expansion, we are not happy about our top-line performance in this segment"
3449,"Our Core 6 cereal brands collectively held share in the quarter, but the cereal category remained softer than expected"
3450,"Whilst there are a variety of industry-wide trends that we can point to, it's our job to drive this category through great commercial ideas, across major brands"
3451,"To that then, we expect to see sequential improvement in the second half, and here's why"
3452,"One, we will continue to support our taste-oriented brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, which continue to gain share behind effective media and innovation, respectively"
3453,"In fact, Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the number one innovation this year across the entire category"
3454,"Two, Special K was down year-on-year, but it improved sequentially and even returned to share growth in June, behind innovation and our new Own It campaign"
3455,This is a promising sign going into the second half
3456,"And three, we have better in-store program in the second half"
3457,This includes stronger seasonal innovation and strong Back-to-School programs
3458,"Looking beyond 2017, we've got to think bigger"
3459,"Once we're happy with the performance of our taste brands, we know we have to do more to reassert this category's health and wellness credentials"
3460,It's the adult health-oriented segment that is pulling down the category
3461,"And the way to reinvigorate that segment has always been through nutritional innovation claims and brand-building, so that's where we're focusing our efforts"
3462,An example of this is on the slide
3463,"Late this year, we'll be launching a new Special K Nourish offering, featuring probiotics"
3464,"We'll have more to share with you as we get closer to 2018. Now let's talk about Specialty Channels, shown on slide number 14. Our Specialty Channels business in Q2 delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth"
3465,"We generated growth in our three core channels, in which we already have leading positions, foodservice, convenience stores and vending"
3466,"In foodservice, our growth was again led by the K-12 segment"
3467,"And in C-stores and vending, our growth was aided by innovation"
3468,"Importantly, in Q2, we implemented a transformation of our sales force to a hybrid direct and broker mode"
3469,"This is expected to drive stronger focus on our core accounts, whilst expanding our market coverage by almost 40% across foodservice and convenience channels"
3470,"Operating profit margin continued to improve strongly, driven by better price/mix and by continued savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting"
3471,So we continue to feel good about our Specialty Channels business
3472,"And growth should continue in the second half, even despite tough comparisons"
3473,"Finally, we'll turn to slide number 15 and our North America Other segment"
3474,"As we said would happen, we are solidly in profit growth for this segment"
3475,Q2 was a third straight quarter of strong operating profit performance
3476,But just as important is the fact that we also realized good sequential improvement in net sales
3477,"At the Kashi Company, sales remained pressured by last year's exiting of non-core or less profitable SKUs, promotions and categories"
3478,"But we're going to be lapping those soon, and the quarter offered promising signs of what's to come"
3479,We realized another quarter of share gains in cereal and xAOC channels as well as in the natural channel
3480,"And we saw markedly improved trends in these channels through our Wholesome Snacks business, as recent innovations and media are starting to take hold"
3481,"We are turning the corner on this business, and we are confident we'll continue to see sequential improvement in top-line in the second half"
3482,"In Canada, we also continue to see improving results"
3483,Recall that we have been feeling the elasticity impact from our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover FX-driven input cost inflation
3484,"We started to lap some of that, and our net sales and consumption have continued to improve"
3485,"During Q2, our consumption declines in cereal moderated significantly"
3486,"Our base consumption was again very strong, and we increased share as a result"
3487,"In Wholesome Snacks, we gained share, too, also behind strong base consumption"
3488,And our Pringles business grew consumption and share as well
3489,So Canada is on the right track to meet expectations for the year
3490,"In Frozen, Eggo grew consumption and share, aided by the removal of artificial ingredients and the launch of kid-loved shapes, with Mickey Mouse-shaped waffles leading the way"
3491,"Our frozen veggie business under MorningStar Farms and the Gardenburger brands added another quarter to its return to consumption growth, thanks to a focus on core burger offerings"
3492,So Frozen is back in growth and picking up momentum
3493,"So to wrap up North America, Snacks came in as expected, with terrific progress on the DSD transition"
3494,Specialty Channels continues to grow
3495,And North America Other is turning the corner
3496,"Morning Foods remains soft, so we have to redouble our efforts to get the cereal category growing again, but the net of all of this is sequential improvement on top of sustained margin expansion"
3497,"With that, I'll turn you back to John for a look at our international regions"
3498,"Hey, Matthew, I'd just tell you it's gone and is going very well"
3499,We had great customer engagement
3500,We have a great assortment
3501,"And we were proactive, as you probably are aware, in managing that assortment, from an SKU reduction point of view, but also with a focus on making our biggest brands and our bigger SKUs work harder within that assortment"
3502,"So as SKUs come out, we gain space on our faster, harder-working SKUs"
3503,The pricing negotiations are all behind us
3504,"For competitive reasons and obviously other reasons, I'm not going to go into those, but those will flow through our P&L as we go forward"
3505,And there's been strong collaboration between our teams internally and our customer teams internally right all the way through this
3506,We're out of DSD
3507,We're 100% shipping through warehouses
3508,"Our focus has pivoted to really the in-store environment right now, making sure that the ordering processes are working, the shelf hands are where they need to be, helping educate store-level employees on doing the job that we used to do"
3509,"And through the data we're seeing come through in the customers we can see already, we're seeing in-stock's up, which is positive"
3510,The internal center of gravity is now very much in Deanie's team around contributing to growth
3511,So we're executing against our pull model
3512,Brand-building will be up significantly in the back half
3513,Our promotional pressure comes back now in the back half following the pullback in Q2 to manage the transition
3514,"So you can expect good Back-to-School programs, fall football programs, holiday programs and the strengthening of our relation pipeline coming into 2018. Our team's done a great job and the financials are exactly where we thought they would be and on track for the year to come"
3515,I'll take that and maybe Fareed might want talk about how it lays down for the year
3516,"But again, everything's on track and really where we thought it would be, so there's, I wouldn't say, we're necessarily ahead"
3517,There has been some impact obviously in the business through Q2 and we would expect to see some of that through the rest of the year
3518,"The impacts, so far year-to-date, are really two"
3519,"We saw some inventory come in, in Q2. And that was probably about 5% that contributed to our performance in Q2, offset by emerging merchandising pullback and some of the price adjustments coming through"
3520,So those two things mostly offset each other
3521,"As we pivot to the back half of the year, you will see a little more inventory come in in Q3. And also Q3 has July in it, so there's been a little bit more disruption, a merchandising pullback as we go through the execution"
3522,"Then, as we said and I said in the prepared notes, we will see a drop off in net sales because of the price decline and the transfer of work as we go forward, and that would impact the P&L as we go forward"
3523,"Down the P&L, we will see the costs of the DSD organization collapse as we go through that and really fluctuate with full force for Q4 this year"
3524,"Does that answer your question, Chris?"
3525,"Ken, let me take it up a level"
3526,"If you look at the category, the history of that category, there have been cycles over the years that have driven the category"
3527,"Those cycles are often related to health and wellness, positively and, many times, negatively"
3528,The whole fiber oat brand booms of prior years drove the category
3529,"Well frankly, through the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, low-calorie, low-fat and weight management really drove the category"
3530,And no brands rode the category harder in those years than Special K
3531,"As we get through to 2010 and into the recent years, low-calorie, low-fat has come off trend and we have obviously been impacted significantly by that"
3532,"What encourages me as I look forward and where science and nutrition is going, where the trends are, clearly what is big and right in front of us now and I think will be really important is gut health and the gut-brain connection, the importance of the microbiome and the importance of fiber coming back into people's diets, either prebiotic or probiotic benefits"
3533,"Those things, considering nine out of 10 Americans don't get enough fiber today, I think are going to position our category extremely well to grow as we go forward"
3534,"So the tailwind is coming back, in my opinion, following a short period here of headwind"
3535,"For us, we need to reassert our credentials in these areas"
3536,"So we'll do the hygiene work we're already doing, removing artificials, et cetera, but the big wins will come from upping our claims on existing brands like Raisin Bran, Mini-Wheats, around fiber and the importance of fiber and then, driving innovation into our adult brands, things like Special K with probiotics, et cetera, as we go forward"
3537,"So that's how the health and wellness piece, for me, is encouraging and gives me belief that we can get this category back with a tailwind behind it"
3538,"The other thing that's important, quite frankly, is how people eat today"
3539,"And as you probably heard us talk before, 35-plus percent of cereal there is consumed outside of breakfast occasion"
3540,"And in repositioning the category, it's a big word, to be more of an all-day food and an all-day snack to be consumed whenever you want, is, I think, critical to how we open up growth potential for the category, whether that's driving brands or Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes or Rice Krispies throughout the day through a recipe or consumption opportunity or whether it's bringing innovation in the area of convenience and affordability to the cereal category to unlock those opportunities throughout the day"
3541,"And then last, and also important is, we got to keep the pressure on fun and taste in this category, which has always been an important part of what drives the heartbeat of the performance of the category"
3542,"If I look today, the pressure on fun and taste is fine"
3543,"The other two, we can do more"
3544,"So big question; the reason we originally did this was a consumer shelf-driven strategic decision, given how, when you look at the food business and the retail business, how the shopper's shopping is changing so much"
3545,"So the focus was to shift our resources away from what we consider for our business, at least, to be a demoted route to market and get our resources against the shopper, the brand-building resources we need in this changing environment that the shopper shops in"
3546,"Talking top-to-top with our largest customers, they all see the benefits of moving in that direction because most of our customers are moving into a click-and-collect world"
3547,Our click-and-collect for our overall e-commerce business is actually doing extremely well
3548,"It's growing in the second quarter, up 70%-plus"
3549,So we're doing very well and that's total e-comm
3550,"So we need to feed that trend as we go forward by moving more of our resources, marketing dollars, people dollars, against where that world is going to be, not just e-commerce, but also the smaller format environments that are growing as well"
3551,We have a great warehouse system
3552,Our customers have great warehouse systems
3553,"75% of what we make as a company in North America already goes through a warehouse system, and we know we get better service and higher in-stocks in a warehouse system"
3554,"So when we go to one delivered system to all of our retail partners, not just certain ones versus other ones, I can have a better deal-value-creation conversation about one platform delivered, shared efficiencies, scale benefits from the Kellogg Company that could help both us and them in what, let's face it, is a changing retail environment where they need to pivot some of their cost of investment against changing their model just to meet where the shopper shops"
3555,So I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for
3556,It was about a big strategic move to get ahead of the shopper is why we did it
3557,"Every customer's different, to be honest"
3558,"And that's not trying to skirt around the question, but some of the earlier customers, we proactively culled SKUs with the aim of strengthening our assortment to get a harder-working assortment behind our biggest brands"
3559,"With some customers, we're gaining space on the shelf"
3560,"Some customers, we're giving up space because of items we're deleting simplify everything, quite frankly, through the process"
3561,"And then, we're regaining space behind those deletions around our biggest brands like Cheez-It or Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera"
3562,So it is a customer-by-customer picture
3563,"The aim of this, though, David, is to get a harder working portfolio"
3564,"And remember, in a DSD world relative to a warehouse world, the customer margin in the warehouse world is higher than in a DSD world"
3565,"So you have big mega brands with big brand-building investment, promotional pressure, there's a real incentive for the win-win here to drive these brands harder going forward"
3566,July will be the same because we're still transitioning through July
3567,"So July, we don't expect any difference"
3568,Our ramping up of programming really comes in in August
3569,That will be offset by obviously inside the P&L
3570,"So, Nielsen data, you'll see some improvement"
3571,In the P&L you'll see the impact of the net sales
3572,"As for the commitment we made in the past to put margins up to the norm, that commitment still stands"
3573,"Hey, Jonathan"
3574,"Internally, we talk, focused very much on what we call the Core 6. There are six brands, which are our Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Rice Krispies, Special K, Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran, plus one or two, which is Kashi, on account of the Kashi Company"
3575,Those brands cover the broad spectrum of needs in the cereal category
3576,"And so for the fundamentals of the category to work well, you have to have, we say, you've got to be firing on all cylinders across those six brands"
3577,That is innovation
3578,That is renovation
3579,That is great ideas
3580,And that is excellence when it comes to in-store execution and leveraging the scale of those brands across our retail base
3581,And so that's very much what we focus on
3582,So what you said is where we're going or what we're doing
3583,"As I mentioned, there are areas we can do better"
3584,We need to focus more on those health and wellness credentials across our adult brands
3585,"We also need to adapt more to the changing shopper environment as we go forward and make sure that our foods, our brands are available in those areas where the shoppers are shopping down the road"
3586,So what you said is what we're doing
3587,We segment this category through something we call demand chain
3588,It looks at consumer and it looks at shopper
3589,And it looks at cohorts within all different age groups
3590,"So we target, whether it's millennials, boomers, families, we constantly look at how the shopper shops as part of how we motivate and drive these brands"
3591,We can do more against boomers
3592,And we can do more against millennials and Hispanics in our portfolio
3593,We over-index against Hispanics and do very well there
3594,"Millennials, we need to drive relevancy"
3595,"This is why versatility comes into play and this is why those health and wellness credentials are really important in today's environment, but also important in the environments in which they shop and how they shop"
3596,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone"
3597,Let me start with the smokeable products segment
3598,"Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses"
3599,Smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.7% in the quarter
3600,"After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the industry decline rate"
3601,"In addition, California's cigarette SET, which went into effect on April 1, will also affect shipment volumes in the short term"
3602,"PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 0.1 share point; Marlboro's retail share declined by 0.2 share point to 43.6%"
3603,"In smokeless, adjusted OCI margins decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9%, driven principally by the Recall impact, partially offset by higher pricing"
3604,The Recall drove USSTC's shipment volume down 5% in the quarter
3605,USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2% over the past six months
3606,It was a tough quarter for wine
3607,Michelle's adjusted OCI of $21 million was 25% lower than last year and its margins contracted 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost
3608,Ste
3609,"Michelle's lower volume was driven by wholesalers reducing year-end inventory and the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in the first quarter of last year"
3610,Let's now turn to our beer investment
3611,"As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag"
3612,"In the quarter, Altria's reported equity earnings from our investment in ABI were $23 million"
3613,These results included net pre-tax charges of $73 million for ABI special items
3614,"As ABI noted in its fourth quarter earnings release, its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI's hedging of its share-based compensation payment programs"
3615,"We, of course, continue to focus on our shareholders"
3616,"In the quarter, we returned a large amount of cash to them, paying nearly $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing over $550 million in shares"
3617,"As of March 31, Altria had approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program"
3618,"We continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. As Marty mentioned, we continue to expect that our 2017 adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half"
3619,This is due primarily to the financial effect of USSTC's Recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting four full quarters of equity income from our ABI investment
3620,"Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting"
3621,"As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares had been restated"
3622,Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release
3623,You remember that IRI uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends
3624,Historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers
3625,That wraps up our results
3626,Marty and I are now happy to take your questions
3627,"While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria"
3628,com
3629,"Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we've posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items"
3630,"Operator, we're ready for the questions"
3631,Question-and-Answer Session
3632,"Yeah, Chris"
3633,"I think that's the proper way to look at it, Chris"
3634,"What we quantified was about 100 basis points, the impact of the recall and you're right, in the actuals, we were down 70 basis points"
3635,"Yeah, as Marty mentioned, we are pretty much done replenishing the out-of-stocks that occurred because of the recall at retail, and we are seeing share recover"
3636,"Now, remember, whenever you have that consumer purchasing other products in the marketplace, it takes a bit of time for us to recover the share, but we're seeing promising signs"
3637,"Hi, Judy"
3638,"As we answered that question at CAGNY, you'll recall, when we provide guidance, we run a range of scenarios that are included in the guidance, and so that'll take into account these types of events, and so we feel the same that we felt at CAGNY"
3639,We feel good about guidance and that's why we were able to reaffirm today
3640,Thanks for the question
3641,"If you recall, when we look at the cigar category, you have it in basically three segments"
3642,"You've got the tipped, where Black & Mild participates and has over about 90% of that segment"
3643,You have the un-tipped and then you have the non-cigarillo form
3644,We participate in the tipped and we have basically a large market share there
3645,And so that's why we're running for profitability
3646,That's where most of the profitability is in the cigar category
3647,"In the un-tipped segment, there's basically a price we're going on where people are competing for volume, but at a very low profitability, and we're really not participating in that segment"
3648,"So it hasn't been a change for us, but I think that describes the strategy and the approach we have in the cigar category"
3649,"Thank you, Jamie"
3650,"I am pleased to report that we are on track to meet our 2017 financial goals, with first quarter operating results right in line with our expectations"
3651,Organic revenue was up 2% globally
3652,"We delivered positive volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages, along with positive net price realization"
3653,And core constant currency EPS grew 7%
3654,"And despite the macro volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our organic revenue growth was driven by our developing and emerging markets businesses, with mid-single-digit organic revenue gains"
3655,"We are particularly encouraged by the broad-based gains we saw in our two largest developing and emerging markets, Mexico and Russia, where growth across snacks, beverages and dairy led to high single-digit organic revenue growth in each of these important markets"
3656,"And the developed markets, we grew organic revenue 1%, led by solid performance of Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages"
3657,"And we delivered this performance despite facing a few headwinds, including: the timing of the New Year holiday, which fell into the 53rd week of our 2016 fiscal year; a later Easter this year; and the delay of U.S"
3658,income tax refunds that dampened Q1 consumer spending across virtually every consumer category
3659,"With Q1 coming in line with our expectations, we remain confident in the full year 2017 outlook we shared with you last quarter, namely, organic revenue growth of at least 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 8%"
3660,We are proud of the strength and consistency of our performance over the years and we expect 2017 to be yet another strong year of achievement
3661,"As I wrote in my annual letter to shareholders, our performance has been enabled, in large part, by our anticipation of and response to far-reaching demographic environmental and societal shifts"
3662,"For more than a decade, it has been clear to us that if we wanted to make our future as bright as our past, we needed to transform our company in a number of critical ways"
3663,"With changing consumer preferences reflecting a growing shift towards healthier lifestyles, we needed to continue to transform our portfolio to offer more nutritious products"
3664,"With increasing strains on natural resources and the increasing importance governments are placing on protecting our planet, we needed to transform our operations to limit our environmental footprint"
3665,"And we're changing attitudes, values and demographics in the workplace, especially as Millennials enter the workforce in large numbers"
3666,We needed to transform our workplace and our culture to make sure we were meeting the evolving expectations of a new generation of associates
3667,The urgency of responding to these shifts is what gave rise to the approach we call Performance with Purpose
3668,"From the start, Performance with Purpose has been more than a slogan"
3669,"It's been an overarching vision, guiding every aspect of our business"
3670,It's about building a healthier future for all our stakeholders
3671,"Of course, this begins with generating healthy financial returns for our owners, but that is just the table stakes"
3672,Our challenge is to deliver them consistently and sustainably year after year
3673,"And the way we are doing this is by continuing to transform in five areas: first, making healthier foods and beverages for our consumers"
3674,"To meet the evolving needs of our consumers around the world, we are shifting our portfolio to a wider range of what we call: first, Everyday Nutrition products, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea; and two, what we call guilt-free products, which includes the Everyday Nutrition products plus beverages with 70 calories or less from added sugar per 12-ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat"
3675,"As a result, today, more than 45% of our net revenue is derived from guilt-free products"
3676,And our Everyday Nutrition portfolio is growing faster than the balance of the portfolio
3677,"This transformation has been enabled by a series of critical investments in R&D that are paving the way for new flavors and sweeteners, as well as ingredients and recipes"
3678,"And we are also investing in advanced manufacturing technologies, like our proprietary frying innovation that can reduce the amount of fat in potato chips by 20%"
3679,You see our commitment to our product transformation and our recent innovation around the globe
3680,"For example, in North America, we just launched LIFEWTR, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste"
3681,The brand fuses creativity with design to serve as a source of inspiration by featuring the works of some of today's top visual artists on the package
3682,We also launched LEMON LEMON
3683,"It's a sparkling lemonade, a modern take on an old tradition with bubbles, lemon juice and a touch of sweeteners, with just 70 calories per 12-ounce serving"
3684,"We launched IZZE FUSIONS, a next-generation sparkling beverage, modernized with unique flavors and just 60 calories per 12-ounce serving"
3685,"And we're expanding the lineup of our highly-successful Smartfood Delight popcorn, that contains just 35 calories per cup"
3686,"It's made with air-popped 100% whole grain popcorn, contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives and offers gluten-free and non-GMO project verified varieties"
3687,"In Brazil, we are launching new Quaker fruit bars made with oats and real fruit"
3688,"Quaker fruit bars are just 60 calories per serving, have no added sugar, has zero trans fats and are a source of fiber and Vitamin C"
3689,"In Russia, our J7 whole fruit line, containing 100% fruit juice and nectars with the fiber of a whole fruit, hit the market earlier this year"
3690,"In Mexico, we are expanding our global Sunbites franchise with the launch of three product forms, multi-grain chips, popcorn and plantains"
3691,"And in the UK, we launched Quaker Super Goodness in two forms, SuperGrains and Super Fruits, both made with 100% whole-grain oats with beta glucan, which has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels"
3692,And we believe there is much more room to grow in the space
3693,"For example, working with our retail partners, Quaker Foods North America has the opportunity to return to growth by leveraging one of the most beloved nutrition distribution brands to renew excitement in the center of the store through innovative merchandising"
3694,The second area is generating healthy growth for our retail and foodservice partners
3695,"As a result of all the investments we have made to position ourselves for success over the long term, from anticipating consumer trends to building a robust innovation pipeline, to transforming our product portfolio to meet consumers' needs, we are delivering top-tier growth for our retailers"
3696,"For the third consecutive year, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to branded retail food and beverage sales growth in the U.S"
3697,"In fact, in 2016, we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined"
3698,We're driving growth by leveraging our global scale and driving excellent local in-market execution
3699,"For example, in 2016, we placed with our retail partners more than 250,000 single-serve displays dedicated to our fastest-growing brands with our best innovation, driving growth in single-serve beverages for our retail partners and us"
3700,"By implementing the GES model pioneered Frito-Lay, our North America Beverage unit is improving order accuracy, reducing out-of-stocks and driving even greater levels of in-store service"
3701,"To drive growth with our foodservice partners, in just one year, we placed 20,000 Hello Goodness branded vending units that offer consumers access to foods and beverages from across the PepsiCo portfolio that meet certain nutrition criteria"
3702,"And we are building a powerhouse e-commerce team, creating global capability in markets from the U.S"
3703,to China to the UK and tailoring that capability with retailers to fit their growth strategy
3704,"Third, we are contributing to a healthier planet while boosting our bottom line"
3705,"One of the central planks of Performance with Purpose, the vision we set out over a decade ago, has been protecting our planet and conserving natural resources"
3706,"We continue to advance these efforts in a number of ways, including responsible water use, shrinking our carbon footprint across our supply chain and reducing our waste and packaging material, not only because it's the right thing to do, because it's the smart thing to do for business"
3707,"I am pleased to report that globally, approximately one-third of our plants have now achieved near-zero waste landfill while reducing, reusing or recycling their waste"
3708,And our efforts continue
3709,"In January, we activated a wind turbine at our Skelmersdale plant in the UK, which is now providing 25% of the site's electricity with this renewable energy source"
3710,"These and many other environmental sustainability initiatives are not only shrinking our environmental footprint, they're also substantially reducing our costs and boosting the bottom line"
3711,The fourth area is creating a healthy workplace and culture for our associates
3712,The extraordinary men and women who make up our company are our greatest assets
3713,"That's why we're committed to remaining a place that the best and brightest come, not only to earn a living, but to build a life by fostering a healthy workplace and culture"
3714,So we've undertaken a broad set of initiatives: to build a work force that's diverse and inclusive; to provide working caregivers the support and flexibility they need to meet their responsibilities at work and home; to foster learning; and to promote more effective ways to work together
3715,"For example, in North American Beverages, we've declared 2017 to be the year of the frontline leader and launched frontline leader excellence training to our almost 3,000 frontline managers, with topics covering employer advocacy, time management and career building"
3716,"And at Frito-Lay, we are piloting innovative programs to address the continuous need for skilled labor by creating a variety of programs aimed at skill development for our current associates as well as partnerships with local technical schools for development of future talent"
3717,Our workplace and culture are more than the product of corporate policies
3718,"It also reflects our values, holding ourselves to the highest standards of excellence, speaking with truth and candor and selling only products we can proudly stand behind"
3719,And the fifth area is promoting healthier communities wherever we operate
3720,"Although we're thought of as a global enterprise, we are also members of every local community where we do business"
3721,"Our associates live there, we make our products there and we often source our raw materials there"
3722,"For all of these reasons, we have a stake in the local communities we serve and we work hard to meet our responsibilities to them"
3723,"An important way we contribute to our communities is by creating well-paying jobs, along with the possibility of long, successful careers"
3724,We are also doing our part to be a good neighbor in other ways
3725,"For example, in Chicago, for over a decade, we've been the title partner of the largest high school soccer tournament in the U.S"
3726,", the PepsiCo Showdown"
3727,"In 2017, there are 216 Chicago area high schools and more than 21,500 student athletes involved in the event, which is built around the theme Make a Difference On AND Off the Field"
3728,"Relatedly, there is a monthly community service push with the thousands of PepsiCo Showdown student athletes to cultivate leadership for a brighter future"
3729,"And throughout Mexico, our Entrepreneurship for Growth program supports youngsters from vulnerable communities to improve their quality of life, to develop enough soft skills through sport and hard skills through technical education"
3730,"So taken together, these steps form a virtuous cycle that's powering our ongoing transformation as a company, enabling us to do well by doing good and positioning us for success, not only over the short term but also over the long term, adding to both the durability and duration of our shareholder value creation"
3731,"So net-net, we feel good about the state of our business"
3732,We are on track to deliver our full-year financial targets
3733,"And we are managing our business to both the short-term and the long-term in a way that delivers healthy, sustainable returns to our shareholders"
3734,"With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston"
3735,"Thank you, Lauren"
3736,"Let me just say that, clearly, in the first part of the quarter, several things happened"
3737,One is the fact that the New Year build up into the 53rd week of 2016 and then we had the slowdown because the tax refunds were delayed
3738,"By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, the business started to pick up again"
3739,So we aren't really concerned
3740,It's just a timing issue
3741,"I'd just say globally, our business is looking good"
3742,Let me quickly give you a snapshot of what we are seeing globally
3743,Europe is doing very well
3744,"The return to growth has been impressive, so we are feeling very good about Europe, across all parts of Europe"
3745,"The Latin American continent, outside of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, is good, but Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are causes for concern"
3746,"The Middle East is retooling itself, and we have to wait for it to figure out how they're going to come out of the oil price decline"
3747,"China, the GDP growth is good"
3748,"Our snacks and nutrition business is doing very well, and our beverage business is slowly recovering"
3749,And India is coming out of a bold demonetization now to remonetization
3750,"There's good GDP growth and we feel good about our business prospects there, too"
3751,And as far as the U.S
3752,"is concerned, as we head into the second quarter, we don't have a reason to be worried"
3753,"Morning, Ali"
3754,"You know, Ali, those are all very good questions, but every one of these concerns can also be reframed as an opportunity"
3755,"And that's really what we do because if PepsiCo's business is over-developed in C-stores, we look at expanding in grocery and other channels, whether it's foodservice or vending, as a bigger opportunity"
3756,And then we look to see how we can leverage our DSD system to grow our business into new categories in C-stores
3757,And that's what has made us more valuable partners to convenience store retailers
3758,"And in terms of difficulty with impulse on online, we've built a very good e-commerce business"
3759,It's growing at impressive rates
3760,"I don't want to discuss those rates, but it's growing at impressive rates"
3761,"And clearly, our challenge is to create impulse online"
3762,And we are working on tools with all of our partners to make our categories look like impulse categories online
3763,"It's a work in process, but I must tell you that our growth rates are quite impressive"
3764,"And in terms of health and wellness and impacting the snacks business, look, snacks are simple pleasures of life"
3765,What we are doing is making our snacks more permissible
3766,We're reducing the saturated fat levels
3767,We remove trans fats
3768,We're reducing the sodium levels
3769,"If you're going to eat a snack, eat a PepsiCo snack"
3770,And there's nothing wrong with eating a snack that's guilt-free
3771,"So our goal is to offer you a range of options from sort of fun-for-you products to guilt-free products, which include Everyday Nutrition, both in a snacking form and in a food-like form"
3772,"And at this point, we are singularly focused on growing the core, expanding out of the core but making sure across the board we make them a lot more permissible"
3773,And it looks like that strategy is working at this point
3774,"Morning, Dara"
3775,"Morning, Judy"
3776,And we're already seeing the volume back
3777,"Morning, Andrea"
3778,"Morning, Laurent"
3779,"Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Good morning, Indra"
3780,Question about Quaker
3781,"I mean, despite Quaker being one of the LTS of all (34:54) PepsiCo brands, it seems the top line has been soft for quite some time, now including this quarter"
3782,"At the same time, operating margin have reached a new high with 27.4% in the quarter"
3783,So could you please give us more color on this business segment and is this first quarter kind of a reflection of what we should see for the entire year?
3784,"Great question, Laurent"
3785,I'd say the Quaker business internationally outside the United States is doing very well
3786,"Solid growth, we are entering new markets"
3787,"It's doing very, very well"
3788,", the Quaker North America numbers that you see includes the Quaker hot cereal, which is where the Quaker brand is housed"
3789,"And then all of the other businesses that go within Quaker North America, including Rice-A-Roni, Pasta Roni, Aunt Jemima, there's a whole bunch of other businesses, ready-to-eat cereals"
3790,One-third of the business is the Quaker hot cereals
3791,"And the Quaker hot cereals business, I'd say, over the past few years, has been flat to very slightly down"
3792,And the only reason why the overall portfolio looks negative is because it's center store business in grocery stores
3793,"And the overall center store category is down high single digits, sometimes even low double digits in some quarters"
3794,"And so while we are outperforming the center store categories handsomely, I think our next challenge is how do we leverage our relationships with retailers to reinvent center store"
3795,And that's a conversation we've been having with some of the retailers to say how can we help you rethink the center store so that we can bring growth back to that category
3796,"And we need to do that in order to bring interest back to that whole cereal aisle and, therefore, Quaker"
3797,"By itself, Quaker remains a much-loved brand and it's profitable"
3798,"And our hope is that with the rejuvenation of center store, our categories grow, too"
3799,"I think to talk about elasticity on a category basis is too general, Vivien"
3800,I think we look at elasticity sub-segment by sub-segment
3801,And all the pricing we've put in place in the U.S
3802,is very carefully looking at the elasticity curves
3803,"And we look to see what kind of pricing the consumer can adopt, what kind of volume impact it will have and what can we sustain as a portfolio"
3804,And I think that what you're seeing right now is pricing that was sensible for the first quarter
3805,"And as the year goes on, I mean, look, we put the pricing in place in Q1, or in fact, I'd say Q4 we started putting the pricing in place, and that's ticking through the year"
3806,And we modify that as we go along if we believe that we need to change our promotional calendar to accommodate the consumer trends
3807,"I don't know, Hugh, if you want to add anything"
3808,"Hi, Robert"
3809,"No change in tone of business, and I think consumer confidence continues to remain as positive as we've seen it"
3810,"Morning, Kevin"
3811,"Thanks, Kevin"
3812,"Look, at the end of the day, we oppose beverage taxes that are regressive and unfairly target one category or industry"
3813,"I think, unfortunately, today's beverage taxes are more revenue generation-focused rather than health-focused"
3814,"But whatever the reason be, from our perspective, we are working on two things: one, making our portfolio deliver products that are lower in sugar and a lot of zero sugar products and beverages with positive nutrition"
3815,"So that's one part of our strategy, and we've been working on that for 10 years"
3816,"The second part of our strategy, making sure we bolster the rest of the portfolio outside of beverages"
3817,"So when taxes do come in, we can cushion the effect through managing the portfolio in a more intelligent way"
3818,And that's been our strategy over the last decade because we anticipated some of these trends early on and we started to re-tool the company for that
3819,"So at this point, let me just say that our strategy is crystal clear and we feel comfortable as to where we are headed"
3820,So let me just close by thanking you all for your questions
3821,"To summarize, we will continue to manage everything within our control to deliver attractive results in the short-term as we continue to position the business for long-term success"
3822,"Thank you all for joining us this morning and, more importantly, thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment"
3823,"Thank you Bill, and good morning everyone"
3824,Fiscal 2017 was a successful year for Sysco and I'm proud of the results our associates have accomplished this year
3825,"They are executing at a high level as we continue to achieve the key strategies levers of our current three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars and managing overall expenses"
3826,"Fiscal 2017 was marked not only by our strong performance in which we continued our relentless focus on the customer, but also because of the some important highlights that include the addition of the Brakes business in Europe, a completion of the successful transition of 12 operating companies from SAP through enhanced version of our legacy ERP system, and validation of our customer-centric approach to our business as reinforced by the improvement in our customer loyalty scores"
3827,"An example is our approach to giving customers a choice in how they want to interact with us, whether it’s through our best-in-class sales force, via our mobile platform or through a phone call"
3828,I would now like to discuss our segment results starting with U.S
3829,Foodservice Operations including some highlights of key strategic initiatives that are helping to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace
3830,"In addition, I will speak to the performance of our International Foodservice Operations"
3831,"Foodservice segment had a solid year with fiscal 2017 results on a comparable 52 week basis of sales growth of 1.5% and gross profit growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7.8%"
3832,"We once again experienced strong growth in our local business, up 2.4% in U.S"
3833,This was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business due to our efforts to deliver disciplined profitable growth
3834,This resulted in approximately 1% total case growth overall
3835,"As we progress through the next year, we expect to see those trends around our multi-unit business begin to improve"
3836,"Importantly, as we strive to provide value for our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with e-commerce capabilities, we are seeing them reward us with growth for the 13th quarter in a row"
3837,Looking at gross profit growth for U.S
3838,"Foodservice Operations, on a comparable 52 week basis, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 48 basis points, as we manage the deflationary environment in the first part of the year very well and are now working our way through an inflationary environment"
3839,"Poultry, produce, seafood and dairy are driving the current inflation and we expect inflation to continue for the balance of the calendar year"
3840,Our strategic focus on accelerating growth of local customers is working
3841,It all starts with an insight-based customer-centric approach that permeates everything we do
3842,"For example, we have improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology and targeted specialized resources and as a result our marketing associates are spending more time working with our customers on value-added activities and consultative services such as menu analysis, inventory management and business reviews"
3843,These services foster a deeper relationship with our customers and further enforces the importance of sales force play in helping our customers succeed
3844,"From a cost perspective, within U.S"
3845,Foodservice Operations our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 1.7% on an adjusted 52 week comparable basis for the year
3846,Looking at U.S
3847,"Broadline, cost-per-case for fiscal 2017 improved by approximately $0.01 compared to the prior year"
3848,"And on a fuel price neutral basis, cost-per-case increased by one penny"
3849,The consistent performance we have been to achieve is driven by key strategic initiatives which are supported by the expansive network of dedicated hard working front line associates in the warehouse and those team members delivering our products; through their efforts we have consistently been able to deliver a high level of service to our customers
3850,Looking at the overall performance for the U.S
3851,"foodservice operations on a 52 week comparable basis, I'm pleased with how all of our associates executed our plan; as our adjusted operating income performed well and we were able to improve adjusted operating margins by 45 basis points for the full-year"
3852,Moving to international foodservice operations; on a 52 week comparable basis sales and adjusted operating income nearly doubled both largely driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group
3853,During the year Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in the UK as they exceed our expectation for EPS accretion contributing $0.14 per share
3854,They are also making good progress in their supply chain transformational efforts as they move to multi-temp capability across the UK
3855,Growth in France remains steady and Sweden continues to produce favorable results
3856,We also continue to see long-term opportunities for growth across our new European business
3857,Additionally we are in the process of integrating our Ireland businesses and things are progressing well; we expect to achieve modest benefits from these activities
3858,"Looking forward, we are excited about the long-term opportunities to create value for our customers in the European business"
3859,Over the next few years we will invest capital and resources to build on the existing foundation of the business as we continue to work on key strategic initiatives that will position us well for the future
3860,We remain pleased with our performance in Canada despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline
3861,Our Canadian business has seen positive momentum in the growth of its local business driven by improved sales execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives such as category management and revenue management
3862,In addition we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity
3863,"As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver positive performance"
3864,Turning to Latin America we are excited about the new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama
3865,"Specifically in Costa Rica, we recently opened a 180,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility with the test kitchen and training facilities"
3866,This new space is enabling new products and full product lines to be available to our customers and we are excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver
3867,"As we enter the new fiscal year, we do so with strong momentum and I believe fiscal 2018 will bring opportunities for Sysco"
3868,Our ongoing focus on customer insights and delivering against their needs for innovative products and consultative services will enable our sales force to continue to add significant value and deliver growth with those local customers
3869,We will need to effectively manage the ongoing transition to an inflationary environment with our customers while staying focused on gross profit growth and we will continue to focus on driving efficiency from our supply chain through our expansive network that is built to provide a high level of service to our customers
3870,"In summary, fiscal 2017 showed important progress against our customer-centric strategy for Sysco"
3871,"Our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering on our financial objectives"
3872,"Finally, as I work through the leadership transition with Bill, I'm personally honored to be given the opportunity to lead this amazing Company and I'm incredibly excited about the future for Sysco"
3873,"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details"
3874,"Hey, Kelly"
3875,"Good morning, it’s Tom"
3876,I think we continue to feel that the independent segment is well positioned to continue to perform at a decent level
3877,"Obviously as we talked, there is been some I would say some softness in restaurants in general, but I think we still feel like the independents are well positioned whether it’s the product offering that they have, their ability to be flexible to meet the changing consumer needs"
3878,"I think the other thing just as always a reminder is because of our - whether it’s our current share of the market or the fragmentation that exists generally in foodservice, we continue to believe that there is lots of opportunity for us to grow and whether that’s in independent restaurant segment or other segments of our business"
3879,"Good morning, John"
3880,"What I think specifically to those areas we are fortunate at Sysco, we have got an organization and a business structure that is exists around specialty meat and produce that positions us well"
3881,"And so, I think we continue to believe that center of the plate is an important category and I think we look at that and say whether it’s the way we have structured ourselves now or the fact that we have got those capabilities that we are well positioned to grow"
3882,"And so, whether or not that’s going to be a significant acceleration or not probably has much to do with what is going on broadly in the marketplace, but I think we feel like we are well positioned and we continue to work on improving even our current position in those areas"
3883,"And then regarding just generally how we are feeling about it, as I mentioned the UK market certainly had some choppiness in it, but I think we are feeling good about where we can be positioned there"
3884,We had good movement in growth in France and we feel good about our business in Sweden and obviously with what we are doing in Ireland we continue to feel pretty good about that as well
3885,"So, I think overall we feel like we remain pretty well positioned and I think we are just obviously going to have to keep an eye on what is going on from a market perspective, but I think we are positioned how we are performing we feel pretty good"
3886,We do have some investments we need to make over the next year there and we feel like that’s an important part of us continuing to build on the work they had started pre-acquisition and we shared and talked a little bit about that earlier
3887,Yes
3888,"So, a couple of things, as we talked, we had consistent improvement in the local growth over the last 13 quarters quite honestly, but we talked about the 2.7% in the fourth quarter for local; the contract business or the CNU we talked about it was in fact negative for the quarter and that's consistent with what we have talked about as we have looked at our portfolio and as Bill mentioned earlier we had certain customers we made some decisions on and there are customers who had made some decisions around doing business with us"
3889,"But we continue to feel really good about the overall number that 1% comes from a combination of the contract business declining and the local business continuing to be strong; and my comment about improving is we do see some lapping of that happening in fiscal year 2018 and we also have some new business, will be coming on later in the year"
3890,"I think the only thing I would just add, just lot of the questions that we get - questions on minimum wage loss and this and that and the other thing and that’s an impact on our customers in terms of the things they are dealing with that doesn’t necessarily or doesn’t really impact us at all and that most of our labors as well double or wage rates"
3891,"I don’t know if we can help you with that one today, Chris"
3892,"Andy this is Tom, I think the first thing I'd start with is when we talk we talk a lot about this, it remains very competitive out there"
3893,"We have lots of competitors in general and from a market perspective I think we continue to look at leveraging all of the capabilities we have whether it’s things like the category management we talked about to make sure we have got the best cost on products or its revenue management tool, so we make sure that we are pricing products appropriately in the marketplace and making sure we are taking care of our customers"
3894,We still feel really good about obviously our ability to grow and our ability to do it in the right way and I think that’s really what you are seeing
3895,I don’t think there is any specific thing that’s happened in addition to that
3896,"This is really about a balanced approach, making sure we are focused the right levers of the business that starts with that local customer where we can incremental value and doing the things that help basically get recognized and rewarded by them for providing the right products and the right services in a right way"
3897,So I don’t think there is anything beyond that that you should read into it
3898,"So on the contract side, as I said earlier, I think you will see us showing some improvement in those numbers as we get into fiscal year 2018, because of the both lapping some of the decision were made last year and also we have some new business that will be coming on"
3899,"So, I think you should feel like there will be some improvement there"
3900,"Regarding the local business, I mean we continue to feel really good about how we are positioned and as we talked about why we feel like we are able to succeed in that space has really more to do with how we are focused on delivering the value for those customers"
3901,I did say in my prepared comments about our loyalty score is going up
3902,"And I think one of the things as we think about what drove that, we talk to our customers a lot and what we have heard was everything from they are feeling about our marketing associates and continuing to add a lot of value through our selling resources and that means we are accomplishing the things we said, which is making them much more capable on and be more consultative and how they are working with our customers"
3903,"We also heard good things around our technology platform, so I think we feel really good about the types of strides we are making the strategic initiatives we have been talking about"
3904,And so I think to us that’s confirmation that the things we are trying to do for these customers is working
3905,"Thanks, Ken"
3906,Good morning and welcome everyone to our first quarter call
3907,"Today, we’ll discuss our results in the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and the actions we’re taking to improve our performance and to position Campbell for long-term growth"
3908,"When we last spoke in September, we outlined our expectations for fiscal 2018 and indicated that we anticipated a challenging first half"
3909,"However, the first quarter was weaker than we expected, particularly for our U.S"
3910,soup business
3911,"In the quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, driven primarily by declines in U.S"
3912,Adjusted EBIT declined 14%
3913,There were several factors that contributed to this performance
3914,"First, in September, we discussed how a key customer’s different promotional approach to the soup category would negatively impact our U.S"
3915,"soup business in fiscal 2018. This had a larger impact on sales than originally anticipated, primarily due to a lower seasonal inventory build compared to a year ago"
3916,"The dialogue with this key customer remains open, and I’m very optimistic that we will reach a positive resolution"
3917,"Second, unfavorable weather negatively impacted carrot crop yields and led to supply constraints and higher than expected cost"
3918,"As a result, we placed customers on allocation in the quarter"
3919,We expect to be off allocation by December
3920,"And finally, the hurricane recovery efforts in Florida and Texas resulted in higher than expected supply chain costs, due to the surge in demand for transportation and logistics"
3921,We’ll be impacted by this in the near-term but the cost impact will moderate over time
3922,"As a result of the factors that impacted gross margin and our commitment to maintain investments in the business, we updated our fiscal 2018 guidance, this morning"
3923,"For fiscal 2018, our outlook for sales remains unchanged"
3924,We continue to expect net sales to be in the range of minus 2 to flat for the year
3925,"However, we have lowered our earnings outlook, reflecting our gross margin performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year"
3926,"We now expect adjusted EBIT to change by minus 4% to minus 2%, previously minus 1 to plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by minus 3 to minus 1%, previously flat to plus 2%"
3927,"The operating environment remains challenging for the many reasons we’ve cited over the past year, but we continue to believe that it’s imperative to invest back in our business to differentiate our brands, to drive innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing, and snacking to accelerate our e-commerce capabilities and to diversify our portfolio"
3928,That’s why we remain committed to reinvest a portion of our ongoing cost savings into the areas that hold the greatest prospects for growth
3929,"In Q1, we continued to invest back in our core business and in the pursuit of new growth opportunities including support for our product innovations, our real food efforts, building our e-commerce unit as well as funding longer term innovation efforts"
3930,"First, we’re supporting our new product innovations such as Well Yes! soup and Chunky Maxx soups, Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies and Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, a dairy alternative with 10 grams of protein"
3931,"Second, in real food, we completed the transition out of BPA in our can linings in the United States and Canada, and continue to convert our soups to chicken with no antibiotics"
3932,"Third, our newly formed e-commerce unit in North America has been very active"
3933,"While small, our e-commerce sales increased significantly in the quarter"
3934,We launched several meal kits through our strategic partnership with Chef’d
3935,"We also made progress on enhancing our distribution capabilities in partnership with DHL, opening a facility in Fort Worth and breaking ground on another in Ohio"
3936,This will help meet the growing demand for customization from both traditional and e-commerce customers
3937,"In health and well-being space, we continue to fund Habit, a personalized nutrition start-up"
3938,Habit is an example of how we’re investing in new models of innovation
3939,"Over time, we expect multiple business models to emerge"
3940,"Following the national launch of its nutrition test kits in August, the Habit team is expanding rapidly and adding top talent"
3941,And we also continued our venture capital activities as the single limited partner in Acre Venture Partners
3942,"However, these efforts are not enough"
3943,"While we’re moving in the right direction and positioning the Company for long-term success, our Q1 results are clear indication that we have more to do to complete our strategic transition, including more innovation, focused on health and wellbeing, and snacking, gaining a larger share of e-commerce revenue and a greater presence in growth channels, increased expansion in developing markets and continued focus on external development"
3944,"Speaking of external development, as you know, on September 27th, we delayed the closing of our acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon, pending their resolution of some recently filed litigation unrelated to Campbell"
3945,"While the timing is not yet definite, we have reason to believe that conditions will be met that will allow us to complete the transaction by the end of 2017. With that as context, I’ll review our performance across our divisions"
3946,"Let’s start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages where sales and operating earnings, both declined"
3947,The decline in the topline was driven primarily by U.S
3948,soup and V8 beverages
3949,soup sales declined 9%
3950,"As I stated earlier, a lower seasonal inventory build versus year ago at a key customer accounted for 7 points of the decline and 2 points were due to reduced consumer takeaway"
3951,"There is positive performance in the balance of the marketplace, where our soup program has been well received and consumer takeaway is up slightly"
3952,"We have strong business plans with our key customers; we’re driving trial of our new products, Well Yes!, Chunky Maxx and Swanson soup kits"
3953,And we continue to support our brands with competitive levels of advertising and consumer promotion
3954,"While we’re experiencing private label competition in our broth business, private label market share in soup is below average for center store food categories and up slightly"
3955,We constantly innovate and test our products to ensure they meet or exceed consumer taste preferences
3956,"We believe that innovation and brand differentiation are critically important in the soup category, which is why we’re continuing to invest in our brands"
3957,"The shelf-stable beverage category remained challenged, and sales of V8 products declined"
3958,"Despite this decline, we’re seeing positive consumption trends on V8 Vegetable Juice and V8 +Energy"
3959,"We’re pleased with the sales gains of our Simple Meal products, driven by Prego as well as sales growth in Canada in food service"
3960,"Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging"
3961,"And therefore, we’re taking additional actions to improve our performance"
3962,We started to shift our soup marketing spending from equity building campaigns to a sharper focus on product attributes that differentiate Campbell brands
3963,We’re increasing in-store presence with stronger messaging and we’re aggressively ramping up our ecommerce plans
3964,"Now, shifting to our Global Biscuits and Snacks division"
3965,"Overall, I feel good about our performance in Global Biscuits and Snacks to start the year"
3966,This division delivered growth on both the top and bottom lines
3967,Sales gains were primarily driven by the continued solid performance of Pepperidge Farm
3968,This sales growth was fueled by our snacks business with one-two punch from crackers and cookies
3969,Our Goldfish crackers continued to outperform the category in a meaningful way
3970,"In fact, Goldfish became the number one snack cracker in the category over the last quarter"
3971,The brand’s continued growth was fueled by our increasing ounces into houses approach
3972,This is all about providing wholesome delicious snacks that can be enjoyed in a variety of new packaging formats including single-serve multipacks
3973,"The second driver of our sales growth was our cookie business behind the successful launch of the Farmhouse brand, Milano cookies and the rejuvenated Pepperidge Farm chunk cookie line"
3974,The Farmhouse launch is one of Pepperidge Farm’s best product introductions in over a decade with strong trial and repeat
3975,"Made with simple ingredients, this thin, crispy cookie is the type of snack consumers are seeking and has been incremental to the category"
3976,We employed a similar approach with our Pepperidge Farm chunk cookies
3977,"We improved our recipes using larger chocolate chunks and cage-free eggs, while also updating and simplifying our packaging"
3978,It’s satisfying to see our real food philosophy resonating with consumers in our cookie portfolio
3979,Outside the U.S
3980,", Asia-Pacific sales were mixed"
3981,Sales declines in Australia were partly offset by gains in Indonesia
3982,We faced increased competitive activity in Australia’s chocolate biscuits but delivered solid results in savory crackers behind the reintroduction of original shapes crackers where we gained share
3983,"Now, let’s turn to Campbell Fresh"
3984,"In Campbell Fresh, sales were comparable to a year ago"
3985,We’re encouraged that our CPG products grew for the second consecutive quarter behind Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms salad dressing
3986,Sales of Bolthouse Farms beverages were comparable to year ago
3987,We are now back to normal beverage capacity
3988,Our new co-packer was fully operational midway through the quarter
3989,"And our service levels steadily improved, helping us instill confidence with customers"
3990,"As a result, we started to return to more normal levels of promotional activity, late in the quarter and expect that trend to continue in the second quarter"
3991,"Looking ahead, we have strong innovation plans in place with the continued rollout of Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, new Garden Fresh Gourmet’s fresh soup and salsa products in the first half and a range of Bolthouse Farms dressing and beverages in the back half"
3992,Turning to farms
3993,Sales of carrots declined in the quarter
3994,Our carrot crops were negatively impacted by adverse weather
3995,"Due to these low yields, we placed customers on allocation in the quarter"
3996,"Learning our lesson from a similar experience in 2016, the new Campbell Fresh team did not compromise the quality of carrots we delivered to customers"
3997,"As stated earlier, we expect that we’ll be off allocation by December"
3998,We continue to expect Campbell Fresh to return to profitable growth this fiscal year
3999,"While I’m not satisfied with our results this quarter, I’m also not deterred"
4000,Despite challenges within U.S
4001,"soup, V8 and carrots, other parts of the business are growing"
4002,"The Global Biscuits and Snacks division remained a bright spot, especially Pepperidge Farm"
4003,"Simple Meals, Canada and food service performed well and the Campbell Fresh turnaround is progressing"
4004,We’re taking the appropriate steps to address our immediate issues and remain focused on the actions that will position Campbell for long-term growth
4005,"We will continue to invest to differentiate our brands, enhance our real food credentials, drive innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing and snacking, build our e-commerce organization, and pursue smart external development"
4006,"And now, I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro"
4007,"There is no question, Ken, that we have experienced volatility in the carrot business due primarily to weather issues in California dealing with extremes in rain and heat, which has affected the crop"
4008,"While we can’t control the weather, we can control what we do about it"
4009,"And I believe that we did the right thing this time around by putting customers on allocation, not harvesting early, and keeping the quality of our carrot"
4010,Understand that the role of carrots in this business is it’s the scale of distribution for the CPG products
4011,And one of the reasons why we acquired the business was to grow the CPG portion and recognize that the carrots are the chassis for distribution at best pricing
4012,"So, we’ll continue to take this into consideration going forward"
4013,"We’d like to get to the point of stability in carrots and growth in CPG, and that’s our strategy"
4014,"Well, I can’t talk about any specifics"
4015,I can say that the dialogue remains open and it’s very positive
4016,I’ll answer that question from a couple of perspectives
4017,"First of all, in the rest of the market, soup program has been very strong"
4018,"New products have been well-received, new Well Yes! is at 83% ACV distributions, we're supporting the brands, new Chunky Maxx has hit the market now with 40% more protein, and protein is really on trend"
4019,"So, we’re pretty pleased with the performance in the rest of the market with consumption up slightly"
4020,So that -- and we believe we’ll continue to see that momentum into the second quarter
4021,The other fact is that our other businesses in this key retailer are incredibly robust
4022,"So, I would say that I do agree that the soup situation is isolated"
4023,"I’ll take the first part, Andrew"
4024,"We said this in September, but we expect that the first half on soup will be weaker than a year ago, and we expect some more momentum in the second half"
4025,I don’t think private label is a new phenomenon
4026,Private label is pretty prevalent
4027,And what we have seen is more of a push on private label in the broth business in the market at large
4028,"Actually, our -- the share that private label has of condensed soup and RTS soup is significantly below the average in center store categories and only up slightly"
4029,But broth has definitely been impacted
4030,"The Pacific Foods brand is highly differentiated, being organic and natural"
4031,"So, we believe that will be a good add to our line"
4032,"Just for clarification, because we’re in the snacks category and many fresh categories, are you referring to the soup category?"
4033,Okay
4034,Let me star there
4035,"In our Pepperidge Farm business, we’ve seen a lot of robust consumption, particularly on Goldfish and cookies as I stated before"
4036,We continue to increase our shelf space merchandising
4037,"So, they are really doing a great job"
4038,"In Campbell Fresh, again, the CPG part of the business has returned to growth, up a couple of points for the second consecutive quarter"
4039,And we didn’t start promoting beverages until October
4040,"So, we will now return to a normal promotion schedule in quarter two and we have a huge innovation suite coming to market in quarter three"
4041,"So, we believe that the CPG part of Campbell Fresh will have momentum"
4042,"In the soup category and the rest of the market, we continue to see robust plans"
4043,"We do audit shelf every year, but we have not gotten results of that"
4044,We’ll let you know when we do
4045,"And so, we’re just running our play"
4046,I’m not going to comment on the specifics of customer programs
4047,"I mean, all I’m willing to say is that we are in open discussion and positive about it"
4048,"Chris, in addition, we have a very robust supply chain productivity program"
4049,"Since we’ve integrated the supply chain into Campbell’s and put them on our productivity program, we have a very good line of sight to some significant cost savings, which will enhance the profitability of the business"
4050,We do very robust analytics on our price gaps and thresholds of the brands versus private label
4051,"So, we have a good indication of what that looks like, both from the regular retail pricing and also the merchandising pricing with the frequency that we merchandise"
4052,"So, that’s under constant watch"
4053,And that’s not different
4054,We’ve been doing that forever
4055,"So, I would just say that in the broth business, what we have done to address private label, and that’s where we have experienced the competition, is, we’ve changed our advertising messaging more to house once and is differentiated versus private label, starting with the fact that the first ingredient in Swanson is chicken stack whereas the first ingredient in most private labels is water"
4056,"And so, we’re calling attention to some of the attributes that distinguish the Swanson brand from private label"
4057,"And then, of course, the pending acquisition of Pacific, as I mentioned, we’re pretty enthusiastic about what differentiation that brand brings to the line"
4058,"In RTS and condensed, private label is a factor but it’s really under average, and we haven’t seen an increase"
4059,"I mean, it’s been up slightly"
4060,"But, we continue to watch it and we’ll make sure we continue to be competitive"
4061,Yes
4062,"We said in September and continue to believe that we will have a weaker first half than second half in soup, based on what we know at this point"
4063,"And in terms of the gross margin, Anthony, do you want to handle that one?"
4064,Yes
4065,"In the back half, we have a greater mix in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business in Campbell Fresh"
4066,"The main thing to focus on is the consumption; in the quarter, soup consumption was down 2.3%"
4067,We have a couple of things going on there
4068,"And our e-commerce business is still small and for the industry, it’s small"
4069,"But, we’re focused on building capabilities in terms of really understanding the consumers’ path to purchase in that space"
4070,"We are working predominantly with pure play e-tailers and also omni, and we’re working with Chef’d on meal kits in that space"
4071,"So, we’re trying some different things"
4072,We’re working literally across all of our brands and bundling brands based on what the customer wants to do in that space
4073,"So, I think we’re trying a lot of things"
4074,One of the things that’s very encouraging though is we’ve brought in some top talent
4075,"And we believe that as more consumers shift to e-commerce, whether it’s order online pick up at store or order online and deliver to home, will be well-poised to participate and lead in that space"
4076,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 first quarter's earnings call"
4077,Q1 was a much better quarter
4078,"We saw strong growth in Luxury, continued positive momentum in Professional and a reduced net revenue decline in the Consumer Beauty division"
4079,"We delivered significant improvement in profits, driven by better gross margin performance and strong financial discipline on the cost structure"
4080,"We also continued making meaningful progress in our merger integration, and I'm glad to announce that, as of September 1, we have exited our third and final TSA for the ALMEA region"
4081,"Starting with Luxury, this was the third consecutive quarter of positive top line growth"
4082,"Luxury revenues increased 4% on an organic basis, driven by a successful innovation pipeline, excellent performance from several brands, and best-in-class in-store execution behind our launches, leading to double-digit growth in several countries"
4083,We also introduced two successful major new products this quarter: Gucci Bloom and Tiffany's debut fragrance
4084,"Gucci Bloom was the best fragrance launch ever in Macy's, the biggest Coty launch ever in Harrods, and the top two new product launch in every retailer we launched globally"
4085,"The Tiffany's launch was the biggest opening day and first week in five years at Bloomingdale's, and has been a top seller at several other key retailers globally, including travel retail"
4086,Our growth in Luxury is not limited to new launches
4087,"In fact, philosophy had a very strong quarter, growing net revenues double digits driven by strong sell-through in the U.S"
4088,", both in the retail channel and direct-to-consumer"
4089,"Additionally, we also launched new campaigns for HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy, which are driving very healthy growth in these pillars"
4090,These are clear results of what the new Coty is able to achieve
4091,"In our Professional division, the first quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth with net revenues increasing 1% organically"
4092,"Our hair business grew across all regions and we are seeing continued strong momentum on Wella Professionals, particularly in color"
4093,"In addition, System Professional continues making good progress on its global rollout, growing double digits in the quarter"
4094,"Additionally, OPI has continued to grow in North America, with international markets being our next area of focus"
4095,Consumer Beauty net revenue declined 8% on an organic basis and this remains a key focus for us
4096,"The decline was driven by declines in some of our brands, particularly retail hair, combined with continued weakness in the global mass beauty market"
4097,"Although I'm not happy with the Consumer Beauty divisional performance to date, I'm starting to see signs of a stabilizing business"
4098,"We're achieving this by actively engaging with retailer customers to amplify the in-store shopping experience to drive capital growth, working on accelerating our time to market with on-trend collections and new products, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation, and driving our e-commerce efforts"
4099,"For instance, in line with our goal to be faster to market, we were able to bring Clairol recent Color Crave hair makeup innovation to market in just six months"
4100,"Where available, this exciting new product has outperformed its main competitor"
4101,"And, as such, we expect to see increased shelf space allocation, which coupled with a game-changing innovation coming to Clairol in the second half, should further boost the brand"
4102,"While we continue to address challenges in North America and Europe, ALMEA continues to have several bright spots with highlights in Mexico, Australia, and Brazil"
4103,"Speaking of Brazil, this business continues to be a standout success story for Coty"
4104,Our year-to-date sellout is growing at double the rate of the underlying market
4105,"With a strong pipeline of innovations in our local and global brands, we remain confident in this story and, as an example, we just became the second largest player by volume in the deodorant market, doubling our share in 18 months after increasing our focus on this segment three years ago"
4106,I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished in Brazil and believe it's a clear example of what the company is capable of achieving via strategic M&A and focus on execution
4107,"As you know, we are also preparing the relaunch of several brands"
4108,In the recently announced COVERGIRL relaunch is another example of the strength of the new Coty
4109,"The brand's new statement of purpose, I Am What I Make Up, is COVERGIRL's biggest reinvention in its 60 years history"
4110,Our powerful relaunch film featuring six boundary breaking in cultural change agents COVERGIRLs result in astounding 4.1 billion impressions and 11 million views in a matter of few days
4111,I'm looking forward to sharing more good news in the second half of fiscal 2018 as the product and fixtures are rolled out in stores
4112,"We expect the combination of this brand initiatives, improving in market execution and consumer-focused communication strategy to support the gradual improvement in Consumer Beauty revenue trends"
4113,"As I said before, it will still take time for the full recovery of the Consumer Beauty division"
4114,"These positive results are directly linked to the growth strategy we've been articulating to you in the past several quarters, focus on repositioning select brands in order to reconnect them with consumers, building on their already strong brand equity, making significant changes to our innovation product development process in parts of the organization driven by faster and state-of-the-art execution, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce, collaborating even more closely with retailers to significantly ramp up our in-store execution"
4115,I want to be clear that there is still much work to be done to achieve our goals
4116,We have only just started this journey and fiscal 2018 will be an important milestone in this regard
4117,"After having put the foundation of the new Coty in place, we expect this year to be one-off stabilization"
4118,"And while results are likely to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, the improving net revenue trends give me confidence that the growth strategy outlined above is moving Coty gradually into a path of full recovery"
4119,"With regards to our cost control, following a disappointing fourth quarter, I told you that we would make the issue a top priority, and we have"
4120,"This quarter, our management team put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our signature program, which is expected to lead to help improvement in our adjusted operating income over time"
4121,I want to also highlight the positive results we are seeing from our M&A strategy
4122,"I'm pleased to say that Hypermarcas is driving very positive results in Brazil, where we're previously lacking scale, and ghd is bringing complementary technology and products to our Professional division"
4123,Younique is another example of a great addition to the new Coty
4124,"From day one, Younique has been a purpose-led business focused on empowering women"
4125,"Moreover, Younique's successful positioning and the intersection of social media and e-commerce is a best-in-class example of how brands can best connect with customers, a central objective for Coty as we work to reposition several of our key brands"
4126,"The continued growth in Younique active presenter base, which has increased nearly 20% since we began our partnership coupled with the continued strong double-digit top line growth, is a testament to the ongoing success and viability of this business model"
4127,"These strategic and complementary additions to our business fit our M&A criteria, and overall, our acquisition have performed very well"
4128,"Further, the recent Burberry acquisition complements our expertise and leadership in luxury fragrances, accelerates our presence in the premium category and provides a strong platform to enter into the fast growing prestige color cosmetic category"
4129,"All of these plans, launches, and accomplishment would not be possible without the new culture and mindset that we've worked so hard to nurture at Coty"
4130,"Our new value of own it and drive it, which focuses on accountability and execution, will be one of the keys to delivering sustainable growth and industry-leading margins over time"
4131,"We also have a great company purpose of celebrating and liberating the diversity of your beauty, which has been received extremely well by our employees and which distinguishes us in the industry"
4132,"At Coty, we have decided to take a stand to fight prejudice with a specific focus on ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and gender inequality"
4133,"And I'm excited that we're partnering with Global Citizen to fight the prejudice and discrimination that creates barrier to self-expression, individuality, and inclusion"
4134,"Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect to continue to deliver on our announced synergies, finalize the streamlining of our brand portfolio and re-launch several of our key brands"
4135,"With this program, we aim to deliver improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, as well as a healthy margin improvement over the balance of the year"
4136,"In closing, while there is much work to be done, I firmly believe our strategy is working"
4137,And I'm confident that all our efforts will lead to Coty becoming a new global leader and challenger in beauty
4138,I will now turn the call over to Patrice
4139,"Thanks for the question, Joe"
4140,"Let me start by reiterating what Patrice said, which is that our long-term focus is on achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins"
4141,And then this is in line with our investment thesis that we referred in our road show at the time of the merger
4142,And this is how we are making business decisions
4143,"Now, it's fair to say, as you know, that we have inherited a business which was smaller in revenues, but not in SG&A and, therefore, smaller in operating margin than our expectation at the time of the road show"
4144,"And because of this, when you combine also with the business challenges that we have faced last year and our better visibility into the aspect of the business that we have now since we exited the TSA, we believe that it will take us longer to get to the $1.53, even with our objectives of best-in-class operating margin of higher teens"
4145,"Thank you, Joe"
4146,"So, let me try to take one after the other"
4147,"So, first on the cost structure"
4148,"So, we told you that we would make this issue a top priority and we have"
4149,"This quarter, the management team has put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our synergy program, which is expected to lead to a healthy improvement in our adjusted operating income over time"
4150,"So, what we have done is to significantly strengthen our cost control measures on expenses"
4151,"We have also taken some measures to consolidate some commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency as I said in the script, and also deploying a number of global standard of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our sales force"
4152,"So, some of these initiatives have already led to tangible signs of progress during the first quarter and we are going to make some further progress in the year to come and our overall profitability will make good progress even though, as we said before, the bulk of our synergies from the P&G Beauty merger have yet to be achieved and are more second-half-of-the-year skewed"
4153,It's also fair to say that I'm not sure that the Q4 was a good benchmark and Q4 results reflected a certain non-recurring cost that were not included as onetime
4154,"For example, there were a number of Coty employees who were not fully dedicated to the integration, but who worked somehow on the integration, part time, and we did incur some costs related to supporting the TSA exit"
4155,"So, now all this is over because we have successfully exited all the TSA, and now we can really focus on driving the business going forward"
4156,"I'll answer all your question in more or less the order you asked me, okay? So, regarding the outlook, we expect to continue to deliver on the previously-announced synergies"
4157,We're going to finalize on the streamlining of our brand portfolio and relaunch several of the key brands and I'll get to the relaunch in a second
4158,"Now, if we take all these programs together, we aim to deliver; improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, as I said, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, which means roughly flat"
4159,"And when I look at the different promos that we're doing, clearly we have an improvement in the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty, that is a part of the objective that I just discussed and within Consumer Beauty we have a couple of relaunches which are quite important; the first one is, the COVERGIRL, which we just announced in October and I mentioned early a very positive sign of a reaction from the market on COVERGIRL"
4160,And but we also have the relaunch of Clairol
4161,"On Clairol, we just launched a product called Color Crave which is an hair makeup product, which we launched off the classical less shelf reset windows with the U.S"
4162,retailers
4163,And clearly we expect to gain some shelf space with this product once it's able to go in the normal shelf
4164,"Plus we are going to relaunch, also launch a second big innovation on Clairol in the second half of fiscal 2018 and therefore we expect these two relaunches to help us improving the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty"
4165,"Looking at the shelf space, I think it's important to remind that the shelf space decisions that impacted us were made prior to our acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business and the impact of those decisions continue to impact our results today and will continue for a while, because we need to annualize those decisions in the second half of 2018. And you know that not all the retailers redo their shelf at the same time"
4166,"But based on encouraging conversations that we had with retailers regarding the restaging of the COVERGIRL and Clairol and other various brands and also, sharing our innovation pipeline, we believe that we should retain most of the space for our key brands"
4167,"And the last question, I think, was e-commerce"
4168,E-commerce is important for us
4169,It's an area of focus for me and for the business
4170,I already mentioned this in previous calls
4171,"And we don't disclose e-commerce sales, but I can confirm they were growing at a healthy above the market rate in both our Consumer Beauty and Luxury division, although from a low base"
4172,I hope that I have answered all your questions
4173,"Talking about retail color, I think there is a couple of things"
4174,"And one of the things that I did mention in the past that this category has been always treated very, very functionally by everybody"
4175,"And, I think this needs to be treated more as a beauty category"
4176,"Now, this transformation is not immediate"
4177,"And regarding our brands, Clairol, this has been a brand that didn't receive a lot of investment attention for many years"
4178,And I did refer to this brand in the past as a neglected brand
4179,"So, from our point of view, we have a much stronger pipeline"
4180,"I did mention one of the launches that happened in the last few months and I did kind of give a preview that's going to be a big launch coming in the second half of 2018. But I believe that we have a very strong pipeline, which covers both the functional and the beauty area or the beauty part of this brand and this category"
4181,"And I think that our plans are strong, and that's why we believe that over time, we will be able to recover lost ground on this brand, and we've clearly come back to much more positive performance"
4182,"So, I believe that the experience in the store and innovation are both part"
4183,"And clearly, you have the communications or the positioning"
4184,"This brand also requires a bit of a different way of communicating to consumers, and we are working also on the relaunch from that point of view coming in the second half of 2018. Looking at Consumer Beauty, which is what you mentioned, as I said, because we're doing all this, we believe that we have a solid strategy in place and we are excited about the relaunches of several of our Consumer Beauty brands"
4185,And that's why we aim for the net revenue trends to improve over the year
4186,"But as I said, it will still take time for a full recovery of Consumer Beauty"
4187,"Good morning, Dara"
4188,"Look, full recovery, as I said, we are defining 2018 as a year of stabilization"
4189,"And that's why we believe that our sales in the second half will be roughly comparable with previous year, roughly flat"
4190,"And in terms of category growth, we believe that we are exposed more or less to around 2% of growth"
4191,"So over time, we expect of course to generate a similar level to the category growth, and then over time to grow share as well and become over-performing versus the market that we are exposed"
4192,But we're not going to put a timeline behind this path
4193,"What is important is, for us, that 2018 is giving us signs, is making us confident about stabilizing the business so that we can therefore take it from there and go to the next step"
4194,"So, taking your first question Wendy, in terms of rollout of COVERGIRL, yes, there will be some inventory destocking in the coming quarter, preparing for the arrival of old and new products, the new packaging, the new visuals on the shelf"
4195,"And in terms of how we are implementing this launch, there will always be some parts of the brand which is all the new innovation pipeline, which will be in and out, which means it's going to be a cut, right"
4196,And then the rest will be probably more of a phase-in and you can understand why depending on cost and inventory or on implementation as well
4197,"And in terms of – your second question was about Burberry, and regards to the inventory and when we expect some sales, as you can imagine, we only became the owner of Burberry"
4198,"So, we are in the process of understanding the level of stock there is in the market"
4199,So we're not able to make any comments about it
4200,"And so, we expect it to prepare our plans that we are already preparing, which will be strong plans"
4201,"And at some point, really, we will start recording sales"
4202,"But I don't have a visibility to give you about the exact month when we will be able to do that because, exactly, all the questions you asked on the stock"
4203,"Regarding the third question, Patrice, do you want to take the one about the 6% to 8%?"
4204,"Thanks, Jason, for the questions"
4205,"So, regarding the restage of COVERGIRL, as you can imagine, it's a competitive restage"
4206,"We have over 60,000 doors in the U.S"
4207,where COVERGIRL is distributed
4208,"So, it's a complex one, but so far everything that we are preparing is absolutely being prepared very well and it's going in the right direction"
4209,"And, yes, we're going to have an inventory reduction as I said before in my previous answer because that's what we're going to do to ensure that the arrival of all the new products and new packaging will fit faster and will paste faster into the billboards, the walls"
4210,"And what I can tell you why we're confident is, look, since we have announced the restage with the new positioning and the reaction has been truly, truly positive"
4211,"I mean, we did something in terms of the positioning that is absolutely relevant and when we talk about the freedom of self-expression, when we talk about creating any version of yourself with makeup, but this is truly having the right reactions"
4212,"But the one that makes me more confident is the reaction of our retailers, the customers, our partners"
4213,They are also the ones that are telling us that the way we are preparing this is absolutely superior to anything that has been done before by Coty and I guess also they have visibility over what they see in the market from other brands
4214,And this reaction makes me confident of course that we're going to have an increased productivity once we're able to bring the new news and the new visuals in the stores as well
4215,"Your second question I think it was about e-commerce in Professional Beauty and look, yes, I did mention a healthy growth above market rate in Consumer Beauty and Luxury because that's clearly very good"
4216,"In Professional Beauty, we also have a growing e-commerce business is smaller because, as you could imagine, Professional Beauty is mostly focused on salon professionals, so hairdressers, manicurists and so on"
4217,"But there has been some shift as well because some of the channels are blurring, so we're working actively in this area as well"
4218,"And you mentioned an app to look at on how you look and therefore being able at look at yourself to choose the right shade and so on, we have something absolutely like that on our brand, Clairol, which is going very well because it's absolutely one of the new way that consumers want to engage with brands and we have absolutely some of this technology as well"
4219,Yeah
4220,"I think your second question, Lauren, was about the net working capital already negative, which is very good"
4221,"This is a strong achievement, and we're very proud"
4222,"But we're also confident that we have a bit more to go on net working capital, and we keep working on it"
4223,"I think, as we said, we're still at the beginning of our journey, and we're putting in place a series of ideas and actions to improve this"
4224,"So, I think, there is a bit more to come"
4225,Yeah
4226,"I think your second question regards it's more of a quarterly outlook, which we really don't do"
4227,"What I can tell you is, as we said, we aim to see an improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year"
4228,"And in the second half, our top line, we aim to be roughly flattish or comparable to the previous year"
4229,"Now, when you look on a healthy margin improvement, which we aim to have over the balance of the year, this is where we aim, we expect to have a more pronounced impact in Q4 given the lower base of last year"
4230,On the margin
4231,"So, Andrea on your first question, which is the destock in Q2, this refers mostly to clearly some of the activities in the re-launches we're doing in the Consumer Beauty division and it's true we will have some destocking, but we still expect the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty to improve as a trend over the year and in the next quarters, starting from Q2. Regarding your second question, which is more of a question about the U.S"
4232,"mass channel, you mentioned color cosmetics"
4233,"Mass channel is a really important channel for all the beauty players and there has been some shift clearly in the way the consumer shop brands, e-commerce, specialty store and so on"
4234,"But, there will always be a place for products with strong value propositions, so for beauty brands with this characteristic"
4235,"And so, our focus is truly to build a closer partnership with the retail customers and ensure that we create an amazing consumer experience, in store and online"
4236,"So, this means right assortment"
4237,It means faster innovation
4238,"It means yes, yes, speed to market and so on"
4239,"So, that's where our focus is and we're working with our retailer partners to really bring back up the traffic in store through doing this"
4240,"One of the things that we did recently is this new concept store in New York called The STORY, which is a sort of experiential playground in which we test a lot of digital innovation around color cosmetics in this let's say experiential store"
4241,"And what we're trying to do is to see some of these ideas because now we have the learnings of consumer interacting there, can go back to the classical standard retailing environment"
4242,"So, we are really working well to try to change this"
4243,"Thanks, Mark, so a great question"
4244,"So actually, it's a good opportunity for me to reiterate that our investment thesis is still very valid"
4245,"So, our investment thesis is that there is usually a direct correlation between gross margin and EBIT across the FMCG industry but in beauty industry"
4246,And what we want to demonstrate is that we should be in a position to achieve a best-in-class operating margin
4247,Why? Because the level of investment that we currently have on our business is according to us roughly the right level of investment
4248,"There might be some difference between quarters here and there, between geographies, between segments"
4249,"The overall, at Coty, Inc"
4250,"boundaries, the level of investment that we have is about to be the right one, which means that the overall level of synergies of $750 million should fall bottom line"
4251,This represents roughly between 700 and 800 basis points of operating margin
4252,That's where we see the best-in-class operating margin
4253,"As I mentioned, Rosie, we have already two divisions, Luxury and Professional Beauty, that have been growing for quite a while"
4254,"So, the key focus of their attention is Consumer Beauty"
4255,The confidence in Luxury and in Professional Beauty comes from having seen the performance of our brands in the market
4256,"I mentioned in my script that the launch of Gucci Bloom and the launch of Tiffany have been successful so far, but it's not just these two new product launches"
4257,We see market share growth in HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy and several other brands
4258,"So overall, our portfolio both in terms of the classic pillars in Luxury and, but also in the innovation it brings to market, that includes philosophy, is performing quite well and, of course, that gives us confidence"
4259,"When I look at Professional Beauty, the growth that we're having in hair, which is one of the two category that we work in Professional Beauty, is actually positive"
4260,And it has been positive now for several quarters
4261,And this is the bulk of our business
4262,"This is where we believe we are growing market share, especially in color, which is the core part of Wella Professional"
4263,"And we expect to have this positive momentum and performance to continue because of the strength of our brands, but also the strength of the capabilities that we have in the professional business, in the professional service business"
4264,"And regarding Consumer Beauty, it's really, first of all, there are some spring and some excellent results that we're seeing in, especially in ALMEA"
4265,"And so, I mentioned Mexico, Australia, Brazil, but we have also some other, Bourjois continues to grow market share both in Europe, but also in Russia, Middle East"
4266,We have Rimmel having market share growth in several countries
4267,"So, there are several examples that clearly gives us this confidence of improving trends"
4268,"But as I said, Consumer Beauty will take time before a full recovery"
4269,"This is, clearly, the largest division we have"
4270,We have faced some challenges
4271,We continue to face some challenges and that's why we're going to continue to implement all our actions to implement the recovery
4272,"So, Jonathan, Younique is clearly an acquisition, a very strategic acquisition that we are very pleased with, and it continues to grow double digits"
4273,"So, the performance that we mentioned at the time of the acquisition continues to be true now that it's clearly under the partnership with us"
4274,"In terms of additional KPIs that you ask, there is one that is very telling, which is the sign-ups, so the basic recruitment of presenters"
4275,"And right now, we are approaching 100,000 presenters totally, overall, with over 100,000 presenters that joined us in Q1 2018 alone"
4276,"So, I guess, I think combining the net revenue, double-digit growth and the growth of the presenters, that clearly makes us satisfied with the performance"
4277,"In terms of the role that direct selling can play within Coty, I think that we have made what I would call a very strategic and successful acquisition with Younique"
4278,"We are very satisfied with it, and I believe direct selling has clearly a role to play within Coty given the growing size of Younique"
4279,"But the other reason why I believe that this is so relevant is because of the direct link between the presenters and the consumers, and this is very, very relevant in the current market where individualized and customized approach to consumers is a big trend"
4280,"And having a 100,000 presenters who are our brand ambassadors, who talk to millions of consumers out there on a daily basis, almost on an individual basis, because sometimes they do virtual parties with few people, but most of the time is individual basis, to me is also key to the performance that we're seeing in Younique"
4281,"Thank you, Ken"
4282,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter call"
4283,"Today, I’ll focus my remarks on the marketplace, our performance, our plans and our outlook for fiscal 2018. As we’ve discussed previously, the operating environment remains challenging across the food industry"
4284,While macro economic conditions in the U.S
4285,"continue to improve in the quarter, the seismic shifts we’ve described in the past continue to alter the consumer food and retail landscapes"
4286,"These disruptions include shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food with a focus on fresh and health and well-being and increase snacking behavior, a range of socioeconomic forces and technology advancements that are reshaping the consumer shopping experience"
4287,"Additionally, there is no denying that the retailer landscape is changing dramatically with the emergence of new players, new store formats, and evolving business models"
4288,"Several variables are at play, including value players expanding their presence in the U.S"
4289,", the growth of store brands and the explosion of e-commerce and meal delivery services disrupting the market"
4290,We expect conditions to remain hypercompetitive for the foreseeable future
4291,"In this environment what is Campbell doing to compete differently? First, we’re prioritizing investments, aligning our resources to future growth areas and creating opportunities from the disruptions in the market"
4292,"To our growth agenda, we’re focusing on four strategic imperatives to strengthen our core business and at the same time expand in the faster growing spaces"
4293,"Second, we’ve redesigned our retailer selling and support capabilities in June of fiscal 2017. Our new integrated structure aligns our sales and marketing resources to drive growth with existing customers and to pursue business in new channels"
4294,"We’re rethinking our approach to collaborating with key customers around platform merchandising, such as health and well-being and snacking"
4295,We’re enhancing our data-driven shopper insights
4296,"And through our strategic foresights work, we’re better positioned to drive innovation and customization across both the perimeter and in the center store"
4297,Most customers have welcomed this new level of engagement and collaboration
4298,"Third, we’ve established a distinct digital e-commerce business unit to address both pure play and omni-channel opportunities"
4299,"Finally, we believe that investing to differentiate our brands is the best way to appeal to consumers and build loyalty in a crowded market"
4300,"Make no mistakes, these shifts are accelerating and converging and they’re having a dramatic impact on Campbell and across the industry"
4301,"In this environment, sales growth remains challenging"
4302,"With this as a backdrop, our performance in the quarter was mixed"
4303,"Organic sales declined 1%, while adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, both increased double-digits"
4304,"Despite multiple headwinds, we finished fiscal 2017 within our guidance and delivered another year of growth in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS"
4305,"For the fourth quarter, our Global Biscuits and Snacks performance was slightly below what I would have liked in terms of the top line, but the team delivered a double-digit earnings increase versus the year-ago quarter"
4306,"Americas Simple Meals and Beverages continued to deliver against its portfolio role, with sales performance in line with the categories in which we compete and margin expansion"
4307,"I’m not happy with our performance in Campbell Fresh, but remain encouraged by the progress we’ve made this year to address our key executional issues"
4308,"C-Fresh delivered modest sales growth and we expect this business to return to profitable growth in fiscal 2018. Let me now offer my perspective on each division’s performance and highlight our plans for fiscal 2018, starting with Global Biscuits and Snacks"
4309,"Overall, I’m satisfied with the performance of the division in the quarter"
4310,"Organic sales were comparable to a year ago, with expected gains in Pepperidge Farm, but below my expectations in Arnott’s due to our performance in Indonesia"
4311,"Importantly, the business delivered a double-digit increase in operating earnings"
4312,"I’m particularly pleased with the performance of Pepperidge Farm snacks, especially the Goldfish brand, which once again delivered strong sales results"
4313,"In the quarter, growth was fueled by larger pack sizes"
4314,"Over an extended period of time, this team has delivered a steady cadence of innovation and effective marketing programs, while also expanding the brand’s health and well-being credentials with organic and whole grain offerings"
4315,"I’m also enthusiastic about the launch of our new Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Cookie line, a thin crispy cookie made with simple ingredients"
4316,Farmhouse is on track to be the biggest Pepperidge Farm snack launch in more than a decade
4317,"In Australia, the team delivered growth in biscuits behind the return to the original version of Arnott’s Shapes crackers"
4318,"Additionally, our new Tim Tam gelato-inspired varieties performed well"
4319,"Segment operating earnings increased 35%, as a result of our strong enabler program, a return to more normal marketing levels and reduced administrative costs"
4320,"Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect to grow sales in Global Biscuits and Snacks"
4321,"In Pepperidge Farm, we intend to dial up our real food and health and well-being efforts by emphasizing our goodness credentials"
4322,New snacking consumer insights will also shape how we connect with our consumers develop new packaging formats and adapt to new retail environments
4323,"In particular, we have plans to extend Goldfish to older kids, a new demographic for the brand"
4324,We’ll continue to execute the successful marketing strategy that has led to both sales and share gains this year by investing behind our proven Milano Moments’ campaign
4325,We also plan to build on the successful launch of Farmhouse Cookies and drive increased trial of Tim Tam biscuits in the U.S
4326,from both traditional retailers and e-commerce channels
4327,"In Australia, we have plans to strengthen our core with new varieties of Shapes crackers, expand our health and well-being offerings with new Arnott’s Vita-Wheat cracker chips and Cruskits products, drive on-the-go snacking with a variety of new multi-pack single serve products, and we recently launched an integrated Arnott’s master brand advertising campaign to support the business"
4328,Turning now to Campbell Fresh
4329,"I’m not satisfied with the performance this quarter, but I’m optimistic that our key executional issues are now largely behind us"
4330,"In the fourth quarter, Campbell Fresh returned to growth with a modest 1% increase in sales, driven by Garden Fresh Gourmet in our farms business"
4331,"However, sales in the beverage business declined slightly as we continue to deal with capacity constraints, largely due to newly enhanced quality processes we put in place, both in our plant and with our new co-packer"
4332,"As we previously said, we began increasing promotional activity towards the end of the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect to ramp up to normal promotional levels during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Let me be clear, I’m disappointed with the operating loss in Campbell Fresh this quarter, which reflects a number of costs that are one-time in nature, including higher carrot costs, as well as increased expenses to further refine our new quality protocols"
4333,"We have plans underway to increase efficiencies as part of our overall effort to eliminate supply constraints and improve margins, while delivering our new higher-quality standards"
4334,"As I said before, we’ve learned some tough lessons in C-Fresh"
4335,"Despite the executional challenges, we remain confident in the growth potential of the Packaged Fresh category, and believe our C-Fresh strategy is sound"
4336,"Throughout fiscal 2017, we took steps to build a stronger foundation for growth under our new C-Fresh leadership team"
4337,"Looking ahead, we plan for the business to grow profitably in fiscal 2018, as we return to more normal capacity and promotional activity across the beverage portfolio"
4338,"We also have a robust innovation pipeline to help fuel additional growth and we’ll begin to introduce new beverage products to the market, such as plant protein milk"
4339,We also plan to expand distribution of Garden Fresh Gourmet sauces and fresh soup
4340,"Finally, our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
4341,"Similar to other center store categories, sales declined"
4342,"Organic sales decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by soup and V8 beverages"
4343,Operating earnings increased 4%
4344,Let me start with our shelf stable beverage business
4345,Sales declined in the quarter
4346,"As we’ve discussed previously, the entire shelf stable beverage category has been hurt by ongoing consumer concerns about sugar and calories, and by consumer shopping the store perimeter for fresh juices and other functional beverages"
4347,"These trends continue to negatively impact our V8 portfolio, in particular, V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash"
4348,"However, V8 100% Vegetable Juice and V8 +Energy continue to meet the demands of consumers seeking beverages that deliver health and well-being benefit"
4349,"In the quarter, consumption of V8 Vegetable Juice increase behind our ongoing media investment, focused on our core baby boomer consumers and we expanded distribution of V8 +Energy"
4350,"Looking ahead, as discussed at our Investor Day, we have a clear strategy to improve performance of the V8 brand with continued focus on V8 Vegetable Juice, the revitalization of V8 Blends with new benefits focused messaging on the front of the label and steady growth V8 +Energy"
4351,"While our performance will improve, we do not expect this business to return to growth in fiscal 2018. Now let’s turn to soup"
4352,"As you know, this was a relatively small quarter for U.S"
4353,"While consumer takeaway was consistent with a year ago, soup sales declined 4%, all of which was related to lower retailer inventory levels"
4354,"For the year, U.S"
4355,"soup sales declined 1%, while sales of condensed soup and broth declined, I’m pleased with the growth of our ready-to-serve portfolio, including Chunky, Slow Kettle and the meaningful contribution from the successful mid-year launch of our new Well Yes! line"
4356,We’ve modified our outlook for 2018 in U.S
4357,"soup, since we spoke in July for sales, as we now expect additional headwinds, let me explain"
4358,"As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the retailer landscape is changing dramatically amidst intense competitive activity"
4359,"Each year, we enter a set of complex negotiations with our key retail partners"
4360,"Our goal is to drive growth, both for our customers and for Campbell"
4361,"Unfortunately, this year we’ve been unable to reach an agreement with a large customer on a promotional program for soup"
4362,We expect this will negatively impact our U.S
4363,"soup sales with this customer, particularly in the first-half Accordingly, we now expect our soup sales to decline in fiscal 2018. We are taking a number of steps to mitigate the profit risk, and of course, we’re continuing discussions with this customer to create a win-win solution"
4364,"We believe, our fiscal 2018 soup lineup and promotional programs are strong, and we’re pleased that, they’ve been well received in the balance of the marketplace"
4365,"For the upcoming soup season, we’ll build on the continued launch of Well Yes! Soup and introduced five new varieties"
4366,We have compelling brand partnerships with popular movie franchise to drive our kids’ soups
4367,We’re rolling out innovation in Swanson broth
4368,We have robust holiday plans across the portfolio
4369,"We’re launching the New Chunky Maxx line with 40% more protein, and we have strong integrated marketing, including a New Chunky campaign that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship"
4370,We’ll continue to work closely with all of our customers to maximize the sales opportunity during the upcoming soup season
4371,And now a quick update on the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods
4372,You may have seen recent media reports regarding a lawsuit involving the estate of one of the co-founders in Pacific
4373,Campbell is not named in the suit and we’re not going to comment on the litigation
4374,We remain enthusiastic about Pacific
4375,"It will add another purpose-driven brand, with a track record of growth to our portfolio"
4376,"We’re working to resolve outstanding issues, so that we may complete this transaction in the coming months"
4377,A highlight for fiscal 2017 was our successful multi-year cost savings initiative
4378,"As announced this year, we increased our target by $150 million and now expect to deliver $450 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to managing costs aggressively and reinvesting a portion of the savings back into the business in fiscal 2018 to position the company for long-term growth"
4379,"As we outlined in July, we’re focusing our investments on our four strategic imperatives, as we believe, these areas will be future growth drivers of our business"
4380,"First, as I mentioned earlier, we created a new e-commerce business unit to scale our capabilities across North America, including content creation, data analytics and forging new partnerships"
4381,"Expanding our e-commerce organization is critical to capture more than our fair share of the rapidly growing market for online grocery, which we expect to reach $66 billion annually by 2021. We’re in a good position to do so with experienced digital and e-commerce leadership in place and a solid strategy to develop new capabilities"
4382,"Second, we’re targeting increased investment in snacking, as consumers continue to seek new and better-for-you snacking options"
4383,The snacking market is worth approximately $125 billion in the U.S
4384,alone and growing around 3%
4385,We plan to invest in people and resources to expand our business beyond cookies and baked snacks to other snacking and mini meal categories
4386,"Third, we’ll continue to invest in our real food credentials in our core business; including adding more vegetables and whole grains; converting all our soups to chicken with no antibiotics, while continuing to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from our products and completing the removal of BPA from the lining of our cans in the U.S"
4387,and Canada
4388,"Finally, in the health and well-being space, we plan to invest across the company, focusing on food with attributes such as natural, organic, functional and fresh"
4389,"Additionally, for the longer-term, we’ll continue to fund Habit, our personalized nutrition start-up"
4390,"We’re applying the learnings from our successful beta test in San Francisco, as we expand the service nationally"
4391,We continue to expect multiple business models to emerge that ultimately will create value
4392,"These four strategic imperatives represent significant growth potential for Campbell, as we continue to differentiate our company and our brands over time"
4393,"The rapidly evolving marketplace requires new approaches and smart investment to engage with new and existing customers to make our brands more relevant to new generations of consumers, while satisfying our loyal core consumers and to explore new models of innovation"
4394,This longer-term view sometimes comes at the expense of shorter-term performance
4395,"We have our eye on the long-term targets, as we continue to believe that they are attainable"
4396,"However, to achieve them, we must further invest to diversify our portfolio towards the faster-growing consumer spaces of health and well-being and snacking, while increasing our participation in the growing e-commerce space"
4397,"And we must do this, while raising the bar on transparency and making our food more real and more sustainable"
4398,"Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect sales growth in both Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell’s Fresh"
4399,"However, we expect sales to decline in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
4400,"As I outlined earlier, U.S"
4401,soup sales will be negatively impacted by lower promotional support with a large customer
4402,"Additionally, we do not expect our V8 beverage business to grow in fiscal 2018. Given the difficult operating environment, the outlook for our Americas division and our plan to invest back in the business for the long-term, we expect net sales to change by minus 2% to 0%, adjusted EBIT to change by minus 1% to plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by 0% to plus 2%, this guidance excludes the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods"
4403,Anthony will walk you through additional details during his remarks
4404,"In closing, across the industry, the pace of change and disruption continues to accelerate"
4405,"We expect the operating environment to remain challenging in fiscal 2018. Campbell is prepared to address the short-term challenges we’re facing, and make the necessary investments to position the company for long-term growth"
4406,"Our purpose, growth agenda and strategic imperatives provide the guide as we take the steps to be the leading health and well-being food company"
4407,Thank you
4408,"And now I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro"
4409,"Good morning, Andrew"
4410,"Andrew, you raised a very good point and it’s always a very thoughtful process to balance the performance in the short-term with significant long-term investments"
4411,"In this environment and for the last several years, we have been acting very decisively and aggressively"
4412,"When you think about it, we bought five companies in the last five years"
4413,"If you include the pending acquisition of Pacific, we divested lower performing businesses"
4414,We have closed several manufacturing facilities and consolidated assets and giving – give – invested to give us much more flexibility and cost savings in our supply chain
4415,"We’ve realized our cost savings program over delivering the $300 million a year early and setting a goal for another $150 million, which we have a line of sight to"
4416,And we’ve really amped up new models of innovation going into places that we haven’t gone before
4417,So we haven’t been sitting still for a moment
4418,And this continued stream of investment is on top of all of that activity
4419,And we believe that the investments that we’re making really – are in sufficient support in 2018 to get these ideas jumpstarted and/or continue to invest where we have already been activating
4420,"And so I’m comfortable with the fact that, it’s the right level of investment and we’re still able to show some EPS and EBIT growth in the process"
4421,"Hi, Matt"
4422,"Yes, we don’t necessarily comment on the specifics with a customer, but let me answer the question more in aggregate"
4423,Our negotiations with customers for soup season involve joint business planning with plans for spending and merchandising linked to a sales goal
4424,"And what we seek are win-win-win solutions, win for the consumer, win for the customer and win for Campbell"
4425,"And so, in this particular situation, we were not able to achieve that negotiation"
4426,"And so what I can tell you though is, our programs are strong, our A&C investment is robust and our new products are really unique with the Well Yes! and Chunky Maxx"
4427,"And they’ve been really well received by customers in general in the marketplace, and we will continue to keep the dialogue open and strive for that win-win-win solution"
4428,"Yes, I think that the – again, as I said, I think the retailer environment right now is hypercompetitive"
4429,"I mean, you’ve got the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods, the expansion of Leadle and Aldie, creating some new retail formats and some escalated competition in the marketplace"
4430,"However, I’m optimistic that retail continues to morph"
4431,"I mean, I remember and I’m going way back when club stores and supercenters were a new format"
4432,And the retailer market and companies like ours adjust to that
4433,"So we’re really focused on making our brands accessible in multiple channels, and we believe that the new sales design that we have will help us in that effort"
4434,"So, yes, I do think these are challenging times"
4435,"And I do think that, as the consumer changes, retailers will change with the consumer and we’ve got to do the same"
4436,"Hello, Bryan"
4437,"So in the snacking area, I’ll take it in three parts"
4438,The first is our internal innovation
4439,And we have real insights about the frequency of consumer snacking and mini meal consumption now five times a day as opposed to only about a third of the population eating three square meals
4440,So we think that’s a very rich space for us to expand with our brands internally
4441,"So we have a concerted effort across the enterprise to really look at the – a series of platforms that we’ve identified and bring health and well-being more into the front and center on snacking, starting with mindful kids snacking, which we think is a good base for us"
4442,So the investment is really in the people and resources to amp up that internal innovation
4443,"The second part of it is partnerships, and we’re continuing to look at partnerships like Chef’d, for example, where we can actually incorporate our brands into new models and accessible channels"
4444,"And then the third would be, smart M&A"
4445,And we continue to be very disciplined about the M&A that we do and this will be no different
4446,"But this is an area, where we have an interest, particularly in the better-for-you snacking arena"
4447,"So it’s really a three-pronged approach, but we do believe that’s a very robust space for us as a company across the enterprise"
4448,"I think that’s built into the growth expectations for the Global Biscuits and Snacks Division, and some of the innovations that we will be developing will also be hitting the marketplace in future years"
4449,Thank you
4450,I’m comfortable that we’ve given you the information that we’re willing to disclose
4451,"So, beyond that, I don’t believe we should be talking about the details"
4452,"Yes, we have a very disciplined robust process with our customers in joint business planning, which starts with discovery of opportunities, development of ideas, decisions made and then delivery and execution"
4453,"And so, we have been working on these joint business plans for many years with many customers"
4454,"They really involve things like pricing merchandising shelves, performance, consumer activation, customization, packaging, product assortment, they’re very, very comprehensive strategic plans that we co-develop with our customers"
4455,And we have very strong programs this year and very robust plans with customers
4456,So I’m optimistic with this other one situation that we will get to a win-win solution
4457,"Hi, Jason"
4458,We’re not experiencing this in other categories
4459,We believe that we have the right balance of strengthening our core business and at the same time expanding into faster growing spaces
4460,"So, again, we believe that we are spending adequately and aggressively in our Global Biscuits and Snacks in our Campbell Fresh business to build those very on-trend categories"
4461,"Just a reminder, though, the soup business is still a very large and profitable business for us, and we have to keep our brands differentiated and relevant"
4462,"And so we’ve been really investing very specifically in the real food credentials of our core business to better satisfy consumers and customers and innovation to keep the center store robust, which is definitely needed in today’s environment"
4463,"We – that said, we have had really good margin expansion in the category and we’re operating as a company very profitably"
4464,"So, I do think that if there are M&A opportunities out there that we can bolt-on or supplement what we’re doing, we are open to that, but we’re again, very disciplined about our approach to that"
4465,"Hi, David"
4466,Private label has definitely been around for a long time and has traditionally been below average share in our categories
4467,And acknowledging the fact that we did feel the impact on Swanson broth this year
4468,We believe in a world of private label that the best insulation is brand differentiation and that’s where we’re focused
4469,"And so, and the other – the flip side of it is, in the Fresh business, we do participate with store brands in some of our fresh categories"
4470,So it’s not a one size fits all on how to work in an environment with private label
4471,"Yes, we have specific plans to differentiate broth this year"
4472,"Thank you, Gerald"
4473,"Overall, we are pleased with our progress this quarter with results in line with our expectations"
4474,"As in the last quarter, we were particularly pleased with growth in U.S"
4475,pharmacy volume and market share
4476,"During the quarter, we also completed the $1 billion share buyback program which we discussed on our last earnings call"
4477,"I'm also pleased that today, we have raised the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2017 by $0.08. So now let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter"
4478,"As we expected currency again had a negative impact, the U.S dollar being 12.5% stronger versus Sterling than in the comparable quarter last year"
4479,"Sales for the quarter were $30.1 billion, up 2.1% versus the comparable quarter"
4480,"On a constant currency basis, sales were up 5%"
4481,"GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1%"
4482,"GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 5.3% and diluted EPS was $1.07, up 5.9%"
4483,"Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, up 5.5% and in constant currency was up 7.5%"
4484,"Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 11.9% and in constant currency up 13.6%"
4485,These percentage increases were higher than for adjusted operating income
4486,"This was due to a lower tax rate, partially offset by losses on certain legacy investments which adversely impacted both earnings from other equity method investments and other income"
4487,"Since the quarter-end, we have disposed of the legacy investment, the gain on which will largely offset these losses"
4488,"The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate, excluding the adjusted equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 19.1%"
4489,This was lower than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to relatively high incremental discrete net tax benefits and a lower estimated core annual tax rate of 25.3%
4490,"All of this resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.33, up 12.7% and in constant currency up 14.4%"
4491,"For completeness, here are the numbers for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. I will not go through those in great detail, but you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $3.02, up 4.9% versus the same period a year-ago"
4492,"Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $3.79, up 7.7% and up 9.9% on a constant currency basis"
4493,So let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA
4494,"Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $22.5 billion, up 6.3% over the year-ago quarter"
4495,"This included two months of results from AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, a recently formed central specialty and mail services business"
4496,"Comparable store sales for the division increased by 3.7%, adjusted gross profit was $5.7 billion, down 0.5% reflecting a decrease in pharmacy, partially offset by an increase in retail"
4497,We'll look at this in more detail in a moment
4498,"Adjusted SG&A for the division was 18.7% of sales, an improvement of 1.7 percentage points"
4499,This improvement was primarily due to sales mix and higher sales as well as an amendment to certain employee postretirement benefits and our cost transformation program
4500,"Adjusted operating margin was 6.5% in line with the comparable quarter last year, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, up 5.9%"
4501,"So next, let's look in more detail at Pharmacy"
4502,"Pharmacy total sales were up 10.3% versus the year-ago quarter, mainly due to higher prescription volumes, including mail and central specialty"
4503,"During the quarter, we filled 255.2 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 8.5%"
4504,"On a comparable basis for stores, which exclude central specialty and mail, pharmacy sales increased by 5.8% with scripts filled up 8.3%"
4505,"In the second quarter, we reported our highest quarterly growth rate in over seven years"
4506,This quarter was even better
4507,Growth was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships
4508,"Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics"
4509,This pressure contributed to lower pharmacy gross profit and gross margin
4510,A higher proportion of specialty adversely impacted pharmacy gross margin by around 100 basis points
4511,"However, the higher specialty sales had a positive impact on gross profit"
4512,"Our reported retail prescriptions market share on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.5%, up by approximately 110 basis points over the year-ago quarter"
4513,This was the highest market share that we have ever reported
4514,Total retail sales were down 1.8% on the same quarter last year
4515,This included the impact of the previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations
4516,"Comparable retail sales were down 0.4% with declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness, and beauty categories"
4517,"Adjusted gross profit was higher, primarily due to mix and underlying margin improvement"
4518,"Beauty category performance and beauty differentiation stores continues to be markedly better than in other stores, supported by strong sales growth of No7 and Soap & Glory"
4519,"We have also continued to introduce new brands into our existing beauty differentiation locations, including Botanics, which I mentioned last quarter"
4520,"We remain on track to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar year"
4521,"This quarter as part of our strategy and ongoing cost transformation, we have also begun to implement a program in certain stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance"
4522,"This is designed to deliver a better experience for our customers, provide ongoing efficiencies, and reduce working capital"
4523,"In the coming months, we expect this program to reach approximately 1,500 stores"
4524,So now let's look at the results for the Retail Pharmacy International division
4525,"Sales for the division were $2.8 billion, down 0.2% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter"
4526,Comparable store sales increased 0.2% in constant currency
4527,"Comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.1% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to a decline in the UK"
4528,"In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.4%, mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding"
4529,"Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.4%, Boots UK’s comparable retail sales increasing 0.1%"
4530,"Within this, beauty was Boots UK’s strongest category, assisted by the launch of No7 Restore & Renew Face & Neck Multi-Action Serum"
4531,"Adjusted gross profit for the division at $1.1 billion was down 1.2% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, mainly due to lower pharmacy gross margin"
4532,"Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was 0.7 percentage points higher at 34%, mainly due to inflationary pressures and higher variable payroll costs"
4533,"Adjusted operating margin was 6.9%, down 1.1 percentage points in constant currency"
4534,"This resulted in adjusted operating income of $193 million, a decrease of 14% again in constant currency"
4535,"I am delighted to report that in April, the first Boots franchise store opened in South Korea"
4536,This is in line with our strategy of expanding Boots retail presence in Asia
4537,"South Korea is a highly sophisticated beauty market particularly for cosmetics, and it’s strategically important for sourcing innovative products"
4538,So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division
4539,"Sales for the division were $5.3 billion, up 2.7% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis"
4540,Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.7%
4541,"This was ahead of the Company's estimated market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with growth in emerging markets and the UK partially offset by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe"
4542,"Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.9% down 0.1 percentage points on a constant currency basis, but in line with the second quarter"
4543,"Adjusted operating income was $253 million, up 53.1% in constant currency"
4544,"Excluding adjusted equity earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 0.6% in constant currency"
4545,So turning next to capital allocation
4546,Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.9 billion
4547,"During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $502 million"
4548,This primarily reflected improvements in inventories both in the quarter and year-on-year
4549,Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $273 million
4550,We continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and U.S
4551,"beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we have previously talked about"
4552,"Overall, this resulted in free cash flow in the quarter of $1.6 billion with a total of $4.3 billion in the year to date"
4553,Turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We have raised the lower end of our guidance and now anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Remember this guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year
4554,I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments
4555,"Okay, I’ll try and take some of those in the right order"
4556,"If I start, perhaps, with just the tax, as I said in the prepared comments, the core tax rate was 25.3% and then this quarter if you look back historically, we had a relatively high number of discrete positives clearly very significantly quarter-by-quarter as you can see going back historically"
4557,"And as I say you can see this was a relatively high number, but I think in terms of the core tax rate and helping you with the model, the 25.3% that you see it today is clearly under U.S"
4558,GAAP or the rate that we would anticipate at this point for the core tax element for the full-year
4559,"Just in terms of buyback program, clearly, we've announced the program just today"
4560,"And I think – and just in thinking about modeling, clearly, we’re pretty well the end of June now, so we’ve really only got a couple of months to go to the year-end"
4561,"So there's not really long for any impact where we to choose to commence that program, any impact will be relatively modest"
4562,"Obviously, our guidance as ever is all in, but again as I said in the prepared comments it is of course assuming currency exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year"
4563,"I think in terms of the accretion, what we said is modest accretion in the first full-year and I think that's important to take away and we’re very clear on the synergies that we can deliver the $400 million over three to four years"
4564,We've got a very clear path to delivering it
4565,And I think one of our approaches to acquisition integration is one where we have very detailed plans
4566,"We take it in a very structured way, so that we do things smoothly"
4567,"We are going to be obviously – actually acquiring those stores over a period of time as we've explained in the announcement and then we will be rebranding those over time to Walgreens, bringing in the Walgreens offer"
4568,And that is not something that we would ever dream of actually big banging
4569,We need to do it properly so that we have the customer proposition is delivered in a consistent way as we do the rebranding
4570,"So we're very confident about the returns, but what's important is to go in a straight line and do in a way where we keep the focus on the customer as we integrate the business on the service that we provide our patients rather than sometimes which you see, dare I say, I see in other businesses do, where they rush things and they don't execute properly"
4571,"And I think you’ll have seen that consistently as with the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots, I think you'll see we've got a very clear track record of doing that over time"
4572,We've not published our long-term leverage target
4573,"We've chosen as you know Robert to talk about our commitment to solid investment grade and that’s very much what our policy as we've obviously because of the time is taken since the original announcement of the original Rite Aid transaction we've obviously been building up a lot of cash, which is not something that we like doing we're very committed to having an efficient balance sheet"
4574,"We have to do and that’s why today when we've announced the new transaction, we've been probably announced the $5 billion share buyback program"
4575,So we're very committed to being financially disciplined to when we're looking at M&A we’re always very focused on the numbers
4576,"If the numbers don't add up, don't give meet our investment hurdles then we're very disciplined, we don't do transactions and so we're very happy to grow organically and invest with to do M&A when we get the right returns, but equally a very clear policy of returning any surplus funds to shareholders within those parameters that I've explained, having an efficient balance sheet very important to us"
4577,"Yes, I think as I have said, go back to the point that is very promotional far too promotional"
4578,We don't think is good for us
4579,"It’s not good for customers, I mean don't think is actually good for suppliers either"
4580,So we believe much more net consumption driven model and that's where we’re heading to
4581,Also as customers change more and more new future will use personalization and digital marketing and more than the secular to understand what Walgreens can do for them
4582,And we've got a mature digital organization for retail that as you know and we're making moves no to really shift to spend over time in marketing and towards digital and personalization
4583,"So all these things are true John and is an evolution of the model and we're really accelerating it based on fact, based on data and we are really making strong moves in the next 18 months as Stefano said to do that"
4584,And then we have the systems coming in and Phase III to really sustain not move and accelerate to further
4585,So we've been running for two or three years we're very confident that we know the approach have to do
4586,I’m going to taking the steps to get on with it
4587,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone"
4588,Our new fiscal year is off to a terrific start
4589,"We delivered an outstanding financial performance in the first quarter, powered by multiple engines of growth across our business"
4590,"Both sales and earnings per share rose double-digits, and all of our regions and major categories advanced"
4591,"Our 13% constant currency sales increase exceeded our forecast, and we leveraged the incremental top line results into excellent earnings growth, aided by cost savings and efficiencies"
4592,"We accelerated the momentum that we experienced at the end of fiscal year 2017 by continuing to focus on fast growing brands, channels, and countries, and fueled these areas with additional resources and investments"
4593,"We targeted new consumers as we expanded our reach, especially with millennials, and they were drawn to our innovative, high-quality products"
4594,"More influencers' attention, sophisticated social media programs and a digital-first mindset across our brands helped drive our success"
4595,"With an encouraging start to the year and continued confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our full-year sales and EPS guidance"
4596,"In constant currency, we now expect our sales to rise 8% to 9% and earnings per share growth of 12% to 14% in fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are mindful of external geopolitical and economic issues that could pose challenges to our business"
4597,"Looking out our categories, makeup has been strong for several years and continued to be robust across many of our brands"
4598,Too Faced and BECCA contributed significantly along with Tom Ford and Estée Lauder
4599,"What stood out in this quarter, however, was our skin care performance which rebounded strongly, a trend we are seeing in the industry"
4600,"Our improvement stemmed from strength in existing products and successful recent launches from Estée Lauder, La Mer, and GLAMGLOW, as they captured many new consumers"
4601,"Our fragrance categories growth came largely from our luxury and our artisanal brands, which are gaining traction worldwide and have developed into a strong growth engine"
4602,Nearly all brands in our portfolio advanced globally
4603,"Our flagship Estée Lauder brand generated double-digit global growth with positive results in every region, led by particular strengths from Chinese consumers and global travelers"
4604,"Aligned with the company's strategy, Estée Lauder has developed multiple engines of growth across its categories, channels, and geographies"
4605,Much of the brand's momentum stemmed from an acceleration in skin care on top of continuous strength in makeup
4606,"This was reflected in the success of these powerful hero franchises, including the Advanced Night Repair and Re-Nutriv skin care collections and Double Wear and Pure Color makeup lines"
4607,"This marks Estée Lauder's fourth consecutive quarter of solid sales growth, in the last two quarters, up double-digits"
4608,"Our M·A·C brand grew modestly on a global basis, thanks to excellent gains in Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, where its business more than doubled"
4609,"Growth also came from travel retail, where its sales climbed double-digits"
4610,"M·A·C has successfully captured new consumers, helping to deliver sequential improvements also in North America"
4611,Our luxury brands continued to enjoy strong worldwide demand
4612,"La Mer, Jo Malone, Tom Ford each grew double-digits in every region"
4613,"And our newness brand are performing well, and we build their equities and broaden their reach to a targeted consumer base"
4614,"To stay in the lead in prestige beauty, we continued to successfully pivot to the high-growth channels, where more consumers are shopping"
4615,"Our sales in travel retail, specialty-multi and online each grew strong double-digits"
4616,"Sales gains in travel retail reflected higher passenger traffic, a greater number of Chinese travelers to Hong Kong and Macau, compelling offering and a wider exposure of some of mid-sized brands"
4617,All of our brands benefited from the positive trend
4618,"Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and La Mer were standouts while most of the portfolio had healthy gains, including Clinique, which rose sharply on strong demand for its moisturizers"
4619,All regions grew in travel retail
4620,Asia/Pacific led the growth with Chinese consumer traveling in greater numbers within Asia as well as to key tourist destinations in Europe
4621,"We continued rolling out some of our newer brands in major airports, including By Kilian or Le Labo"
4622,"For the fiscal year, we expect our travel retail business to remain robust based on expected strong passenger traffic growth, increased conversion of travelers into buyers and sustained demand for our products, particularly from emerging market consumers"
4623,We plan to invest more in China and other emerging markets this fiscal year to further build awareness and demand for our brands
4624,We should benefit consumption in both the local market and several travel corridors
4625,Our strong online business was led by third-party and retailer sites
4626,"Globally, our metrics improved across the board, including higher traffic, conversions, and orders"
4627,"We continued to garner new consumers throughout our business on Tmall in China, where our sales more than doubled, fueled in part by M·A·C's successful launch in May"
4628,"In the recent quarter, M·A·C also successfully launched on a large online platform in Southeast Asia owned by Alibaba called Lazada with a brand building distribution model similar to Tmall, where we control the look and the content of the virtual store"
4629,We expect to expand on the platform in more markets and with more brands starting this quarter
4630,We continue to broaden our global online footprint with new site launches and retailer distribution expansion
4631,"In the quarter, we added more than 100 sites"
4632,"The majority were retailers and most of them in the European region, demonstrating the scalability of our digital model"
4633,"Spurred by the growth of social media and technology advancement, mobile is the focus of our digital strategies"
4634,"In the recent quarter, mobile accounted for 70% of our global online traffic"
4635,"We are seeing the results of our investment in mobile, as it is an important factor driving first time digital consumers in emerging markets and increasing the frequency of purchases in more developed countries"
4636,We also continue to strengthen our position in specialty-multi retailers globally
4637,Many of our brands expanded their target reach as they pushed younger consumers drawn by the channel
4638,"M·A·C roll out in ULTA Beauty in North America has resonated strongly, as approximately half the consumer who purchased M·A·C products were new or lapsed users of the brand"
4639,M·A·C has become a best-selling makeup brand in the large majority of ULTA Beauty stores where it opened
4640,"And based on the strong initial performance, we plan to accelerate its expansion there"
4641,"By opening in more specialty-multi stores globally, M·A·C will continue to balance a meaningful presence in all major channels, department stores, freestanding stores, specialty-multi, online, and travel retail"
4642,"Internationally, we are strategically expanding our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, in the specialty-multi channel which is their primary distribution focus"
4643,We have entered certain European markets through Sephora and other retailers and are highly ranked
4644,Several brands are actively expanding in specialty-multi in Korea where sales has been excellent
4645,"For example, Clinique and Origins each added more than 50 doors of Olive Young"
4646,"Turning to our geographies, our sales in China soared"
4647,"Virtually all our brands there grew double-digits, while some, notably M·A·C, Tom Ford, and Lab Series, more than doubled"
4648,Our makeup business in total doubled for the second consecutive quarter while skin care accelerated
4649,Our luxury fragrance brands also performed beautiful
4650,"Our brands have strengthened our position with Chinese consumers, and our analytics show that much of this growth is coming from consumers new to our brands"
4651,"Our retail sales accelerated sequentially from last quarter, and importantly, we gained share"
4652,The surge in consumption for luxury beauty in China is due in part to stronger demand from millennials in lower prices as a result of import tax reductions which have given consumers more purchasing power
4653,We foresee continued strong interest in luxury products by Chinese consumers and plan to continue investing in the country
4654,"Hong Kong delivered strong gains as tourist traffic increased and local demand improved, contributing to increases across categories"
4655,More investment in digital and social media helped drive awareness
4656,We have been strengthening the portfolio of our newness brand by providing R&D and supply chain capabilities
4657,We are also identifying new distribution opportunities where we see strong consumer interest
4658,"As a result, we launched several of our new luxury fragrance brands in European flagship department stores that have significant tourist traffic"
4659,In the U.S
4660,", we are committed to collaborating with department stores to drive growth both in store and online by exciting consumers with product innovation and better services"
4661,"This quarter, our sales from many of the stores' online sites were robust, and although our business in brick-and-mortar continued to be challenged, we saw early signs of progress"
4662,"We are encouraged that our organic sales in North America department stores showed sequential improvement for the quarter, despite the impact of hurricanes that affected our business for several weeks in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico"
4663,"This speaks to the breadth and strength of our portfolio, as well to our channel mix"
4664,"On a more personal level, we are proud of the work that the company has done to help our affected employees and their families in the areas disrupted by the storms"
4665,Fueling our success across channels and geographies was an array of exciting products that captivated consumers
4666,"We continue to focus our innovation on our biggest franchises, striving to make our hero products in every brand even more valuable, introducing new products with an important franchise brings it more attention and increases sales across the key areas of our business"
4667,"Through effective social media, our brands are inspiring more trial of core product lines, which more often lead to repeat purchases and brand loyalty"
4668,"For example, Estée Lauder introduced a new eye serum under Advanced Night Repair line, the ANR Eye Concentrate Matrix"
4669,It was highly successful worldwide and helped drive sales of the entire franchise
4670,"Likewise, Clinique newest Moisture Surge product, a supercharged concentrate, boosted the collection and created the halo effect on the moisturizer's sub-category, which is a strategic focus area for Clinique"
4671,"Moisture Surge sales have increased significantly for the last two years globally and, in the recent quarter, rose more than 30% as retail in the U.S"
4672,Clinique plans to bolster the Moisture Surge franchise with additional products
4673,"As we promote our wide array of beauty products, we are focusing our marketing spending on digital to allow how consumers are seeking communications and information"
4674,Each of our brands has adopted a digital-first mind-set with an emphasis on mobile
4675,"With a tailored approach, each brand continuously decide which platforms and messages are most effective in reaching their target consumers"
4676,"Another important piece of our digital strategy is social media, especially the use of influencers, who have proven to help our brands standout"
4677,"The Estée Lauder brand recently named a new global beauty director, who is attracting younger consumer and collaborating on product development"
4678,"Clinique uses hundreds of local influencers all over the world, who promote its products in culturally-relevant ways"
4679,"Clinique China business was solid this quarter, due in part to improved consumer engagement"
4680,"Looking to the holiday season, we believe our compelling programs will drive traffic to stores and support our overall business"
4681,"Clinique has developed desirable sets that will be competitively positioned, while M·A·C's Snow Ball collection reflects current fashion trends"
4682,We continue to invest in capabilities and talent
4683,Our performance is the reflection of our terrific teams across the globe who were able to quickly pivot and execute change smoothly
4684,We continuously developed our bench strength to ensure that our business leaders are in the best positions to perform with excellence and advance our strategies
4685,"Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is enabling us to cut expenses, become more efficient, and create great leverage of our sales growth"
4686,This will allow us to invest more in best growth opportunities by also expanding our operating margin
4687,We are maintaining some flexibility to allocate further resources to our biggest opportunities with the potential to spur momentum
4688,"We plan to devote greater resources to our strongest growth engines; China, global digital commerce, product innovation, and travel retail, to advance our industry leadership and sustain our growth above global prestige beauty"
4689,"We are gratified to be starting this fiscal year on such a high note, which is a testament to our winning strategy, to the agility of our talent and to our execution capability"
4690,We are optimistic about our future and excited about the global opportunities that lies ahead while remaining mindful of potential macro risks
4691,Now I will turn the call over to Tracey
4692,Thank you
4693,"Wow, this is one question"
4694,"But yes, basically, prestige market we believe will continue to grow 4% to 5%"
4695,"In this moment, it's pretty solid"
4696,"The drivers of the global prestige market, frankly, are not changing, and they are the higher consumption of prestige from the millennial consumers"
4697,"The higher access to luxury and prestige businesses in emerging markets, particularly in China"
4698,"And the continuous – the higher level of usage, particularly on makeup, of the millennial consumers versus previous generations"
4699,The recent improvements of the trend is in skin care where the millennials are also entering more than skin care business
4700,"Now what is the consequence of us of this is frankly a better balance of the growth between makeup and skin care is favorable to us because our skin care margins are better than the overall makeup margins, but I want still to remind that, within makeup, there are certain categories like face or foundation, which are also very profitably like many other skin care categories"
4701,So it's a very good positive
4702,"In term of the impact of this trend on Too Faced and BECCA, makeup is growing"
4703,Now the new news is the acceleration of skin care
4704,"Frankly, I don't see any big issue with deceleration of makeup, also because makeup continues to grow internationally in a very strong way, and we are, in fact, deploying Too Faced and BECCA more internationally"
4705,"So what is our expectation for Too Faced and BECCA? Obviously, after we have finished to add them – when we will add them in the base, we plan to continue growing this brand double-digit and, as part of this, the internationalization of these two brands will be an important step"
4706,"And I just want to underline the point that we are working very closely to our department store partners to look for accelerating and finding a better way to attract higher traffics also in the brick-and-mortar malls – stores, and we see some promising signs that some of the activity we are testing and learning about has a stronger effect on consumers than what we have done in the last couple of years"
4707,So we will keep focusing on that
4708,But to Tracey's point is the balance (34:30) is being where the consumer is
4709,"And I want to underline where the consumer is, is more and more online"
4710,And so our strength online including our strength online with our department store partners is a big part of this mitigating impact of the change of traffic in the country
4711,"No, GLAMGLOW is doing extremely well"
4712,It's continued to grow in the U.S
4713,"and is expanding internationally, is, in this moment, very successful in the U.K"
4714,", for example, and is expanding in other markets"
4715,The target that we are hitting is the younger consumer
4716,So millennials really like GLAMGLOW
4717,"The strength of the GLAMGLOW, in this moment, skin care proposition, are several, but two standouts in my opinion"
4718,"One is that the glow overall promise of the entire brand, the benefit of glowing skin is one of the most desirable benefits in the market in this moment and, importantly, is the most desirable benefit for younger skins, which is behind a lot of the growth we are seeing in skin care around the world, which is driven by that target group"
4719,"The second strength is the fact that this brand is focused on masks, and masks is the fastest-growing product category in skin care in this moment in most of the global regions"
4720,"And third is that this brand is, as you said in your question, expanding into other categories beyond masks"
4721,And every single very careful decision we have taken to expand the category is working and is giving great results
4722,It is coherent from a consumer standpoint
4723,"And finally, as I already said, the internationalization of the opportunity"
4724,"So again, a good acquisition, a good promising start of the acceleration of this brand, and a lot still do to in the next years to make this brand one of our mid-size and then one day very big brands in our portfolio"
4725,So our online business is still growing very strong
4726,We were up 33% in quarter one
4727,"And our online by now represent about 11% of total sales now globally, but the penetration is much higher than 11% in some of the top markets where online is very strong"
4728,We are growing our online business this quarter in general in our estimate for the year
4729,"We have growth in our brand dot-com, in our retail dot-com, and in platforms"
4730,So all the three segments are growing very strongly
4731,"This quarter, particularly brand dot-com remain very strong, but we saw a tremendous acceleration of platforms, namely Tmall"
4732,"And as we said in the prepared remarks, the beginning of our investment in Lazada in Southeast Asia"
4733,And we saw amazing progress in retail dot-com across the world
4734,So growth in department store retail dot-com in the U.S
4735,", growth in the specialty-multi retail dot-com and growth in many retail dot-coms around the world"
4736,"Actually, the exception is China where in China is now retail dot-com driven but is Tmall driving the growth"
4737,"So very strong and, as we said also in the prepared remark, clearly scalable"
4738,"We have opened 100 sites just this quarter in a very efficient way, scalable and agile, meaning where we see it works, we can invest more"
4739,"Where it doesn't work, we can smoothly change and revise and review what we're doing"
4740,"On the other two questions, so the short answer, and then I'll give you more detail, is that we believe that a double-digit growth is sustainable"
4741,"Now, the 50%, 40% are – may happen again by quarter depending on volatility, but I could not define (47:17) them as sustainable model, obviously"
4742,The double-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in retail over the long run should be sustainable trends
4743,Let me go one by one
4744,"In China, we are seeing, in this moment, an amazing results, but also in like-door we have 33%"
4745,"And that's super strong, we are growing market share"
4746,"And interesting, this quarter we saw these amazing results without increasing the number of cities, but just increasing the number of doors in the cities where we need to be more penetrated, where we need to put more brands"
4747,"So it's about more establishing our strengths rather than further expanding the number of cities this quarter, which, again, shows the power of online in city – in China, where the cities where we're not expanding brick-and-mortar yet, because it's not yet efficient, we still can reach the city with online"
4748,"So the model is pretty interesting, pretty sustainable, and has power"
4749,"The second thing I would like to say on China, the market continued to grow"
4750,"So we are growing above the market and building market share, but the market was about 30% growth, so very strong"
4751,It's about new consumer
4752,"It's about new access, as I said in my prepared remarks"
4753,"The other important thing in China is we are growing in every single channel in China: department stores, Sephora, freestanding stores, online"
4754,They're all growing double-digits
4755,So there is a really well spread
4756,"And then in every brand in our portfolio, we are growing"
4757,We are growing in makeup
4758,We are growing in skin care
4759,We are growing in fragrance
4760,"So it's broad growth, and so it's sustainable, in our opinion, on a more or less double-digit trend"
4761,"On travel retail, travel retail has been very strong"
4762,"We have seen this quarter an acceleration of travel retail in the retail – at retail levels, so a retail acceleration"
4763,"And this is driven by trends which are sustainable, some trends are the market, meaning the traffic of travelers is very solid"
4764,But a lot of what's happened is driven by us
4765,"One is about conversion, meaning today we estimate that 15%, depending on airport region, of people entering in airport shop anything"
4766,"So it's just driving the conversion from travelers to shoppers is an enormous opportunity to continuous traffic growth, and this isn't the end of the brands because this has a lot to do with investments we do in the current (49:45) or in the market of all regions"
4767,"So the fact that we are investing more in China, we are investing more in Brazil, we are investing more in Russia, et cetera, this is the reason why our countries in travel retail is working better and better, because our conversion in travel retail thanks to the marketing work that our teams do in every one of these countries is working better and better thanks to the assortment we choose in these places is getting better and better"
4768,"So it's not only about traffic, it's about what we do and what we invest in every single country"
4769,And that's why we believe that this is sustainable of more or less a double-digit trend in the long term
4770,The other reason why it's sustainable is very broad
4771,"As I explained, it's not only Asia"
4772,"We grew in travel retail in EMEA, in Latin America, in the U.S"
4773,"Obviously Asia has been particularly strong, but it's broad-based the growth that we see in this moment"
4774,"And we have developed a strategy where we really can follow the consumer across traveling corridors, and we can make sure also our innovation speaks to them in a coherent way between current country or regions (50:56) where they travel"
4775,"And so, in summary, strong and sustainable, but not at the levels we have seen this quarter"
4776,"Skin care – and now, Tracey, please add any perspectives"
4777,Skin care has strong margins structurally in our business
4778,"However, when there is a beat of skin care sales where the extra skin care sales versus our original forecast comes without a lot of expenses, this margin gets boosted in the short term"
4779,"So I will not consider the quarter one margins as sustainable, but definitely we can count on stronger than average skin care margins in the future for the growth of skin care"
4780,"And in terms of millennials, the millennials are obviously getting more and more in skin care in what I define in summary, instant benefits"
4781,"Before I was speaking about GLAMGLOW and the glow benefit, there are other benefits which are instant, which is about preparing the skin for makeup, is about benefits for the day"
4782,"So not only traditional anti-aging but instant benefit for the skin are very popular with millennials around the world, and this will continue also because we are driving it and, frankly, the industry is driving that"
4783,So I believe this can be an interesting medium-term trend
4784,Tracey?
4785,"No, frankly, this is the number that we see, we estimate for the year"
4786,"Now, could be more 5% than 4%, absolutely, this first quarter was very solid"
4787,But you need to look at the – this is a global estimate
4788,Now the retail in the U.S
4789,is not super strong
4790,The retail in Continental Europe is not super strong
4791,is softening in term of market
4792,The Latin America market is not super strong
4793,"So what you see today is actually an acceleration in Asia, absolutely"
4794,But you don't see in terms of total market every single region accelerated
4795,"So in total, with plus and minus, we still believe a 4% to 5%, probably more in the 5% area is what we see today"
4796,"Which bring me to the second point that is, yes, we – I cannot speak for our competitors but from the number I see, I would agree with you, the big three are strong and are delivering market share growth overall, and we definitely are"
4797,We are growing market share in a significant way
4798,And I think this is explainable in many ways but one way maybe I want to add as far Estée Lauder Company are concerned
4799,"The big amount of the small brands and new launches, innovation that's happening in the market has created a much more competitive trial environment, meaning consumer buying new products, try new products, being able to access many more new products"
4800,But repurchase is continued to be driven by high-quality products at brand they trust
4801,"So while the trial game is more competitive, the repurchase game is still in the hands of the hero franchises, the big brands, and these brands continue to deliver very strong repurchase"
4802,"Remember, a lot of the profitability is in repurchase because trial, most of the time, is an investment"
4803,"And so what you see is the power of product quality, the power of prestige experiences into play, and that in this very competitive market out there, still strong brands, great quality products, and fundamental superior experiences remain the reason for success"
4804,"So M·A·C North America, specifically, as we said, is continuing to decline in the brick-and-mortar part of the business, meaning the department stores and our freestanding stores, and had a tremendous acceleration online and is performing very well in ULTA – in the store of ULTA as we had explained"
4805,So that's the mix
4806,"So in total, there is a sequential improvement of the trend of the brand"
4807,"Also, the innovation of M·A·C is planned to improve gradually across the fiscal year to be more in tune for the key trends in the United States of what has been in the past"
4808,"So our expectation is that the brands, in total, will stabilize over time thanks to the distribution balance, the drive of online, the improved innovation program, and having then in the base the periods that the brand had in the last year"
4809,So this gradually will put the brand in a condition to stabilize and then in the longer term grow again
4810,"As I said, in many other markets of the world, the brand is flying, and in China even doubling"
4811,"So, in total, we continue to expect the brand to have the power to grow"
4812,"But in North America, this will take a little bit of time to stabilize"
4813,"Good morning, everyone"
4814,Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter
4815,"Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.45, down from the $0.59 in the prior-year quarter"
4816,"Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $541 million, down $109 million from the year-ago quarter"
4817,"The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13%, compared to our forecasted annual tax rate of approximately 28%, due primarily to the effect of certain favorable discrete items, including return to provision and a favorable outcome of a tax position related to an acquisition, partially offset by changes in the forecasted geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and shift to higher tax jurisdictions"
4818,"Our trailing four-quarter-average ROIC of 6.4% is 60 basis points higher than the same period last year and 40 basis points above our 2017 annual WACC of 6.0%, thus generating positive EVA of $98 million on a four-quarter-trailing-average basis"
4819,"On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.45 per share"
4820,"For this quarter, we had $0.12 per share charge related to asset impairments and restructuring activities, and a $0.02 per share net gain on the sales of assets and businesses, and a $0.01 per share loss on debt extinguishment"
4821,Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line
4822,"Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the corporate items affecting our quarterly results"
4823,"In the corporate line, net interest expense was relatively flat at $72 million versus last year"
4824,"Looking ahead, we're continuing to project net interest expense of approximately $320 million for the full-year 2017, consistent with what we indicated at the beginning of the year"
4825,Unallocated corporate costs of $109 million were up slightly versus the prior year and below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017 on lower spending for special projects and reduced employment and benefit costs
4826,Minority interest and other charges increased by $9 million
4827,"Turning to our cash flow statement for the first six months – first nine months on slide 6, we generated $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes, similar to the prior year"
4828,We had favorable changes in the working capital of a bit over $500 million
4829,Total capital spending was about $700 million
4830,Our current expectation for fiscal year 2017 is capital spending of approximately $1 billion
4831,"Acquisitions to-date of $187 million were primarily related to Crosswind Industries, a pet treat manufacturer; and Chamtor, a French producer of wheat-based sweeteners and starches"
4832,"We spent almost $700 million to repurchase shares, and including dividends, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first nine months"
4833,"Our average share count for the quarter was 569 million diluted shares outstanding, down 20 million from the same period one year ago"
4834,"At the end of the quarter, we had 566 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis"
4835,Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30. Our balance sheet remains solid
4836,Our operating working capital of $7.2 billion was down slightly from a year-ago period
4837,"Total debt was about $7.3 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.6 billion"
4838,Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%
4839,Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was similar to the level last year
4840,We had $4.8 billion available global credit capacity at the end of June
4841,"If you add available cash, we'd access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity"
4842,"Next, Juan, will take us through a review of business performance"
4843,"Good morning, David"
4844,"Good morning, Adam"
4845,"Good morning, Ken"
4846,"Ken, it's Ray here"
4847,"I mean, clearly, there is capacity coming online, but that's also a little bit of recognition that there is global protein growth around the world"
4848,"I mean, you look at the trends, like 4% to 5% growth in terms of meal demand and protein demand"
4849,"From our perspective, I mean, some of the recent – the quarter's results, they've been impacted by other factors"
4850,"I mean, clearly, when we take a look at our results in Q3, for Oilseeds, we've seen that as an example, a lot of pressure in terms of the South American crop, impacting particularly the European operations"
4851,A lot of meal actually from Argentina went over to Europe and actually caused us to have one of our lowest quarters from a crush perspective over in Europe
4852,"We actually think that, over time, will equalize itself"
4853,We actually think production levels will adjust in order to take that into account
4854,"We've also seen, for example, on the Oilseeds results, part of it is just due to the simply South American origination"
4855,"We actually entered the third quarter be more optimistic, regarding farmer commercialization"
4856,"In fact, at the time of the last earnings call, we're actually seeing some good movements in terms of the crops"
4857,"But what happened was the currency actually moved the other way as we moved through August, and then the farmers actually just really slowed down commercialization"
4858,And that really resulted in our South America results being a lot lower than what we had thought
4859,"We also – in the case of Wilmar, I mean, they had a good quarter, but it's clearly below our own internal expectations, and it was about a $35 million impact versus our own internal expectations"
4860,"So I think, Ken, when we look at the quarter, I think that there's certain factors that clearly impacted us"
4861,"It doesn't really change our longer-term perspective on oilseeds, which is really demand continues to be robust for protein"
4862,"We're seeing China continue to be very, very strong in terms of demand side"
4863,"We do believe that while there are some capacity additions, we actually think that's going to be limited in some respects as the market really adjust to the crush margin levels"
4864,And I think we actually get to a level whereby there's going to be a better balance and we're going to see industry margins actually recover in the crush business
4865,Yeah
4866,I mean in Mexico as you probably have heard for – the government is actually looking towards introducing more ethanol into the market
4867,"There's about three cities that they're not looking to put it right now, but outside those three cities, they're looking actually to actually bring in additional ethanol blends up to 10% in those areas there"
4868,"So, we're rather encouraged that we should see incremental growth in that area"
4869,"I know there has been some talk regarding some injunctions out there, but we think that's going to get sorted out"
4870,"We do believe, for example, Mexico, is one of these markets whereby vehicle sales will continue to grow"
4871,"And so, basically, consumption is going to grow in Mexico, and given the pollution considerations in Mexico, we believe ethanol is actually a fairly clean fuel that will actually help them address some of their pollution issues"
4872,I think it's about a couple hundred million gallons
4873,"I mean, I think that's what we're thinking about right now"
4874,"Morning, Heather"
4875,"Well, I just think that with the RVOs, I mean we're talking about, again, 15 billion gallons in the case of ethanol here"
4876,We're seeing the U.S
4877,"It continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate, but it continues to grow"
4878,"On the export side, looking at next year, we're probably looking for some modest growth versus, say, the 1.3 billion gallons that we're seeing this year, 2017. So we could be up to about 1.4 billion gallons"
4879,"And then there's upside, in terms of some other markets that will develop, such as Mexico"
4880,"And as Juan even indicated, in the case of China, they may decide to open up bringing in ethanol as opposed to growing corn using their water in order to make their own ethanol"
4881,"So like over time, we do see total demand for U.S"
4882,ethanol continue to move up over the medium term compared to kind of where we are at this point in time
4883,"I mean, I think that, again, looking at domestic gasoline demand, currently about 14.4 billion gallon in terms of the ethanol blend, that's probably going to move up to 14.6 billion gallons next year"
4884,"So therefore, I mean, the demand side is moving up towards the 15 billion gallon level, which would be the mandate in 2018. So, we do believe that there is growth in the domestic market"
4885,It will be approaching the 15 billion gallon
4886,It'll necessarily need to have like some of the biodiesel in order to trying to meet that particular – those RVOs there
4887,"Good morning, Eric"
4888,"So, just maybe some perspectives on the third quarter"
4889,"First of all, you're right"
4890,"I mean, it's actually a favorable environment for us to have ownership"
4891,"And when you actually take a look at our inventory levels, they actually went up"
4892,"So, we actually did have good ownership in order to take advantage of carries"
4893,"Now, our total working capital did not go up because we actually managed the rest of the working capital, and some receivables and payables very, very effectively to offset the increase in terms of ownership that we had on the inventory side"
4894,"The other aspects of Ag Services in the third quarter was – I mean, clearly it was below our expectation and part of it's just due to the fact that just handling volumes were actually down during the quarter versus our initial expectations"
4895,"In fact, handling volumes were about down 20% versus where we thought we would be"
4896,And with lower volumes that had impact on our margins
4897,"And so, our average margins versus where we thought we would be were about 50% lower in the U.S"
4898,because a lot of it is volume-driven
4899,The other factor is like in global trade
4900,"I mean, we had a very good quarter in global trade, but we kind of had a one-off item here in the sense that we had some hedges on some Black Sea sales on both corn and wheat"
4901,We hedged it off some North American exchanges and there was kind of like a lack of correlation between the hedge and the underlying movement
4902,"And that was about like – that was over $20 million impact for us, which is within the quarter here"
4903,"So, but as we kind of look forward, we do have good ownership, there are carries in the market"
4904,"We know our volumes are going to be moving up in the fourth quarter, both in terms of soybean handling and even in the case of corn, we're actually starting to see U.S"
4905,corn becoming more competitive in December now
4906,So that's going to be a positive story for us and that's what gives us more confidence
4907,"And frankly, we also have more visibility in terms of our look, looking into the last two months of this year than we had in terms of visibility of looking into August and September at the time of our second quarter earnings call"
4908,So that's what gives us more confidence in terms of Ag Services for our fourth quarter in terms of an improvement versus kind of what we're seeing right now
4909,"I mean, looking at 2018, again it's still early into 2018, but we do believe that our strong ownership position will carry into the new year"
4910,"And frankly, we're still seeing great global demand"
4911,And so that should translate into some good numbers
4912,"We're seeing stocks-to-use ratios maybe stabilizing, maybe coming down"
4913,"So, that could also point towards the situation where the markets may actually start normalizing a little bit and provide us with more opportunities in order to merchandise"
4914,Good morning to all of you on the phone and the webcast
4915,"And I apologize for my voice, as I'm fighting a head and chest cold"
4916,"In 2016, we made progress against our strategic plans that strengthened our business model and positions the company for future growth"
4917,"Our productivity and cost savings initiatives drove EBIT margin expansion in full year EPS growth of 7%, the midpoint of our long-term target"
4918,"And we continue to generate solid operating cash flow, about $1 billion in 2016, which gives us a lot of financial flexibility"
4919,"Looking at marketplace performance, our core U.S"
4920,", CMG and snacks business progressed as we anticipated"
4921,"Retail takeaway and market share performance in the second half of the year was better than the first half of the year, which was impacted by shorter Easter and merchandising and display strategies at select customers"
4922,This resulted in full-year snacking market share growth of about 10 basis points
4923,We also began a strategic review of our global cost structure that should result in solid margin expansion and EPS growth
4924,We look forward to talking about our business in these plans in more details on the March 1 at our investor update
4925,Let me now provide you with some detail on our fourth quarter results
4926,"Net sales and marketplace performance, both retail takeaway and market share, were relatively in line with expectations"
4927,"Operating income and earnings per share diluted exceeded our forecast, driven by the early implementation of some cost savings efficiencies and a lower-than-expected tax rate"
4928,Patricia will provide you with more details on this in just a bit
4929,"As we anticipated, U.S"
4930,marketplace performance sequentially improved
4931,Total Hershey U.S
4932,"retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended December 31, 2016, within the xAOC+C channels increased 2.2%"
4933,"This represents all Hershey snack products sold at retail such as candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, Krave and snack bars"
4934,"Importantly, Hershey's U.S"
4935,"CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, retail takeaway increased more than three times the rate of the category, driven by chocolate and was up 1.9%"
4936,Our fourth quarter U.S
4937,"chocolate performance was solid with retail takeaway up 2.9%, resulting in a chocolate market share gain of 0.9 points"
4938,"Despite the slow start to 2016, we gained 0.4 points of chocolate market share for the full year"
4939,Our brands responded positively to the investments we discussed in July and October
4940,"Reese's, our biggest brand, continued to gain momentum driven by variety, news, core two-cup advertising and in-store merchandising and display"
4941,"The Reese's Pieces Cup innovation, NCAA football, in-store merchandising and strong Halloween and holiday performance generated retail takeaway of 7.2% this quarter"
4942,"Results were similar to last quarter and impressive, given that this is nearly a $2 billion brand at retail"
4943,"In 2017, we'll look to expand and improve upon our NCAA basketball and football relationship via innovation and targeted 360-degree activation programs given the customizable promotional entitlements available to us with this sponsorship"
4944,We were also pleased with the Kit Kat franchise
4945,"Fourth quarter and full year retail takeaway of 5.5% was about the same for both periods, driven by the success of the Big Kat new product launch, as well as the core Kit Kat instant consumable item that benefited from TV and digital marketing programs such as Chance the Rapper and Kit Kat thief"
4946,"In 2017, we'll continue to bring variety and news to the brand with limited edition red velvet flavor for Valentine's Day"
4947,"The wafer sticks are not red like the classic southern cake, but the candy itself is red velvet flavored and coated in white cream"
4948,"In the first half of 2016, The Hershey mega brand campaign didn't work as hard for us as we anticipated"
4949,"However, in the second half of the year, results improved driven by Olympics, S'mores and seasonal programming"
4950,"In the fourth quarter, Hershey's franchise retail takeaway increased low single digits on a percentage basis versus last year"
4951,"The launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch is underway, and we believe this will reenergize the brand"
4952,"While early results are encouraging, distribution continues to build and advertising is scheduled to begin in early February"
4953,"As we previously have mentioned, our consumer demand for multi-textural eating experiences across various snacking occasions is increasing, and this product fills a white space opportunity"
4954,You'll see additional innovation in the marketplace this year that also delivers on a textural experience in Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup and Hershey's and Reese's Crunchers
4955,"Our consumer research has indicated that millennials want new flavors and textures, especially the Reese's consumers"
4956,"Reese's is the fastest growing largest instant consumable franchise, so we do a lot of work here trying to bring the right level of investment to the core two-cup and variety news to the brand"
4957,"In 2017, we'll launch Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup in an instant consumable pack type"
4958,"Within the cup are cookie bits versus a solid cookie, which consumers told us was less intrusive in terms of texture"
4959,"The result is a product that delivers on all the sensations consumers want: smooth, creamy, sweet and crunchy"
4960,"And the Crunchers product line is targeted for that shareable snacking hand-to-mouth occasion, leveraging the appeal of sweet and texturally complex snacking"
4961,"These light, crispy and crunchy combinations are a perfect bite-sized snack for a different and unique eating experience"
4962,"So, we're making progress, but there's still a lot of work to do"
4963,We're not satisfied with our non-chocolate candy
4964,"In Brookside performance, the work is underway to improve their trends"
4965,"Although it will be a multi-step process, we continue to believe that candy, mint and gum is an attractive category capable of solid growth over the long-term, when supported with the right mix of customer and consumer marketing"
4966,"Now for an update on our international markets, where fourth quarter net sales growth was relatively in line with our expectations and up about 3% on a constant currency basis versus last year"
4967,"I was particularly pleased with Mexico and Brazil, where we generated solid constant currency net sales growth"
4968,"In Brazil, our growth was fueled by distribution gains in core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark bars, which was launched in Q3. As a result, in Q4, market share increased 0.5 points"
4969,"And in our Mexican business, chocolates, spicy sugar, confectionery and drinks are tracking relatively in line with our initial plans"
4970,"Our marketplace performance improved in the fourth quarter, with chocolate retail takeaway up about 9.5%"
4971,"And our traditional trade initiative with Sigma is progressing, and we're gaining chocolate momentum driven by Kisses"
4972,"Net sales in India, driven by the brands we're investing behind, Hershey's branded syrup, spreads and milk booster, as well as JOLLY RANCHER and Sofit, increased about 25%"
4973,"Late in the fourth quarter, we launched Brookside, primarily in the modern trade where we don't expect much of an impact from demonetization"
4974,"While small, this launch gives us exposure to a value-added segment with above average margins for the India business"
4975,"In China, the modern trade hypermarket environment continues to be challenging across many categories"
4976,"In Q4, China chocolate category sales declined about 4%, the same rate as the second and third quarter declines"
4977,"Our Q4 net sales in China declined about 11% on constant currency basis, slightly lower than our estimate"
4978,"Sell-in related to Chinese New Year drove Q4 net sales, and advertising and in-store programming occurred just as we had planned"
4979,"Our e-commerce business continues to progress, and our market share here is estimated to be greater than our share in brick and mortar"
4980,"Now, I'd like to pause briefly here to just say thank you"
4981,It's been an honor to lead The Hershey Company and these quarterly conference calls as Chairman and CEO
4982,I'm so proud of our company and what we've accomplished
4983,"I've always appreciated the questions and feedback we've received on these conference calls, and in all of the various meetings that we've participated in with you"
4984,"I've shared many of your thought-provoking questions and insights with my team, and I feel it's made me a better leader and Hershey a better company, so I say thank you"
4985,"And now, I'm proud to turn the call over to Michele Buck"
4986,"As we announced in December, Michele will become Hershey's 12th CEO on March 1, and I'm pleased to be staying on as Chairman"
4987,"I know that many of you have met Michele and know her, and agree that she's an experienced executive with excellent operating, marketing and strategic capabilities"
4988,"Now, let me turn the balance of the call over to Michele"
4989,"Thank you, Andrew"
4990,Yeah
4991,"I mean, we give the volume breakout in North America Josh"
4992,"So, if you were to look at North America, the volume and subtracted the takeaway, I mean, it's not perfect math, but it would get you to how we thought about it in the fourth quarter in December"
4993,Right in line with what we thought
4994,"So, as we've talked, the first quarter should really drive a lot of the growth"
4995,"I think if you look at the sales, first half, second half will be quasi similar, although the first half will be driven by the first quarter"
4996,"We had a lot of, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings in the second half of 2016. So, again, if you were to think of EPS growth probably more first half, first quarter driven"
4997,"Hey, David, I'll give you a macro comment and then Michele can follow up if she wants"
4998,I was at FMI last week
4999,"And one of the things that seemed to be pretty broad based across a number of retailers, and as I was hearing comments across manufacturers is that people were optimistic in terms of their plans, and I felt as though people were looking to really invest in their business from a merchandising standpoint and promotion"
5000,I'm really speaking about retailers as they were talking to us as well as others
5001,"And so, I felt really good that people really wanted to go out and execute against good plans"
5002,"It didn't feel quite as conservative, I would say, as it did the previous year"
5003,"So, I just took that as a fairly optimistic tone that people see their destiny as in their hands, and they're going to go execute against their business"
5004,"And I don't know, Michele, if you want to add to that?"
5005,"Well, Rob, we'll talk to a lot of this on March 1, especially some more detail around what some of these IT investments are at the business level, to ensure people are working most efficiently as possible, as well as at the corporate level"
5006,"So, I think you're going to see a little bit of both"
5007,"I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves on March 1 here, but there's a lot of things in the market changing very faster than they ever have before, and we're trying to bring solutions to retailers and be where the customer is going"
5008,"So, I think you'll see more of this on March 1."
5009,"Thanks, Juan"
5010,Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter
5011,"Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, up from the $0.42 last year"
5012,"Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $678 million, up $105 million from the year-ago quarter"
5013,The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26% compared to 25% in the first quarter of the prior year
5014,The slight increase in our tax rate is primarily due to the expiration of U.S
5015,"tax credits including the biodiesel tax credit, partially offset by changes in the forecast geographic mix of earnings"
5016,Our trailing four-quarter-average adjusted ROIC of 6.4% is unchanged from the end of the first quarter last year
5017,"Our ROIC has continued to improve for the third consecutive quarter following the challenging operating conditions that we experienced during the first half of 2016. For 2017, we have established our annual weighted average cost of capital at 6.0% following a detailed review of interest rates, equity risk premiums and betas in our cost of capital model"
5018,"Similarly, our long-term WACC has been updated to 7.0% based upon our review of assumptions and benchmarks"
5019,"On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a, reported quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share"
5020,"For this quarter, we had a $0.01 per share charge related to asset impairments and restructurings; a $0.01 per share LIFO gain; and certain discrete tax items of $0.01 per share"
5021,Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line
5022,"In Ag Services, we had approximately $7 million in impairment and restructuring charges primarily related to our restructuring efforts in the global trade desk"
5023,"In Corn and Oilseeds, we had small impairments and restructuring charges"
5024,"In the Corporate Lines, net interest expense was up approximately $11 million due to higher short-term interest rates and our overall mix of short- and long-term debt the following the issuance of new fixed rate debt in August of last year"
5025,"Unallocated corporate of $132 million was up versus the prior year due to a higher people cost, including benefit accruals as well as our increased investments in innovation, IT and business transformation, yet modestly below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017 that we provided at the last earnings call"
5026,"Minority interest and other charges improved to $20 million, primarily due to improved results from our equity investment in CIP"
5027,"Turning to the cash flow statement on slide 6, we generate about $508 million from operations before working capital changes during the period, down slightly from the prior-year period"
5028,"Total capital spending for the period was $200 million, about similar to the prior year"
5029,"Acquisitions of $90 million in the first quarter were primarily related to Crosswind Industries, a pet treat manufacturer"
5030,"The other investing activities line up the cash flow statement includes the incremental investments we made in Wilmar, bringing our total ownership stake to approximately 24.3%"
5031,"During the quarter, we spent about $248 million to repurchase shares, consistent with our prior guidance of $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the year subject to strategic capital requirements"
5032,"Our average share count for the quarter is 579 million diluted shares outstanding, down 18 million from the time one year ago"
5033,"At the end of the quarter, we had 577 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis"
5034,"Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was more than $400 million for the quarter"
5035,"Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. In summary, our balance sheet remains strong"
5036,Our operating working capital of $7.4 billion was down $280 million from the year-ago period
5037,"Total debt was $7.2 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $6.5 billion"
5038,Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%
5039,"Our shareholders' equity of $17.1 billion was slightly down from the $17.9 billion level last year, due to returns of capital and changes in the cumulative translation account"
5040,We had $5.1 billion global credit capacity at the end of March
5041,"If you add available cash, we had access to $5.8 billion of short-term liquidity"
5042,"Next, Juan will take us through a review of business performance"
5043,"Good morning, David"
5044,"Good morning, Farha"
5045,"Farha, if you recall last year, 2016, two major factors dragged down Oilseeds results"
5046,"One, the Wilmar equity earnings; and two, the lack of volumes in South America in terms of origination"
5047,"Now, those two factors, as we look into 2017, should not be negative factors"
5048,And you've seen the strength in terms of the Wilmar equity earnings that translate into our results in the first quarter
5049,"And then with the large crop in Brazil, particularly what's expected to be a significantly improved corn crop, origination volumes in South America should be significantly higher, which will contribute towards an overall positive delta in 2017 versus 2016. So again, we expect 2017 to be a lot better than 2016. Again, we don't expect it to approach the 2015 levels"
5050,"But nevertheless, 2017 for Oilseeds will be a far better year than 2016."
5051,"Morning, Eric"
5052,I think 1 million tonnes
5053,"Yeah, and we are seeing this year an extra 10%, that's as of first quarter growing"
5054,"So that's kind of the pace, if you will"
5055,"To the extent that it's adding cost, it's adding cost that is included in this $8 to $10 per tonne"
5056,"So we shouldn't double-count that extra cost, I will say"
5057,So I think you should think about adding earnings from the destination marketing volume that is growing and hopefully picking up something like $6 per tonne versus our original FOB trade
5058,"And then you have another source of earnings, which is a slight reduction of structural cost in the global trade desk as we improve our footprint there, as we optimize our footprint there"
5059,So those will be basically the two numbers you keep in your head
5060,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
5061,Morning
5062,"Good morning, Adam"
5063,"Adam, we've reviewed basically the underlying cost of capital model over the past several quarters"
5064,"And so, we took a hard look at long-term interest rates, equity risk premiums, betas in our model"
5065,"If you recall, when we established the 8% long-term WACC, that was done back in 2012, 2013, and looking back historically over 20 years"
5066,"And so, some of those assumptions, frankly, were outdated as we kind of look through these assumptions, we did some benchmarking"
5067,"And so, once we kind of update our model for, like long-term interest rates, recent long-term interest rates, recent equity risk premiums, we determined that it made sense to update the long-term WACC to 7% from 8%"
5068,"And a big driver of that was really equity risk premiums, which have come down over time"
5069,"In terms of what it means, our long-term objective still remains 200 basis points over long-term WACC"
5070,"So, that – the spread has not changed in terms of how we're targeting the organization for results"
5071,"In terms of your comment on Ag Services, I mean, naturally, when we set projects and when we look at projects that we're evaluating across all the businesses; there's clearly a spread above even the 200 basis points over the long-term WACC"
5072,"So, our hurdle rates remain significantly higher in the double-digit areas"
5073,"And we, frankly – we are not going to really adjust those hurdle rates because, we still believe it makes sense to really drive all the businesses to achieve strong earnings and strong returns"
5074,"But at least from our perspective, as we kind of think about longer term, what makes sense for our company over a cycle, we do believe like 7%-plus the 200 basis points spread gets you to 9% that over a cycle, we should be achieving about a 9% type of return for this company"
5075,"No, we haven't changed our assessment in terms of long-term earnings for the company"
5076,"And so from our perspective, we still believe that it is important for us to kind of drive this 200 basis point spread over our long-term cost of capital"
5077,"Good morning, Ken"
5078,"Yeah, a significant part of the increase in terms of unallocated corporate on the management line is related to our investments in IT, the business transformation and R&D and innovation"
5079,We've indicated that these are – we view those as related investments
5080,"Although again from a GAAP perspective, we classify that as expense"
5081,But it's a fairly significant investment
5082,"I mean, as you are going to appreciate, one of our priorities is to improve our business processes"
5083,"And so, we launched this program a couple years ago"
5084,"And frankly, the run rate of spending as we head into 2017 is actually a fairly significant run rate right now in terms of investments"
5085,"And so, I think, Rob, that this is actually a very, very important part in terms of our commitment, our investments, in terms of making this company better, particularly in the area of processes"
5086,"In the area of innovation, frankly, for a company our size, we were under spending in terms of R&D and innovation"
5087,And I think what we're doing right now is actually devoting the more of our spending in that area
5088,"So WILD Flavors acquisition was actually very, very important because from that acquisition, we actually acquired a lot of innovation centers around the world"
5089,And that type of expense actually goes into this line called unallocated corporate as well
5090,"When you actually take a look at what I call core central staff costs, and when I say core, I mean this is excluding IT, excluding business transformation, excluding R&D"
5091,Our core central staff costs actually are still running at what we call the 2012 levels
5092,"I mean, if you recall back in 2012, we went through a restructuring of our central staffs"
5093,"And so we've actually set our budgets and our cost plans based upon ensuring that our, what I call core central staffs, do not exceed the 2012 levels"
5094,"And, so, I think it's important to kind of understand that in what I call like true corporate central staff cost, like the functions themselves, like accounting and HR, et cetera, et cetera, we've actually kept a lid on all those costs, where as we have we actually spent more money in terms what I call investments, particularly in business transformation, R&D and innovation"
5095,That's where we've seen the increase in
5096,And we think that this is important for this company to make these types of investments at this point in time in order to allow us to be a better company in the future
5097,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thanks for the color Ray
5098,And the $50 million in run-rate cost savings that you highlight; is that net of this incremental spending in any way or is it just kind of a separate metric?
5099,That's separate
5100,"I mean, that's really related to our operational excellence initiatives there"
5101,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you
5102,"Thank you, Paulo, and hello, everyone"
5103,I'll start on slide 5 with our U.S
5104,"As expected, organic net sales performance continued to improve in Q3 to a 0.4% decline"
5105,"Volume/mix performance was in line with what we saw in Q2.To the plus side were consumption-led growth in Lunchables and P3, gains in foodservice and a roughly 30 basis point benefit from hurricane-related consumer pantry loading"
5106,"But these were more than offset by distribution losses in nuts and cheese, as well as lower shipments in meats and coffee"
5107,"By contrast, pricing began to come through stronger in Q3, reflecting higher prices in cheese and bacon to address rising commodity costs, as well as pricing in desserts that were partially offset by the timing of promotional activity versus last year in a number of categories, including Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages"
5108,"We also saw stronger EBITDA performance in Q3 than either Q2 or the first half, with adjusted EBITDA up 6.8%"
5109,"As Bernardo mentioned, incremental Integration Program savings of $125 million between the U.S"
5110,and Canada was a key contributor
5111,"Beyond Integration Program savings, lower overhead costs and favorable pricing were partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, particularly in meats and cheese"
5112,"On our last call, Paulo talked about a better balance of pricing and key commodity costs in the second half versus what we saw in the first half"
5113,"While this did, in fact, happen, it was less pronounced than anticipated, due to a step-up in dairy and bacon costs during the quarter"
5114,"Going forward, there are a couple of factors that will impact U.S"
5115,"performance in Q4. Organic sales growth in Q4 will see a 30 basis point headwind from hurricane-related consumer pantry loading in Q3; as George mentioned, delayed production line start-ups impacting cold cuts; as well as the fact that we're up against the strong 2016 fourth quarter that included some degree of retail inventory build that we don't expect to repeat this year"
5116,"That said, we do expect solid EBITDA growth to continue, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable sales, as well as further cost savings that I'll speak to later"
5117,"Let's turn to slide 6 and Canada, where in the third quarter we continued to see our focus on profitable sales pay off"
5118,"Pricing largely reflected increased promotional activity versus the prior year, as we're essentially seeing 12 months of merchandising activity being fit into the last nine months of this year"
5119,This is due to the delay in reaching go-to-market agreements with key retailers in Q1. Volume/mix mainly reflected ongoing consumption growth in condiments and sauces that was offset by lower shipments of mac and cheese versus the prior year
5120,"At EBITDA, similar to the U.S"
5121,", we had solid mid-single-digit constant-currency growth and more than 200 basis points of margin expansion"
5122,"Here, gains from cost savings and lower overhead costs, as well as improved product mix, more than offset the impact of lower pricing from higher promotional costs versus the prior year"
5123,"Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a similar picture to Q3 on the top line with solid underlying growth and a good level of in-store activity"
5124,"However, with the strong headwind in December as we expect to end 2017 with lower retail inventory levels than seen at the end of Q4 last year"
5125,"At EBITDA, grocery continue to improve from a combination of cost savings and a better balance of pricing and input costs versus the prior year"
5126,"That brings us to Europe on slide 7, where we saw a very solid quarter"
5127,"Pricing was sequentially better than Q2, but continued to be weighed down by trade investments to address competitive activity in our Italian infant nutrition business"
5128,"Volume/mix improved to 4.1% growth, driven by strong consumption gains in condiments and sauces across the region, as well as gains in foodservice, although there was a small benefit within all of this from shipment phasing versus last year as we mentioned on our last call"
5129,"Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the UK gives us the confidence that the business is on the right path"
5130,"At EBITDA, we continued to benefit from volume/mix gains and strong efforts to control costs, and this more than offset unfavorable input costs in local currency driven by transactional currency headwinds"
5131,"Going forward, in Europe, we don't expect organic sales growth in Q4 to be quite as robust as Q3 due to a combination of program timing and comparisons"
5132,"However, we do expect to see a combination of organic net sales growth and cost efficiencies continue to drive EBITDA growth"
5133,"Finally, let's look at our Rest of World segment on slide eight"
5134,"Clearly, the 3.6% organic net sales growth was not the acceleration we had expected and remains a lower rate of growth than we would expect on an ongoing basis"
5135,"We did see strong, double-digit gains in markets like Indonesia, China, and the Middle East, driven by the focused investments we've been making to drive condiments and sauces, as well as our Planters nut businesses, and this was very much in line with our expectations"
5136,"That said, for the second quarter in a row, a number of one-off factors contributed to this performance, including an unfavorable impact from distributor network realignment, which we have seen in the past couple of quarters, but should begin to fade as Q4 progresses"
5137,"We also saw lower shipments in Brazil as we've seen a general slowdown in the market, but most acutely impacting our canned vegetable business in the quarter, even though we continued to grow market share"
5138,"In addition, Q3 was further held back by overhang from the GST change in India, primarily impacting our nutritional beverages business and to a lesser extent lost sales due to the hurricane impact in the Caribbean"
5139,"At EBITDA, we saw the solid underlying growth I mentioned, together with the tight focus on costs show up at the EBITDA line"
5140,"Adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% in constant currency terms in the quarter and margin is now moving in a positive direction, consistent with the expectations we laid out on our last call"
5141,"Going forward, we do expect the impact of the one-off factors I mentioned to fade in Q4 with organic sales reaccelerating, and this should happen despite a headwind from Chinese New Year-related shipments shifting into Q1 2018 due to a later-than-normal holiday"
5142,"We also expect to better leverage the investments we've been making over the past year, driving stronger growth in EBITDA"
5143,This brings us to our outlook for the total company
5144,"I'll start by picking up on the sentiment Bernardo laid out earlier that while our numbers have not been as strong as they could have been, the impact our investments are making in the marketplace and our P&L are building the positive momentum we expect and need to continue delivering sustainable profitable growth"
5145,Our focus from here is to close out the year strong and make sure that we continue to make progress against the things that will drive positive momentum in 2018. This should play out on three fronts
5146,"First, seeding and growing organic sales"
5147,In the U.S
5148,", this means executing our strong pipeline of innovation, renovation, marketing, and go-to-market initiatives"
5149,"In Canada, to sustain the recovery in our activities at retail, as well as innovation-driven gains in our grocery portfolio; in Europe, to continue improving our share performance where we currently compete as well as capturing the whitespace in front of us including the repatriation of the Kraft brands; and for rest of world growth to accelerate with the return to run rate performance in both our EMEA and Latin America regions, each driven by a combination of innovation and whitespace gains"
5150,"Second, continuing to build profit momentum"
5151,"On cost savings, we're now targeting between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017, or $500 million to $600 million of net incremental savings in 2017 versus 2016. Ramping up supply chain related savings will be a key factor"
5152,"We're confident that the savings are there, it's more a matter of timing relative to the end of the year"
5153,Another factor at work will be business momentum picking up in the form of sequentially better organic net sales growth in the areas where we've been investing the heaviest and the levers that provides at the EBITDA line
5154,"And finally, we continue to expect a more favorable balance between pricing and input costs as we go forward with Q4 sequentially better than the third quarter"
5155,"The third and final part of our outlook is below the line costs, specifically the tax line"
5156,"Based on the flow of discrete items we've seen through Q3 and what we're forecasting for Q4, we now expect our full year 2017 effective tax rate to land at approximately 29% versus the 30% we think is representative of our run rate on an annual basis"
5157,"All things considered, we remain confident that a strong earnings profile should continue to show through, driven by a combination of profitable organic sales and EBITDA growth"
5158,"Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions"
5159,Question-and-Answer Session
5160,This is David
5161,And thank you for the question
5162,"So to summarize my comments from earlier, I'd say in Q4 we'd expect organic sales to reflect two things"
5163,"One, some one-off headwinds from the U.S"
5164,"and Canada, but we do expect this to be offset by acceleration in rest of the world"
5165,So I think that's kind of the trajectory you would expect for organic sales
5166,The other thing I would say is we continue to expect strong EBITDA growth globally into Q4.
5167,"Hi, Matt"
5168,"This is David, and thank you for the question here"
5169,"So to answer your question, I think there are a few things to note on how the P&L is playing versus last year"
5170,"So on gross margin, as you asked, the performance versus last year really reflects two factors"
5171,"So first, we've seen an unfavorable balance in pricing and commodities, with commodity inflation that we've talked about in first half and last quarter"
5172,"I'll reiterate that we did see improvement in Q3, and we expect to see an accelerated improvement in this balance into Q4. And in fact with that improvement in Q4, it should enable better flow through of savings – of our integration savings to the bottom line to EBITDA"
5173,The second factor here to highlight is we did have some increased depreciation and amortization expense within our gross margin line
5174,"If you actually take this out – and it's related to the footprint projects that we've talked about previously – if you take out this increase, our gross margin actually increased in Q3 by 35 basis points"
5175,"So again, we started to see the improvement in Q3 which we expect to improve with PNOC and into Q4."
5176,"Hi, Rob, this is David"
5177,And thanks for the question
5178,"So to answer it, I think this increase in integration savings that we saw from the $1.7 billion to a range from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion"
5179,"Again, this is net of some of the inflation and investments we talked about, so that's an all-in number"
5180,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
5181,"So it would've been higher, but are you raising your freight number in there also? Would it have been higher"
5182,"Again, this is an all-in number, so it's net of some of the inflation investments that we've had"
5183,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
5184,Good afternoon
5185,"Thanks, Bernardo"
5186,"And hi, Bryan, thank you for the question"
5187,"So on the SG&A line, I'd say we did see a significant decline versus prior year as a percentage of sales, and that really reflects lower people cost that we've seen, as well as ZBB savings versus prior year"
5188,"The one thing I want to note to address your question is as you update your models, you should not straight-line the SG&A as a percentage of sales like you saw on year-to-date in Q4 – or sorry, year-to-date in Q3 into Q4, because we do have some seasonality in this line item"
5189,"So I'd say if you think about EBITDA for the year – sorry, for Q3 globally, we saw strong EBITDA growth up $120 million to $130 million"
5190,That was really driven by two things
5191,"One, cost savings in North America, as well as growth in Europe and rest of the world"
5192,"So if you look at North America, we're actually up $100 million, and the difference there, the $30 million, is really driven by Europe and rest of world"
5193,"So in North America, we have the benefit of $125 million of integration savings"
5194,"The delta there, the $100 million growth in EBITDA, was really driven by the unfavorable balance of pricing commodities that we talked about, which did improve in Q3, but was still had one for us, and that was partially offset by savings in the business"
5195,So that's kind of the rough trajectory of EBITDA versus prior year
5196,"Hi, David"
5197,Thank you for the question
5198,"So I think to answer your question, like I said, we had an increase in depreciation related to the footprint which if you strip this out we would've had increasing gross margin of 35 basis points"
5199,So I think the disconnect there is really timing related relative to the ramp up that we would see in some of these programs relative to the CapEx that we have to spend
5200,"Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us this morning"
5201,We will start off this morning with highlights for the third quarter and a discussion of each of the operating sectors' performances in a little more detail; and then Hugh will cover the full year outlook
5202,"For the quarter, we delivered revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth in what continues to be a volatile macro environment"
5203,Organic revenue was up 1.7% for the quarter and 2.3% year-to-date with solid net price realization operating margin expansion in most of the sectors
5204,"Although we have moderated our full year organic revenue growth outlook, we now expect full year core EPS of $5.23, which is 2 percentage points or $0.10 higher than our previous expectation"
5205,"This improvement is being driven by the strength of our year-to-date results, coupled with an improved outlook on foreign exchange impact"
5206,"Each of our operating sector’s performance came in on or ahead of expectations with the numbers showing sequential topline acceleration, with the exception of our North American Beverages business, where net revenue and operating profit declined"
5207,"So, let me start with that"
5208,"While North American Beverage performance was below our expectations, I will tell you upfront that the issues are temporary and we believe we have taken the necessary actions to improve the performance of this business beginning in Q4. So, what happened? From an industry perspective, weather was comparatively negative, both temperature and precipitation, following record hot summers in 2015 and 2016, and there was a marked slowdown in the C-store channel in Q3. Now given this as a background, our performance did lag the industry, no question about it"
5209,"First, Gatorade, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of our Q3 volume declined following two sequential years of terrific Q3 growth"
5210,"In fact, Q3 volumes were up a total of 18% over 2015 and 2016. Relative to other beverage categories, this is one that is both much more sensitive to weather and more exposed to the C-store channel"
5211,So the broader weather and C-store industry themes I just mentioned had an outsized impact on Gatorade
5212,"Second, we underperformed the industry in carbonated beverages"
5213,"This summer, we directed too much of our media spending and shelf space to new low-calorie, much smaller brands at the expense of our Pepsi and Mountain Dew trademarks"
5214,While our plans for the summer were consistent with our continued and deliberate strategy to transform our beverage portfolio
5215,"Clearly, we redirected some big brand space to these new products as opposed to focusing on new incremental space"
5216,"We view both of these conditions as temporary and not structural, and we fully expect topline performance to improve in the coming quarters"
5217,"We have a good handle on what happened, and we are making immediate adjustments to get the business back to growth"
5218,"We are stepping up marketing spending on Pepsi and Mountain Dew, including our zero and low calorie products under these trademarks"
5219,We are reallocating and securing incremental shelf space in this place for our existing and new products to drive better overall velocity
5220,"We are tweaking our consumer communication with sharper brand messaging on pack, at point of sale, and through traditional social and digital media"
5221,"We have more innovation directed at our biggest trademarks, including low and no calorie products that will hit the market starting in early 2018, and we're executing our programs responsibly to ensure that we're driving profitable growth"
5222,"With the expected improved topline, we also expect improved profit performance as we realize both mix and scale benefits from the improved sales trajectory"
5223,"To be clear, our beverage transformation initiatives over the longer term have been very successful in shifting our mix to faster growing subcategories and providing more low and zero sugar options"
5224,"Since 2010, we have increased our mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points"
5225,"Over the decades, we have established and maintained leadership positions in many of the most attractive noncarbonated categories, and we have successfully introduced many offerings to appeal to consumers' increasing demand for zero and low calorie offers"
5226,"So, make no mistake about it, we remain squarely on strategy and having made a few course corrections, expect NAB to return to growth in the coming quarters"
5227,"Moving on to Frito-Lay North America, we had another quarter of very strong results, with a good balance of volume growth, net price realization, and operating margin expansion"
5228,"We feel very good about the business with innovation, pricing, execution, and market share performance all on target"
5229,"We are particularly pleased with the continuing strength in organic sales growth, which is being fueled by effective price pack management and innovation backed by great marketing"
5230,Take Cheetos as an example
5231,"We drove 6% net revenue growth for the trademark in Q3 with new products, such as Cheetos Paws, Jalapeño Cheetos, and our SIMPLY line, and Mac n' Cheetos also contributing to the growth"
5232,"The innovation is well-supported by creative consumer engagement that included our award-winning Cheetos virtual museum campaign that asks, ""What do you see in your Cheetos?"" The program garnered 100,000 online consumer submissions and countless earned media impressions"
5233,"Ruffles, which grew net revenue 11% in the quarter benefited from innovations such as Spicy Jalapeño Ranch and Flamin' Hot that appeal to consumers' increasing desire for both flavors"
5234,"And beyond our largest trademarks, we saw impressive double-digit net revenue growth in premium and better-for-you offerings such as SunChips, Smartfood Popcorn, and Miss Vickie's and in our variety multipacks that provided great assortment of our top brands in convenient single-serve packages"
5235,"At Quaker Foods North America, we are pleased with the sequential acceleration in organic volume, organic revenue, and core operating profit performance, and we continue to feel positive about the trends in the business"
5236,"Our activations of portable breakfast innovation, namely Breakfast Flats launched in 2016 and Breakfast Squares that were launched in the first quarter are yielding positive results"
5237,"And our second quarter launch of Overnight Oats Cups, capitalizing on the growing trend of preparing chilled oats using a variety of healthy ingredients is also gaining traction with consumers"
5238,"Taken together, our innovation and other programming drove mid-single-digit volume growth in our base oatmeal portfolio"
5239,"To wrap-up North America, I'm pleased to report that year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated more retail food and beverage revenue growth in the United States measured channels than all other 5 billion plus manufacturers combined"
5240,"And in the third quarter, Frito-Lay on a standalone basis was once again the number one contributor to total U.S"
5241,food and beverage retail growth among all 5 billion plus manufacturers
5242,Turning now to our sectors outside North America
5243,"In Latin America, we continue to see very challenging macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability, which dampened consumer spending"
5244,"As we enter our fourth quarter, the devastating impact of the Mexico earthquakes and hurricanes in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico are clearly adding to these challenges"
5245,"Within this context, our businesses in the region performed well in the third quarter, posting 5% organic revenue growth"
5246,"Mexico, our largest market in the region, had high single-digit organic revenue growth, while Brazil grew organic revenue mid-single-digits"
5247,"Similarly, we have continued to experience macro challenges in a number of markets throughout our Asia, Middle East, and North Africa segment, including the significant currency devaluation in Egypt and the economic impacts in a number of markets across the Middle East stemming from persistently low oil prices"
5248,"However, we have been adjusting our business to address these challenges"
5249,We are pricing to cover the increased cost of doing business and we are going more aggressively after productivity to reduce our overall costs
5250,"As a result, we saw a noticeable improvement this quarter as AMENA delivered 9% organic revenue growth driven by double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Pakistan, Philippines, Egypt"
5251,"And turning to Europe and Sub-Sahara Africa, we had very good results across the region, with organic revenue growth in each of our top four markets, along with six of the next seven key markets and a sequential acceleration overall, which translates to margin expansion and 12% core constant currency operating profit growth"
5252,"Organic revenue growth was well balanced across snacks and beverages, which grew high single-digit and mid-single-digit respectively, driven by strong product innovation and in-market executions"
5253,"Russia, our largest market in the region, had mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and very strong operating margin improvement"
5254,"Among our other key markets, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in Turkey, mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in France, Poland and Germany, and low single-digit organic revenue growth in the U.K"
5255,"Now as we mentioned last quarter, across our businesses, we're pleased with the progress we're making in the e-commerce channels, and I say channels, plural, because we're addressing growth opportunities across eGrocery, pureplay, urban grocery delivery, direct-to-business and direct-to-consumer models"
5256,Our success is underpinned by the significant investments we've made in attracting talents to and building capabilities in our dedicated global e-commerce business unit
5257,"So today, we have a team of roughly 200 e-commerce professionals supporting our businesses to capture growth in the rapidly emerging e-commerce channels"
5258,"It's made up of seasoned e-commerce and tech professionals, combined with our best entrepreneurial talent from within PepsiCo and we're managing this unit more like a tech company than a traditional CPG from how and where they work, the risks they can take, to how they are compensated"
5259,And we continue to fortify and enhance the full suite of capabilities that we believe will enable us to win in these channels from data analytics to specialized e-commerce supply chain knowhow
5260,"Importantly, we're increasingly collaborating with our retail customers to make our e-commerce capabilities yet another point of differentiation in our value-added relationships with them"
5261,"For example, using big data and predictive analytics to shape real-time marketing messages, dynamic merchandising, and tailored offers, our team is enabling us to drive greater purchase instrumentality and higher basket size for our customers online"
5262,"As a result of these efforts, we have a business that's approximately $1 billion in annualized retail sales with impressive growth in key e-commerce markets"
5263,"For example, this year, our e-commerce retail sales are projected to be up 80% in the United States and nearly double in China"
5264,"In many cases, our online share exceeds our offline share and we are gaining online pretty much across the Board"
5265,"While overall penetration of food and beverage remains relatively low compared to most of the categories, it is growing fast and its development is sure to be highly dynamic, and we believe we are well-positioned to win in this space"
5266,"Despite the many macro challenges, we continue to feel good about the state of our business"
5267,The fundamentals we have been focusing on and discussing with you remains solidly intact
5268,We have a leading product portfolio and deep capabilities
5269,"We continue to drive growth, product innovation, exceptional marketing, and innovation"
5270,"We continue to transform our portfolio to capitalize on evolving consumer trends and we have a robust productivity agenda that is enabling us to continue to invest in the business, while delivering attractive earnings growth"
5271,And finally this quarter demonstrated that the PepsiCo portfolio does have the capacity to generate topline and bottom-line growth even in the occasional quarter where we see a downturn in a particular sector
5272,And it is the resilience of the portfolio that is also enabling us to increase our earnings outlook for the year
5273,"With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh"
5274,"Look, we have gone deep on the business to understand what is environmental factors that contributed to our performance and what is our own execution aspects that contributed to performance, and I’d tell you that, roughly speaking, my assessment is about 70 -30 in terms of what the weather, the precipitation, what the C-store slowdown caused to the business, and what we could have done differently"
5275,"And as I said in the script, Judy, Gatorade is a big part of our business and we were lapping 18% over 2015 and 2016, and with a slowdown of C-stores -- C-store traffic and the weather patterns in Q3, clearly Gatorade was impacted because the weather has an outsized impact on Gatorade"
5276,That was the first one
5277,The second is CSDs
5278,"We've been embarking on a deliberate strategy to shift the portfolio to lower calorie offerings and they tend to be more non-carbonated beverages, and that's why we shifted about seven points of the portfolio to non-carbs"
5279,"We have a lot more lower calorie and zero calorie innovation in CSDs, and we actually have it even under the big brands, the Pepsi and the Mountain Dew brands"
5280,"So, what we're going to be doing going forward is taking the big brands and doing a lot more low calorie and zero calorie offerings under that brand"
5281,"So, I tell you if I looked at this quarter, the only two that we need to focus on is getting Gatorade back to growth, which we're already beginning to see and tweaking our advertising spending against Pepsi and Dew"
5282,The thing to be very careful about is we are focused on responsible growth
5283,"During the quarter, as we saw the trends, we could have very quickly hit a promotional lever and tried to drive growth, and we tried our best not to do that because we think that once you go down this promotional spiral, it's never-ending"
5284,"So, our team is focused on profitable growth, responsible growth, and we are all focused on getting CSD trademarks and Gatorade back to growth"
5285,Good morning Laurent
5286,Let me give my comments and then Hugh step in with yours
5287,I actually believe ownership of the bulk of the bottling system is an advantage because you can actually do two things
5288,"One, you can flex them quickly and second is that you can extract more productivity from a bigger base"
5289,"So, I actually believe it's a good thing"
5290,"During a period when a refranchising is going on, what happens is that you have funds that you can use to deploy against the market"
5291,But that is a temporary situation and that is going to get exhausted very soon
5292,"So, we have to be careful that while the marketplace might have extra funding during a refranchising activity, we don't overreact by hitting a promotion lever to get short-term value -- volume in the business"
5293,"Having said that, what are the structural issues we see? One, we see a continued decline in full-sugar beverages"
5294,We see consumers shifting to lower calorie and zero calorie beverages
5295,"And we do see a lot of little competitors coming into the marketplace with interesting new beverage offerings, some of which stick, many of them don't stick"
5296,"So, what we have to do is create an entity within our company that does smaller brands, but smaller brands that stick and grow into medium size and bigger brands, we have to create that capability, which we are doing; and second is that the big lesson from Q3 is that it is an and game, not an or game"
5297,"When we launch new products, we have to go for new shelf space"
5298,"The core shelf space, especially in C-stores for the big brand, we have to protect the hell out of it and that's what we're going to do"
5299,"And Hugh, do you want to add anything to it?"
5300,"But you know, Hugh, it's also safe to say that, as a leadership, we are focused singularly on value creation, shareholder value creation and we spot trends and if we think we have to make changes in our business, we do that"
5301,"So, at this point, we think our strategy is the right strategy"
5302,"And in terms of overall cost management, we put in place a Smart Spending program about one year ago"
5303,"And as the months go by, we just get better at being smarter and smarter with Smart Spending"
5304,"And what you're seeing, because right here in corporate, we drive Smart Spending very, very seriously and that's where you're seeing the reduction in corporate cost"
5305,Good morning Vivien
5306,Dara good morning
5307,"I'll answer the second answer, and then, Hugh, you should take the first one and talk about what's changed"
5308,"I think that the thing to be careful about is not just the reinvestment, it's how much and in what"
5309,It's better to invest in pull activities than to hit the pedal on push activities
5310,"Because when you start getting into this competitive battle of more and more promotions, we've been there, done that, I don't think that's a way to create long-term, strong businesses"
5311,"So, we've tended to focus more on innovation and pull-related spending, more A&M spending"
5312,The shift to digital is a question mark because I don't know what the ROI on digital is as yet
5313,And we're relooking at all elements of our marketing spending to see exactly which method of spending gives us the best ROI by brand
5314,"So, that's a piece of work we are doing"
5315,"What we want to do over the next few quarters is look at our brand portfolio and see how best to do trademark advertising, so we can focus on the big brands and still drive lower calorie products"
5316,The thing to be careful about is this industry should not escalate to going from push spending to pull spending and everybody throws a lot of money into this business
5317,"It's going to be a judicious management of this business, where you've got the right amount of A&M spending and judicious execution, so this business remains profitable going forward"
5318,I think that's where ownership of the bottling business is going to make a huge difference because we can work all of these levers very carefully
5319,"So, the next few quarters, watch and see what we do to tweak our spending and what the benefits are"
5320,We feel reasonably confident
5321,Good morning Bryan
5322,"So, Bryan, we're not a talking about any long-term algorithm or guidance at this point"
5323,We usually do that in the February meeting
5324,"But let me tell you in broad shapes, our focus is on innovation, our focus is on portfolio expansion, our focus is on shift to Better For You, Good For You products"
5325,And our focus is on productivity and stepped up levels of productivity
5326,The whole goal is to marry our innovation capability with our productivity programs
5327,"And we've had remarkable success over many, many, many quarters"
5328,"This one quarter was a bit of a [Indiscernible] on North American Beverages, and I call it [Indiscernible] because there were many external factors that caused this"
5329,"And believe me, we are all over this business and we will be back"
5330,There is no issue
5331,"So from a long-term algorithm, just wait until February next year when we do give you the guidance"
5332,"But all I say to you, our focus is on balanced top and bottom-line growth"
5333,Invest in the topline; make sure the right productivity to deliver the bottom-line growth
5334,Make sure that you invest in all the new capabilities needed and generate the productivity to invest in new capabilities
5335,"That is a tried and tested playbook, and we're not backing off of that"
5336,Lauren good morning
5337,"You want to take the first part, Hugh?"
5338,And talking about NAB trends
5339,"When you're looking at weather and you're looking at precipitation, you don't plan for a cooler weather or higher levels of precipitation"
5340,"So, we fully expected that this summer would be a normal summer, not a flaming hot summer, but we thought it'd be normal summer"
5341,"And so we kept investing behind the brands like Gatorade, but then when the weather completely turned south and -- not literally, but it was cooler and a lot more precipitation, that advertising spending did not give us much lift as we would've liked the business to get"
5342,"Now, if we have not been lapping the 18% growth, it's a whole different ballgame"
5343,"The problem is the combination of lapping the 18% growth for the last two years in Gatorade, plus the fact that we had a cooler summer this year, when it's our seasonally big quarter is what caused the issue"
5344,And one of the things we've told our businesses is that don't do anything in the short-term which will have no lasting impact for the long-term
5345,"Many years ago, we use to just hit the promotional spending lever"
5346,And I think what we're doing very carefully now is saying don't hit the promotional spending lever because that won't last for the long-term
5347,"So, the weather was a big factor"
5348,"And we hate to use weather as an excuse, Lauren, but the weather was a big factor"
5349,"And we didn't make all the changes anticipating poor weather, we just kept playing our playbook and that's what caused the issue"
5350,"Again, it's temporary, we're taking the actions and we are all over it"
5351,Good morning Ali
5352,"Well, I'm going to talk about the pricing question and then Hugh is going to give you a good answer on the rest of it"
5353,"As I said, Ali, at least two or three times, and thank you for asking the question, we are focused on responsible growth"
5354,The goal is not to hit the promotional lever and try to just buy short-term volume
5355,"And that's the message that's been made very clear to our entire North American beverage Business, and Al and Kirk and the team are singularly focused on that"
5356,"So, you will see PepsiCo executing a very responsible strategy going forward, balancing push and pull spending so that it's profitable growth"
5357,"In terms of productivity and the plans for cost reduction, Hugh, why don't you just provide the answer for that?"
5358,Good morning Robert
5359,"Hugh, do you want to take that? So, let me give you some of the -- what we're seeing in some of the geographies"
5360,We're actually seeing a strong lift in European business
5361,"All of our business -- actually West and East Europe, we're seeing tremendous strength"
5362,All our businesses are doing well
5363,We have a wonderful portfolio in the ESSA market
5364,"And we have the right marketing programs, the right pricing programs in place and that's why you're seeing such a stepped up growth rate in the ESSA market, both East Europe and Western Europe"
5365,"And our Russia business in particular is doing very well, and so we feel very, very good about that"
5366,"In the Middle East, which is another big market for us, clearly this year we saw the impact of the lower oil price, the tax on CSDs, all of that went into place"
5367,"Again, we have taken all the appropriate actions to implement more productivity, start to shift the product portfolio"
5368,"And while we took a short-term shock to the system, we're coming out of that"
5369,"And we think that the Middle East, North Africa still represents a very, very good market with lots of consumers is still in coming into the peak consumption years"
5370,"So, we feel good about that market"
5371,The prospects for recovery in those markets are good
5372,"As I look at China and the Asia-Pacific region, our business in China is doing well, especially our Snacks business is doing very well"
5373,Our Quaker business is doing exceedingly well in China
5374,The team is a good team
5375,Our e-commerce business is on fire in China and doubling in size every year
5376,"And it's becoming a learning lab for us to learn how to do e-commerce for the rest of the world, so we feel good about China"
5377,The wonderful thing about the rest of Pacific Rim is that you've got many markets; all these little tigers are recording pretty good GDP growth
5378,"The markets may not be big as a China or India, but each of these markets contributes positively to our performance, and we've been doing well on those markets and gaining share in all of those markets"
5379,We have good bottling partners
5380,Our own operating businesses are very good
5381,Good leadership teams
5382,Those businesses are doing well
5383,"We don't see much of a concern in those markets, even though they've gone through some political ups and downs"
5384,"In the South Asian subcontinent -- India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, we face the normal upheavals from GST, the demonetization -- or remonetization, I should say"
5385,We are through all that now
5386,And hopefully the business will start to steadily recover in India
5387,But Pakistan has been a big success story for us
5388,We have a good business there and it's growing very nicely and profitably
5389,Latin America is a big question
5390,We have strong businesses in Mexico and Brazil in Central America
5391,"Clearly, Latin America has gone through its share of geopolitical issues, and recently, the earthquakes have really had a devastating impact in Mexico; and the hurricanes that swept through the Caribbean and Puerto Rico have a really decimated those islands"
5392,"In spite of that, the teams have performed well"
5393,And our Brazil business is doing very well and our Mexico business is doing well across both Snacks and Beverages
5394,"So, in those markets, I would say we're holding in Latin America, doing exceedingly well in the ESSA region"
5395,"Our AMENA sector is, in spite of all the issues, coming back very nicely"
5396,"North America is our core, and we remain positive about the North American business"
5397,"Now and then, there will be a quarter where some business has a hiccup or a toast up"
5398,The resilience of our overall portfolio is what allows us to deliver the numbers we're delivering
5399,"So, overall, we still feel quite confident about our prospects and we are buckling our seatbelts and saying, ""There will be geopolitical instability, there will be weather-related issues, we just have to build a portfolio that can weather that and somehow profit through and deliver the performance"
5400,Good morning Pablo
5401,"Pablo, great question"
5402,"First of all, we always get pushback from retailers and everything"
5403,"I think the real thing is that from PepsiCo's perspective and DSD company, we have big brands and our brands have high velocity"
5404,So the combination of those three yields tremendous profitability for retailers
5405,"And clearly, some upside brands have come in and taken a lot of shelf space"
5406,"Our challenge is not to just say, ""Hey, give us more space for core CSDs,"" it's how do we provide the right innovation to go after those upstarts who are taking a lot of space"
5407,"I tell you one of the issues I would say, and I take full responsibility for this, maybe in a couple of cases we were slow to respond to some of these newcomers who have taken a lot of space"
5408,"And believe me, we will fix that"
5409,"And going forward, the agility and speed of response from our company will go up significantly"
5410,"Sometimes when you have too many big brands and too much success under your belt, you lose a little bit on speed, and we are working to fix that"
5411,"So, I think you'll find that the retailers actually welcome the DSD suppliers to keep their shelves looking good going forward and that's what we provide with our beverage portfolio"
5412,"In terms of the third leg, we've tried to build it organically with success, Wimm-Bill-Dann was the last big acquisition we made, and except for the Russian ruble that went through its own share of challenges after we bought Wimm-Bill-Dann, coming out of that, the business has performed exceedingly well"
5413,It's an ideal portfolio
5414,"I think what we have to be very, very careful about -- if we went off and built that third leg through acquisitions, we have to think hard whether they're shareholder value creating, what kind of a premium do you pay for any acquisition and how do we realize the benefits of that deal enough to offset the acquisition premium"
5415,"And believe me, the stuff we've looked at so far, we don't see a clear path to that"
5416,"And so as we've said many, many times to all of you, we want to make sure that any major acquisition we may -- minor or major, I'm sorry; any acquisition we make has a clear path to value creation"
5417,"And if we don't see that, we typically do not make the acquisition"
5418,We try to do things organically
5419,"It may take longer, but they create much more value over the long-term"
5420,"Hugh, did you want to add anything on that?"
5421,Mark good morning
5422,Don't know
5423,"Don't know, Mark"
5424,"You know what I think with our revenue growth rate, they're still up there in the top performance in the Whole Food and Beverage space"
5425,"And so it's an environment that requires us to modify our model, our innovation model, our retail, our outreach model"
5426,"And you know what, when you go through these sorts of transformations and you're tweaking part of the business model, there will be issues along the way"
5427,"If we focus on the year and looked at our performance versus other people in the space, I think we stack up pretty well, both on the top and the bottom-line"
5428,"And so will we lean harder on productivity, we will always lean harder on productivity, because we believe that we ought to take out any cost that is not value creating and put it back into investments in the business or flow it through to the bottom-line"
5429,And that has been our modus operandi
5430,"So, productivity will always be paramount in PepsiCo"
5431,"As we get better at it, we will keep doing more of it"
5432,But we're not taking our focus off of growing the topline
5433,"To us, growing the topline is really the right way to grow the company in a very, very balanced way"
5434,"So, we are redoubling our efforts to grow the topline"
5435,We're looking to see how to spend the A&M that we put out in a much more efficient way
5436,"To me, that's the Holy Grail"
5437,"We all spend a lot of money on A&M, how do you spend it in an efficient way so we get the appropriate lift from the A&M? But you know it's interesting times in the entire CPG world globally"
5438,"And we have the size, scale, capabilities, the brands to be a very, very important player in this business and a top performer and that's what we're focused on maniacally"
5439,"And Mark let me just close by saying; personally, I'm completely committed to this company because 50 time my salary is in PepsiCo stock"
5440,"And with that level of ownership, believe me, this is something Hugh and I focus on 24 hours a day"
5441,Good morning Caroline
5442,"Caroline, good morning"
5443,"Yes, good morning Caroline"
5444,"Yes, look even in Europe, our categories have had private label penetration, but not to the extent that many other HPC or other categories have had"
5445,"Having said that, we are not complacent about any of this"
5446,"Basically, I think, as we look forward, we're still looking at retailers, if they want to deliver margin growth in a period in which they're seeing price compression, they have a couple choices"
5447,They can do private label or they can get more efficient or they can get innovation to the stores from the big manufacturers that drive more traffic and velocity
5448,"So, I think what could happen -- Caroline, this is just my perspective, is that you could see a bifurcation"
5449,"You could see big brands, big companies taking the burden off of retailers through DSD and by bringing our own label into the store and driving more velocity and traffic through the big brands and innovation"
5450,"And then you could see on the other end, a combination of small brands and private label that flanks it on the other side"
5451,What could be squeezed in the middle is sort of the mid-size brands
5452,"Now, this is just my perspective, and we've been looking at all of this really hard"
5453,We think that could be a possible scenario going forward
5454,"So, from our perspective, doubling down on big brands, making sure innovation is -- making sure execution is perfect; our whole system is aligned, so when we have to make changes, we can do it fast"
5455,"And then within our company, making sure we have enough levers on productivity so we can get more and more efficient deploying automation and other tools to be able to put it back on innovation, driving the topline growth, whatever we have to do"
5456,I think that's going to be the game going forward
5457,"As we said in the last call, this is going to be a period of brilliant disruption over the next three to five years and we're going to approach it with pessimism or optimism"
5458,We actually think this could be a time when a lot of competitor balances could be reset
5459,And as perhaps the largest U.S
5460,"company in food and beverages and the second largest food and beverage company in the world, believe me, we will play an outsized role in this resetting of the competitive balance"
5461,Good morning
5462,Go ahead Hugh
5463,"So, thank you all for your questions"
5464,And let me just summarize by saying we are pleased with our year-to-date results for the third quarter with strong results across most of our sectors and we expect our topline performance to accelerate in Q4 as performance at NAB recovers
5465,And we're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of at least 9% core constant currency EPS growth
5466,And we believe we are well positioned to continue to perform well over the long run
5467,"As always, thank you for joining us this morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment"
5468,"Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody"
5469,"Following are our consolidated financial headlines for the second quarter versus pro forma results a year ago, except for cash flow, which is reported on an actual basis"
5470,"Global net sales per hectoliter grew 1.7% in constant currency, driven by the U.S"
5471,", Canada and Europe"
5472,"Worldwide total brand volume increased 2.3%, due to strong growth in Europe and International, partially as a result of adding the Miller global brands business, but also from growth in some of our core brands"
5473,Our global priority brands grew 4.6%
5474,"GAAP net income increased 4%, and underlying non-GAAP net income increased 2.9%, driven by increased brand volume, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, cost savings and lower marketing spending, partially offset by a higher underlying effective tax rate"
5475,"This non-GAAP result was up nearly 50% on a reported basis, which demonstrates the substantial earnings accretion from the MillerCoors transaction"
5476,"In the second quarter, we reported nearly $794 million of underlying EBITDA, a 4.2% increase from the pro forma result a year ago"
5477,"In constant currency, underlying EBITDA was up 5.7%"
5478,"Year-to-date underlying free cash flow was $586.7 million, which more than tripled versus $176.9 million in the first half of 2016. This significant increase was driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows, as well as lower cash paid for taxes, which were partially offset by higher cash paid for interest"
5479,"With this strong free cash flow, we reduced our net debt by more than $522 million in the second quarter"
5480,"Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights for the second quarter"
5481,", we grew net sales and underlying EBITDA on a pro forma basis, with 7.9% earnings growth driven by lower MG&A expenses, higher net pricing, positive sales mix, and cost savings"
5482,"domestic net sales per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 1% for the quarter as a result of higher net pricing and positive sales mix, partially offset by cycling a multi-year adjustment in federal excise tax expense last year"
5483,Cycling this adjustment in federal excise tax reduced our NSR per hectoliter by 40 basis points this quarter
5484,"Overall, U.S"
5485,"STRs declined 1.9%, but against the backdrop of a weak industry, we achieved our best first-half market share trend in more than three years"
5486,"STRs were particularly soft late in the second quarter, which drove moderately higher than planned inventories for our distributors at the end of the quarter, but also lower out of stocks around the 4th of July holiday"
5487,We expect the majority of this additional inventory to be sold through by the end of the third quarter
5488,"We grew our share of the Premium Light segment, with Coors Light achieving its ninth consecutive quarter of increased segment share and Miller Lite reaching 11 consecutive quarters of increased segment share"
5489,"Overall, our Premium Light segment volumes were down low-single digits"
5490,Coors Banquet grew volume at a mid-single-digit rate and also increased segment share
5491,"Our total Above Premium segment returned to growth, up low-single digits, driven by both our regional and national craft brands"
5492,"Blue Moon Belgian White, Leinenkugel's, and Peroni grew strongly, while Redd's and Henry's posted lower volume"
5493,"Zima, which returned to the U.S"
5494,"market for a limited period, was Nielsen's number five growth brand for the four weeks ending July, the 1st"
5495,"Our below-premium brands were down low-single digits for the second consecutive quarter, a significant trend improvement from the last – the past several years"
5496,"Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 9.7% on a reported basis, primarily due to the impact of lower volume, input cost inflation, and negative foreign currency movements"
5497,Underlying EBITDA in constant currency was 7.2% lower
5498,"Overall Canada brand volume declined 1.3%, as a result of lower domestic volumes, partially driven by soft industry volume"
5499,"Including the return of the Miller brands to our portfolio, we increased overall market share for the second consecutive quarter"
5500,Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter
5501,"Nonetheless, we continued to drive our First Choice agenda, including revenue management strategies, to bring momentum back to the top line"
5502,"As a result, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 2.3%, driven by positive pricing and brand mix, primarily due to higher import brand volume"
5503,We continued to premiumize our portfolio through volume and market share gains by import brands led by Coors Banquet; above-premium craft brands including Belgian Moon and Granville Island; and the addition of the Miller brands
5504,"Europe grew underlying EBITDA 13.8%, which equates to 21.3% growth in constant currency, driven by higher volume, positive sales mix, the quarterly timing of marketing investments, increased net pension benefits, and the later timing of the Easter holiday this year"
5505,These positive factors were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements
5506,"Brand volume increased 11.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the transfer of royalty and export brand volume across Europe from our International business and the addition of the Miller brands, along with the timing of Easter and strong growth from our core and above-premium brands"
5507,Net sales per hectoliter increased 3.7% in local currency due to positive mix and net pricing
5508,"Underlying EBITDA for our International business was a loss of $0.9 million, which improved from a loss of $1.7 million a year ago"
5509,Brand volume increased more than 40% in the second quarter to 1.2 million hectoliters
5510,"Our second quarter net sales grew more than 65% due to higher volume, along with positive pricing, while net sales per hectoliter declined 5.5% due to sales mix changes"
5511,"This increase was driven by the transfer of our Puerto Rico business from MillerCoors, the addition of the Miller global brands, and Coors Light growth in Latin America, partially offset by the transfer of Europe royalty and export business to the Europe segment"
5512,"In Latin America, excluding the addition of Puerto Rico, we grew Coors Light volume at a high-single-digit rate"
5513,"The Miller brands integration process is continuing to progress as expected, and we have successfully exited almost all of our Transitional Service Agreements during the second quarter"
5514,"In each of these instances, we have established routes to market that give us a strong platform for growth"
5515,"Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the second quarter, as well as our latest outlook and guidance targets"
5516,"This quarter, we have made the following adjustments to our guidance metrics: We now expect cost of goods sold per hectoliter for the full year 2017 in our International business to decrease at a mid-single-digit rate, versus a double-digit decrease previously"
5517,With the dynamic tax environment in the U.S
5518,"right now, we are not changing our tax rate range of 24% to 28%, but our current view is that our full year underlying tax rate will be in the top half of this range"
5519,"We now expect cash pension contributions in the range of $300 million to $320 million to defined benefit plans in 2017. This range is $200 million higher than our previous target, as we plan to make an additional discretionary contribution of $200 million to our U.S"
5520,plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goal
5521,"Rating agencies treat pension under-funded status the same as debt, so this pension contribution will also benefit our investment-grade debt ratings"
5522,"Note that all of these anticipated pension contributions are included in our 2017 underlying free cash flow target of $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%"
5523,This discretionary contribution is a strong indication of the progress we are making in achieving our financial plans and quickly paying down debt
5524,"We remain committed to reducing our leverage ratio to about four times on a rating-agency basis by the end of 2018. Looking forward, we are focused on three primary financial targets – first, cash generation; we made great progress in this area in the second quarter, and we are confident that we will achieve our cash goals this year"
5525,"Second, deleverage; we reduced our net debt by more than $520 million in the second quarter"
5526,"And third, we continue to expect the underlying EBITDA margin growth to average between 30 basis points and 60 basis points for the next three years to four years, while we remain focused on growing our top line, as well"
5527,"At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for the business outlook, wrap up and the Q&A"
5528,"Hi, Judy"
5529,"So, just a couple of things"
5530,"As I've said before, my priority is to generate free cash flow as quickly as possible, so that we can deleverage, and we've made that commitment to the rating agencies to be around four times by the end of 2018. So, U.S"
5531,", I mean, we are generating stronger free cash flow and that has allowed us to make this incremental contribution to our U.S"
5532,"So, that is the U.S"
5533,So I do want to remind you that pension contributions are deductible for tax
5534,That $200 million in gross
5535,You would need to tax effect that to get the net number
5536,"And then, the other part that goes in to our free cash flow is obviously our working capital and the timing of working capital does play into the guidance that we've given of the $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10%"
5537,"And in terms of looking forward to 2018, we're not ready to give guidance here for 2018. We will do that early in 2018 to help with that"
5538,"So, Judy, look, we – our cost savings and synergy plans are on track"
5539,"And so, we are pleased that we are delivering the cost savings"
5540,"We have, as you rightly mentioned, we've said that for 2017, it is going to be more than the $175 million"
5541,"However, we are not breaking that up quarter-by-quarter because that number does fluctuate and this is for the full year, it will be more than $175 million and we are very pleased with our plan so far to deliver the $550 million over the three years"
5542,"So, hi, Steve"
5543,"So, the additional contributions that we made is to the U.S"
5544,plan
5545,"So, it is pulling forward next year's contributions"
5546,We had an opportunity to do that
5547,"However, the U.S"
5548,isn't the only pension plan
5549,"So, I don't want to say that there won't be any further contributions to pension plans, but this one is a pull forward for the U.S"
5550,plans
5551,"Having said that, there's a number of things that enter our decisions as to the amount to contribute to our pension plans, and one of those is market performance against our assets"
5552,"So, depending on how the assets perform, will also tell us how much we need to contribute"
5553,"And then just going forward, we're not going to give any contribution guidance at this stage, but we will do that again early next year, depending again as how our assets and our plan performs"
5554,"So, a couple of things maybe just to keep in mind"
5555,"So, Gavin did mentioned the fourth quarter of last year for the U.S"
5556,"Just to give a number around that, we're cycling in Q4 for MillerCoors, and a pre-tax income increase of 42%"
5557,"So, that's a big headwind for us in Q4. The other thing just to mention is we – in Q3 we're cycling one more quarter of the Canada brand amortization"
5558,If you recall in Q4 of last year we reclassified some of our brands to definite lives
5559,"So, we've got one more quarter of that cycle in Q3. And then the other thing just to mention from a Canada point of view is the COGS per hectoliter last year in Q4 was actually a reduction, so recycling very positive performance in Q4 of last year"
5560,And then another headwind just to consider is we do have the higher corporate cost as you mentioned
5561,"We are investing, for example, behind our global business services that we opened in May in Romania, and we're investing behind the shared service center that we'll be keeping in Milwaukee"
5562,"So, there is a couple of costs to consider for this year that we will be investing and also cycling some performance"
5563,"And then, again, just to remind you, the 30 basis points to 60 basis points, we do look at that over a longer term, so three years to four years"
5564,"So, yes"
5565,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone"
5566,Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter
5567,"Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.57, up from the $0.41 in the prior-year quarter"
5568,"Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $658 million, up $85 million from the year-ago quarter"
5569,The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 28% compared to the 29% in the second quarter of the prior year
5570,"Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.8% is 100 basis points higher than the same period last year and 80 basis points above our 2017 annual WACC of 6.0%, thus generating positive EVA of $195 million on an annualized basis"
5571,Our ROIC has continued to improve for the fourth consecutive quarter
5572,On chart 19 of the appendix you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share
5573,"For this quarter, we had a $0.04 per share net charge related to an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business partially offset by the gain on the sale of the crop risk services business"
5574,"We also had $0.04 per share charge for impairments, restructurings and settlements, and a $0.01 charge related to LIFO"
5575,Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line
5576,"Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the corporate items affecting our quarterly results"
5577,"Net interest expense was up approximately $18 million to $81 million primarily due to higher short-term interest rates, our overall mix of short-term and long-term debt following the issuance of our new fixed-rate debt in August of last year, a favorable interest rate expense adjustment last year, and some additional interest expense related to foreign income taxes due from prior years"
5578,"Looking ahead, we're continuing to project net interest expense of approximately $320 million for the full year 2017, consistent with what we indicated at the beginning of the year"
5579,"Unallocated corporate costs of $134 million were up versus the prior year and modestly below our $140 million per quarter guidance for fiscal year 2017. The increase is primarily due to the planned increased investments in innovation, IT, and business transformation"
5580,Minority interest and other charges increased to $35 million primarily due to updated portfolio investment valuations in CIP
5581,"Turning to our cash flow statements for the first six months on slide 6, we generated $1 billion from operations before working capital changes similar to the prior year"
5582,We had favorable changes in working capital of a bit over $300 million
5583,Total capital spending was $452 million
5584,Our current expectation for fiscal year 2017 is capital spending of approximately $1 billion
5585,"Acquisitions of $180 million were primarily related to Crosswind Industries, a pet treat manufacturer; and Chamtor, a French producer of wheat-based sweeteners and starches"
5586,"We spent about $511 million to repurchase shares and including dividends, we returned $875 million of capital to shareholders by midyear"
5587,"Our average share count for the quarter is 574 million diluted shares outstanding, down 20 million shares from this time one year ago"
5588,"At the end of the quarter, we had 571 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis"
5589,"Slide 7 shows the highlights of our corporate balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 and 2016. Our balance sheet remains solid"
5590,Our working capital of $7 billion was down $1.2 billion from the year-ago period
5591,"Total debt was $7 billion, resulting in a net debt balance of $6.3 billion"
5592,Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%
5593,"Our shareholders' equity of $17.4 billion was down slightly from the $17.7 billion last year, due primarily to returns of capital shareholders in excess of net earnings"
5594,We had $5.1 billion in available global credit capacity at end of June
5595,"If we add available cash, we had access to $5.8 billion of short-term liquidity"
5596,"Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance"
5597,"Morning, Heather"
5598,"Morning, Adam"
5599,"In terms of, Ken, I mean, naturally you mentioned there are things that we can control and there's things that we can't control"
5600,"For the things that we can control, as Juan indicated, some of the actions that we're taking in terms of delayering spans of control"
5601,"In addition, yesterday we announced that we're going to effectively sunset our U.S"
5602,salary DB plan
5603,"So, when you take a look at things that we can control, when I look at 2018, again, we haven't started our 2018 planning process yet"
5604,"But when you take a look at our run-rate type of savings, right, for 2018, for the things that we can control of the list that – of what Juan announced, there's probably at least about $100 million of run-rate savings that we will be able to benefit in 2018. And that's going to continue into the future there"
5605,"So, again, we do believe – again, we haven't started our 2018 planning process yet"
5606,"But, again, for things that we're working on right now, at least of what we have announced, at least $100 million of run-rate savings"
5607,"And don't forget, in terms of the savings that we're going to generate this year, as Juan indicated, we are well on track to pass our cost reduction targets for this year"
5608,"I mean, that will also be ongoing savings into the future"
5609,"So, again, I think we – that's the reason why we feel good about the future"
5610,We feel good about our path towards getting back past our historical earnings and towards our long-term 10% ROIC target with the actions that we're taking
5611,"I mean I think, Farha, I mean when I take a look at our second quarter results, I mean, clearly our Tianjin operation is improving, so that helps in terms of improving the S&S line"
5612,"Our European operations are improving, year-over-year improvements there"
5613,"So, that's a positive in terms of numbers"
5614,Our cost reduction efforts in corn also translate to year-over-year improvement
5615,"So, there's a lot of actions that we've taken which have driven the improvements in sweeteners and starches"
5616,You mentioned some of the other improvements
5617,"Remember, lysine is actually part of the Bioproducts division"
5618,And so the – some of the Bioproducts' improvements are actually related -relate to lysine around that particular alliance
5619,"So, all in all, Farha, again, I don't have the exact numbers but I can assure you that a lot of the improvements in sweeteners and starches are actions that we have taken either to grow the portfolio or actually make our cost even more competitive in our processing plants"
5620,"Thank you, Ken"
5621,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call"
5622,Today I'll share my perspective on our performance in the quarter and provide my view on our progress across each of our three divisions
5623,Anthony will follow with a detailed financial review
5624,Let's be real
5625,I am not satisfied with our overall sales performance in the quarter
5626,"Organic sales declined 2%, with the most prominent declines in Campbell Fresh and V8 shelf-stable beverages"
5627,"Additionally, in the Campbell Fresh segment, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to the carrot and carrot ingredient and Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting units"
5628,Anthony will walk you through additional details during his comments
5629,"There were some bright spots in the quarter, such as growth in U.S"
5630,"soup, simple meals, Pepperidge Farm snacks, and fresh soup"
5631,"Our adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points, all of which was achieved by Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
5632,Another positive result was the over-delivery of our cost-savings initiatives
5633,"As we announced this morning, we now expect to achieve our cost-savings target a year ahead of schedule"
5634,"Based on the success of the program to-date and the identification of additional savings opportunities, we're raising our cost-savings target from $300 million by the end of fiscal 2018 to $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020. Looking at the first half, organic sales declined 1%, adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago, and adjusted earnings per share increased 5%"
5635,"With the expectation of improved sales performance in the second half of the year, we reaffirmed our full-year guidance this morning"
5636,Now let me offer my perspective on the performance of each of our three divisions in the quarter
5637,Let's start with the Campbell Fresh division
5638,"The CPG segment of C-Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus, dips and chips and fresh soups"
5639,The Farms portion of the portfolio includes carrots and carrot ingredients
5640,The division's performance was below our expectations this quarter
5641,"C-Fresh is an important strategic business for Campbell, and we remain confident in the growth potential of the packaged fresh category, as consumer preferences continue to shift towards fresher and healthier foods"
5642,"In fact, nearly 80% of consumers, including younger ones, are trying to eat more fresh foods"
5643,"These consumers not only believe that fresh foods are cleaner, healthier and less processed, but that they also taste better"
5644,We acquired two packaged fresh businesses: Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet with brands that resonate with consumers as a way to develop a long-term growth platform in packaged fresh CPG
5645,The perimeter categories in which we compete are still growing significantly faster than the traditional center-store
5646,"While category growth rates have slowed somewhat, we still believe we can build a profitable growth business, leveraging these brands, capabilities, and our scale"
5647,"However, our performance over the last year in fresh has been disappointing"
5648,"The reasons vary by business, which I'll explain in more detail in a minute"
5649,We've made a number of changes to address this
5650,"Most notably, we replaced the leadership team and appointed a long-time Campbell executive Ed Carolan as the President of C-Fresh in November"
5651,"I'm confident in this new seasoned leadership team, which includes Campbell executives, some newcomers to the company, and key members of the Bolthouse Farms team who possess CPG and agriculture experience as well as insight into both the operations and the entrepreneurial culture of the organization"
5652,It's taking longer than we originally expected to regain carrot customers following last year's quality and customer service issues and to rebuild capacity following the Protein PLUS beverage recall
5653,"As a result, we no longer expect C-Fresh to grow this fiscal year"
5654,"Over the last quarter, our new team has conducted an extensive strategic review to assess the potential of this business going forward"
5655,This has helped us update our expectations about future growth based on the fresh categories in which we compete and is leading to a sharpened strategy
5656,"As a result of this work and our current-year performance, we've lowered our expectations for both long-term sales and earnings"
5657,We've learned some tough lessons over the last several quarters and we're applying them
5658,"As a first step, we started to integrate the supply chain to reengineer the fresh operating model"
5659,"We're building a stronger foundation under the Campbell Fresh business, leveraging Campbell's scale and expertise, realizing synergies, and building capacity and capabilities in order to return it to profitable growth"
5660,Let me now take each piece of the business individually and explain
5661,Let's start with farms and specifically the carrot business
5662,"After experiencing quality issues last year due to execution and poor weather conditions in California, we've restored our carrot quality"
5663,We've demonstrated this improved quality to customers and are working hard to earn back the lost business over time
5664,Our previous assumptions were too aggressive and regaining share is turning out to be more difficult than planned
5665,"In the current quarter, our carrot business faced additional challenges, again related to the weather"
5666,"In California, rainfall in December and January was significantly higher than normal"
5667,This hampered our ability to harvest fields and lowered our yields on the carrots we did harvest
5668,This negatively impacted both sales and earnings in the quarter
5669,Now let's turn to beverages
5670,"Last June, we voluntarily recalled our Protein PLUS beverages for quality reasons"
5671,"At that time, we had a 47% market share of the protein segment and Protein PLUS was one of our strongest performing SKUs"
5672,The good news is that consumers are seeking out protein products and our Protein PLUS consumer is a loyal shopper
5673,"As previously discussed, we implemented enhanced processes to improve the quality standards, resulting in fabulous product quality, albeit at reduced run times"
5674,"Since then, we've steadily improved but have not returned to pre-recall production levels"
5675,We've added an additional beverage line in our Bakersfield plant that we expect to be fully operational in April
5676,"As we discussed last quarter, we're seeking additional ways to increase capacity"
5677,"We've had challenges in finding co-packers that meet our quality standards, but we've recently qualified a co-packer and expect to be significantly expanding our capacity by the summer"
5678,We're able to fulfill shelf-stock and service levels back to the high 90s
5679,"In addition, we're seeing increases in velocity each period as we regain distribution"
5680,"While we're selling everything we make, we have insufficient capacity to fulfill merchandising demand across the full range of our beverages"
5681,Our plan is to re-launch Protein PLUS merchandising in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 when we expect to have sufficient supply
5682,"Due to our continued capacity constraints, we don't expect our beverage business to return to growth until the fourth quarter"
5683,"Meanwhile, we remain focused on driving innovation across the Bolthouse Farms CPG range, including dressings, spreads, and super-premium and ultra-premium beverages"
5684,We recently extended our salad dressing line with a range of four new organic varieties
5685,"We also launched a test of Bolthouse Farms MAIO, a new line of refrigerated yogurt-based spreads made with clean ingredients and fewer calories than mayonnaise"
5686,"Later this year, we plan to expand our line of 1915 by Bolthouse Farms organic, cold-pressed juice and launched Bolthouse Farms Plant Protein Milk, a higher protein alternative to almond milk"
5687,Customer response to this new product has been very positive
5688,"Now, turning to Garden Fresh Gourmet"
5689,"As a reminder, the business has four product groups: salsa, which is over half of the business; hummus, dips and chips; and fresh soup"
5690,The business offers a combination of branded and private-label products
5691,"The traits that made Garden Fresh Gourmet an attractive acquisition target, a small authentic brand with a compelling story have also presented some obstacles"
5692,"When we acquired it in June 2015, Garden Fresh Gourmet was a small operation with approximately $100 million in revenue and very little infrastructure"
5693,The integration into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform proved to be challenging
5694,"The truth is, we expected more, faster in multiple areas of this business, including financial systems, information technology, and supply chain integration, as well as increased marketplace distribution"
5695,Let me explain the issues we've encountered and what we're doing to fix them
5696,"Garden Fresh Gourmet branded salsa is growing strongly in consumption, and we've regained a major customer beginning January 2017. Private-label salsa is below expectations due to lost distribution with two customers"
5697,We've recently regained one of these customers and active negotiations are underway with the second
5698,"Throughout its short history, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa was largely a Midwestern brand"
5699,Our plan called for the rapid distribution expansion of branded salsa beyond the Midwest
5700,"However, it became apparent that we did not have the differentiated recipes and taste profiles that would be accepted by consumers in other parts of the country"
5701,We now have the recipes to pursue expanded distribution
5702,"In January, we launched branded Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa in new packaging with new regional recipes"
5703,We're focused on key distribution and velocity-building initiatives
5704,"For example, in January, we gained national distribution for new branded organic salsa with a major customer"
5705,"Today, our ACV distribution of Garden Fresh branded salsa is only 37%, so we have a lot of runway to match the 70% ACV levels of our other C-Fresh CPG brands"
5706,"We're optimistic that we can get there with delicious high-quality ingredients, product and packaging innovation, improved marketing and sales support, and expansion into organic and regional flavors"
5707,I do want to take a moment to highlight a positive result in the division
5708,"We've made significant gains in our fresh soup business, which continues to grow at high single-digits, driven by both private label and branded soup"
5709,"We recently introduced a new Garden Fresh Gourmet soup, which has been well received by customers and initial velocity is encouraging"
5710,"We're also testing Souplicity, a new artisanal cold-pressed soup"
5711,"We continue to expect to grow the Garden Fresh Gourmet business profitably, but it will take longer than we originally planned"
5712,"Overall, we've learned several important lessons from these two packaged fresh acquisitions and we're applying them going forward"
5713,"First, establishing a leadership team with diverse skills and experience early on is critical"
5714,Our new team combines the talents and capabilities of Campbell and Bolthouse leaders
5715,They're actively integrating C-Fresh into Campbell and taking advantage of our full suite of resources
5716,We're now blending the best of small while also benefiting from the best of big
5717,"Second, fresh food is more perishable and, therefore, more fragile"
5718,"At Campbell, we're obsessed with safety and quality"
5719,"We put safety above all else because if we don't, nothing else matters"
5720,Meeting Campbell's quality standards in C-Fresh required significant investment and the right resources
5721,"Third, there's no roof over the carrot fields"
5722,We've experienced everything from severe drought to record rainfall
5723,This business has been much more volatile than expected
5724,"We've set up more diversified growing regions, but we have more to do to strengthen our agricultural operations"
5725,"Fourth, the fresh supply chain presents an opportunity for productivity improvement and optimization"
5726,We believe we can and will drive margin improvement in these businesses over time
5727,"Finally, we have both the ability and the desire to build strong brands and drive growth in response to increasing consumer demand for fresh foods"
5728,"To recap, we're facing some challenges in C-Fresh beyond what we originally realized"
5729,Our new leadership team is making progress in addressing them
5730,"To be clear, we remain committed to the packaged fresh category and to M&A in the fresh space as we build this growth platform"
5731,Now let's turn to Global Biscuits and Snacks
5732,"As a reminder, this division includes our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and Kelsen businesses"
5733,The organic sales decline in the division was mainly a result of the performance of Kelsen and our decision to forego some less-profitable business for the large U.S
5734,"Additionally, the depreciation of the Chinese RMB negatively impacted our sales in China"
5735,"Stepping back and looking at the underlying trends in Kelsen, China, we feel good about our execution during the important Chinese New Year period"
5736,"As we've discussed previously, we've been working to expand our distribution capabilities in China, and we've been adding new sub-distributors to extend our reach"
5737,Our sell-in for Chinese New Year went according to plan and promotion displays were consistently strong across all store formats
5738,We're still awaiting consumer takeaway
5739,Turning to the U.S
5740,", Pepperidge Farm delivered modest sales growth behind the continued strong performance of Goldfish crackers as well as cookies, especially the Milano brand"
5741,"Goldfish growth benefited from channel gains, leveraging multiple pack sizes and innovative new products"
5742,Goldfish made with organic wheat is also attracting new millennial families to the brand
5743,"However, our fresh bakery sales declined as a result of intensified competitive activity, especially in the sandwich bread category"
5744,"As a reminder, we're cycling double-digit operating earnings growth this quarter, and we expect a strong back half as this division delivers both sales and margin growth"
5745,"Looking ahead, we're focused on driving continued growth in Goldfish and increasing innovation in cookies, especially the upcoming launch of our new farmhouse line in April"
5746,These cookies leverage Pepperidge Farm's baking heritage and deliver against our Real Food Philosophy with great taste and simple ingredients
5747,We'll also continue to build the national rollout of Tim Tam biscuits in the U.S
5748,following its recent launch in January
5749,"Rounding out the portfolio is our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
5750,I'm encouraged by the sales gains in soup and simple meals
5751,"However, this was offset by the lackluster performance of V8 shelf-stable beverages"
5752,"I continue to be pleased with the Americas gross margin expansion, driven by the performance of our supply chain team"
5753,"Once again, the division delivered strong operating earnings growth of plus 8%"
5754,Our U.S
5755,soup business grew in the quarter
5756,I'm especially pleased with our ready-to-serve brands
5757,Sales increased double-digits in ready-to-serve
5758,Chunky continued to lead the way behind our improved execution and strong integrated marketing that fully leveraged our NFL sponsorship
5759,"We're also delighted with the launch of our new Well Yes! clean label soup, which hit shelves in December"
5760,"Retailer acceptance has been exceptional, with ACV already around 75% and most customers taking all nine varieties"
5761,We activated our marketing plans in January and the initial consumer response has been positive
5762,"It's early days, but we feel good about our overall execution and how we got out of the starting blocks with this brand"
5763,"Sales declines in our broth business were as a result of increased competitive activity, mainly from private label offerings"
5764,"As discussed last quarter, we had strong holiday merchandising plans for our broth business, and we were pleased with the execution of that program"
5765,"However, we did not achieve the consumer takeaway that we expected as a result of an extremely competitive holiday period"
5766,"In the short term, we will be sharpening our promotional activity and marketing message to drive improved performance in the back half of the year while we continue to develop longer-term plans to improve our competitiveness and differentiation in this important category"
5767,Looking ahead on U.S
5768,"soup, we have robust marketing plans in the third quarter and we continue to expect to deliver modest growth in soup this fiscal year"
5769,The shelf-stable beverage category remained sluggish and our portfolio continues to be challenged
5770,"As I previously stated, V8 will not grow this year"
5771,Let me reframe the conversation to provide a little more context
5772,"In the quarter, consumption grew in two-thirds of our business: V8 100% Vegetable Juice, Veggie Blends and our V8 + ENERGY franchise"
5773,All of them are on trend and leverage our heritage in vegetable nutrition
5774,"Importantly, we continue to see improved consumption trends in V8 100% Vegetable Juice, following our increased marketing support"
5775,"The remaining one-third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is declining, partly due to category-wide consumer concerns about sugar"
5776,"Despite the overall sales declines, the business continues to focus on productivity initiatives, which are contributing to the overall gross margin expansion in the division"
5777,"Big picture, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division continues to be on track to deliver modest sales growth and margin expansion"
5778,"In closing, I want to stress again that I am not satisfied with our overall sales results this quarter"
5779,"I own it, and we have plans in place to improve our performance in the second half, deliver our cost savings, invest back in our business, and deliver our full-year guidance"
5780,"It's really important to keep sight of the long-term progress we've made in transforming this company in a difficult operating environment: our continued gross margin expansion, how we strengthened our core business while expanding into faster-growing spaces, the investments we're making in real food as a result of our purpose, how we've diversified our portfolio with innovation and acquisitions, and a leaner more agile and more cost-effective company we've become as a result of our successful cost-savings initiative, I look forward to seeing many of you next week at CAGNY where we will focus on Campbell's long-term strategic growth platforms"
5781,"Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro"
5782,Yeah
5783,I'll take that one
5784,"Thanks, Ken"
5785,We're very pleased with the performance of Pepperidge Farm
5786,"We've had, particularly in the snacks business, some really good growth"
5787,"And our distribution system – DSD distribution system is different, in that it is a network of independent contractors, so that's really how we've assessed it"
5788,"I mean, we're continuing to run our play"
5789,"We're very happy with the introduction of Well Yes! There were great retail support, 75% ACV distribution, displays everywhere, but we won't get a read on the consumer takeaway really until this quarter"
5790,"Hi, Bryan"
5791,"Hey, Andrew"
5792,"Andrew, it is a key question"
5793,"And when I talk about getting the best of small and the best of big, I'm really serious about what we have done is really delineated those parts of the business that really need to be separate and differentiated for the consumer and the customer, and that's all of the marketing and the R&D and insights"
5794,And we have this model that we've used very successfully with our Plum organic baby food business by keeping those parts of the business separate that maintains that entrepreneurial culture
5795,"However, being able to leverage the scale of Campbell's, particularly in areas of the supply chain and in operations where we have resources that can be used to make them much more effective and efficient and even more important achieve scale, because these are typically smaller companies that need the chassis to increase scale in the marketplace"
5796,So we've done this very successfully with Plum and Kelsen
5797,We have not done it with the Campbell Fresh business
5798,"And so, the situation that we found ourselves in in the last year, we've been able to insert Campbell executives on the leadership team working in conjunction with Bolthouse Farms executives to maintain that best of small and best of big"
5799,So we're really optimistic and we're finding some really great opportunities to put a stronger foundation under the business
5800,See you next week
5801,"Hi, Rob"
5802,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hi
5803,Yeah
5804,I think the activity definitely varies by category
5805,And what we've seen in the fresh bakery business is competition in the area of sandwich bread and Swirl bread
5806,We've recently reformulated our Swirl bread and we're out there now with a much-improved product
5807,So that was a very specific situation
5808,"In fresh bakery business, our buns and rolls business continues to rock, so we believe we're all over the issue there"
5809,"And then in broth, it was really more of a proliferation of private label during the holiday and that produced more price competition and we have responded with increased marketing and actual trade spending to hold our own in that category"
5810,So those were two very specific things that we faced
5811,"Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Can I ask a follow-up to Ken Goldman's question actually? I think what he was kind of getting at is have you ever considered a model where you go to direct-to-customer shipments through warehouses rather than DSD, not so much using – whether you use independent routes"
5812,Is that a big savings or is it even possible in Pepperidge Farm?
5813,Yeah
5814,We've been pleased with the DSD system
5815,"The independent contractors, what they bring to the business in terms of selling and merchandising and delivery, it's a quality product"
5816,"It's perishable, so breakage could be an issue"
5817,"I think when you consider all of it, we're pleased with our DSD system"
5818,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
5819,Thank you
5820,We're very focused on our soup business
5821,"We're particularly pleased with the performance of ready-to-serve soup, whether that be Chunky or the introduction of new Well Yes! I think you need to ask the other guy"
5822,Hi Alexia
5823,"The strategic review that the new team undertook looked at, once again, the potential for this business, and we verified the consumer trends toward fresh and health and well-being, the fact that these categories are still growing significantly faster than center-store categories, particularly in the categories that we compete in"
5824,So we feel really good about this space strategically
5825,We've had some execution issues this year and some weather issues in the agricultural part
5826,"That's been unfortunate, but that does not sway us from our long-term strategic vision to really build a fresh food platform for Campbell's"
5827,And I think the role of the carrots in the business is the authenticity
5828,It's on trend with consumers' desire for fresh produce
5829,"Carrots have had a tough go with drought and with heavy rains and some execution issues in the last year, but I do think that that's an important part"
5830,It's also the distribution system and scale in produce for us that makes us more important to the retailer
5831,So I know I'm very committed to the business and we expect big things from it going forward
5832,"I think, over time, we have an opportunity to build two very strong brands here with Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet"
5833,"We're continuing to invest in digital marketing, as you point out, some new packaging and definitely new product innovation"
5834,So we will continue to support these businesses in the marketplace
5835,"Hi, Rob"
5836,"Well, as you can see from the quarter, we're continuing to invest in marketing and brand building"
5837,"And Anthony pointed out that as we navigate through our cost-savings initiative, which we just increased, we will be spending back on our businesses to continue to build these brands"
5838,We still need to drive sustainable profitable sales growth and I fundamentally believe that's going to come from investing in the brands and engaging with the consumer
5839,So we will continue on that track
5840,Thank you
5841,"Thanks, Juan"
5842,Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter
5843,"Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75, up from the $0.65 last year"
5844,"Excluding specified items, adjusted operating profit was $827 million, up $194 million from the year-ago quarter"
5845,The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32% compared to negative 2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year
5846,"Our tax rate was significantly higher this fourth quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings as well as approximately $18 million of discrete tax expenses in 2016 compared to approximately $100 million of discrete tax benefit in 2015, which were a result of portfolio management actions taken in the year-ago quarter"
5847,This fourth quarter also includes $18 million of additional tax expense related to truing up the first three quarters of the year to the final year-end 2016 effective rate
5848,This true-up had a negative impact on both reported and adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of $0.03 per share
5849,Our trailing four-quarter average ROIC of 5.9% is down by 150 basis points from the 7.4% at the end of the fourth quarter last year
5850,"The adjusted ROIC is below our 6.6% annual WACC for 2016. Our ROIC has started to improve following the challenging operating conditions that we experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. On chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.73 to the adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share"
5851,"For this quarter, we had a $0.03 per share charge related to asset impairments, restructurings and settlements, a $0.04 per share OPEB curtailment gain in corporate and certain discrete tax expenses not related to the current year earnings of $0.03 per share, including valuation allowances on net operating losses and tax credits"
5852,Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line
5853,"Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results"
5854,"In all four businesses, we had some small charges related to impairments and restructurings"
5855,"In the corporate line, net interest expense was up modestly due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and the issuance of a new fixed-rate debt in August of this year"
5856,"Unallocated corporate costs of $132 million were up versus the prior year and slightly higher than the run-rate for previous quarters, primarily due to an approximately $20 million investment in a corporate initiative that created an equivalent offset or reduction to our income tax expense for the quarter"
5857,"Minority interest and other includes a $38 million OPEB curtailment gain, related to changes to the U.S"
5858,retiree medical program
5859,"Turning to the cash flow statement on slide 6, we generated $2.1 billion from operations before working capital changes during the period, slightly lower than the prior year"
5860,"Total capital spending for the year was $882 million, down from the prior year's $1.1 billion and consistent with our guidance last quarter that CapEx for the year would be below $1 billion"
5861,"Acquisitions of $130 million in 2016 include Harvest Innovations, our Moroccan corn processing facility, the Medsofts joint venture and Caterina Foods"
5862,"The other investing activities line of cash flow statement includes the incremental investments we made in the Wilmar, less proceeds from divestitures and asset sales, such as our Brazilian sugar ethanol operation"
5863,The proceeds from our sale of the GrainCorp shares are reflected in the marketable securities line
5864,"During the year, we spent about $1 billion to repurchase shares, consistent with our prior guidance"
5865,"Our average share count for the year was 591 million diluted shares outstanding, down 30 million from this time one year ago"
5866,"At the end of the year, we had 581 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis"
5867,"Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends was $1.7 billion for the year"
5868,"Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Our balance sheet remains strong"
5869,Our operating working capital of $7.4 billion was up slightly from the year-ago period
5870,Total debt was about $6.9 billion resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $6 billion
5871,Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 26%
5872,"Our shareholder's equity of $17.2 billion was down slightly from the $17.9 billion level last year, due to returns of capital and changes in the cumulative translation account"
5873,We had $5.8 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December
5874,"If you add available cash, we had access to $6.7 billion of short-term liquidity"
5875,"Before I turn it over to Juan, I'd like to comment on some of the key corporate assumptions for 2017. We expect net interest expense to average about $80 million per quarter, due to slightly higher interest rates"
5876,"Unallocated corporate costs should average about $140 million per quarter, as we invest more in R&D, innovation and business transformation"
5877,"We expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 29%, consistent with our normalized rates in recent years"
5878,"Share repurchases should be in a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements, which means our average share count for 2017 should be somewhere between the 565 million and 570 million shares"
5879,And we're planning capital spending to be in a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion
5880,"Next, Juan will take us through a review of business performance"
5881,"Good morning, David"
5882,"Yes, Heather, it's Ray here"
5883,"Yes, indeed we are still talking with different parties regarding these ethanol assets"
5884,"We are also looking at some different structures, frankly as we think about tax reform coming in the United States, it does actually open up some different considerations as well in terms of how to structure the transaction because we've been looking effectively at some tax restructures"
5885,"And if there is tax reform and if the corporate tax rate does come down, it does open up the avenue for us to look at some other mechanisms in order to look towards monetizing these assets"
5886,"And when we talk about approaching $1 billion, we see improvements in sweeteners and starches both in North America as well as international"
5887,"We see improvements in the lysine business based on the operational improvements that we have, and we also do see improvements, on price some small improvements in terms of the ethanol, as we talked about earlier"
5888,"So when you add it all together, that's the reason why we're fairly constructive about our outlook for the Corn segment in 2017."
5889,"I think if you recall, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range is both subject to strategic capital allocation"
5890,"So in that respect, to the extent that we find that there are opportunities for us to redeploy capital for our shareholders that makes more sense in terms of a strategic transaction, then we will"
5891,"We'll reduce the amount that we buy back, and we'll redeploy that amount towards acquisitions"
5892,Remember our capital allocation framework was roughly 30% of the cash flows would go towards CapEx and about 70% will go towards strategic M&A and/or buybacks
5893,"So therefore, we are going to follow that framework"
5894,"With respect to Wilmar, you've seen us increase steadily our stake in Wilmar"
5895,We've been opportunistic about that
5896,We've increased our stake and taking advantage of pullbacks in terms of share price
5897,We haven't paid consistent with book value
5898,"So we've been very careful in terms of how we increase our stake in Wilmar, which we believe is a very important strategic partner and frankly a very important part of our Asia and emerging marketplace"
5899,"So at the current level, which is about 23.9%, we feel fairly comfortable"
5900,Will we increase further in 2016 (sic) [2017]? It will be a function of whether we believe there's an opportunity for us to pick up the shares at an attractive price
5901,"So again, we'll just monitor the market, take a look at our cash flows, take a look at how we're deploying capital, and then make decisions as we move through the course of the year"
5902,"You also have to remember that when you talk about strong dollar, you have to talk about what the currency pair is because a lot of people kind of focus on the dollar versus the euro, but when you actually look at versus the Brazilian reais"
5903,"or the Argentine peso, a year ago at this call, the reais was trading at BRL 4 to the dollar"
5904,Right now it's trading at BRL 3.1. So the reais has actually strengthened
5905,"When you take a look at versus the Russian ruble or Ukrainian hryvnia, again crop growing regions, those currencies actually strengthened versus the dollar"
5906,So we just have to be careful when we talk about the strength of the dollar
5907,"Yes, generally, there's a trend towards a strengthening dollar"
5908,"But relative to a lot, the crop-growing regions of the world, over the past 12 months we've actually seen those currencies strengthen relative to the dollar"
5909,So I just want to make sure that there's a balanced perspective when we talk about the currency here
5910,"I think the biodiesel tax credit, I think we've indicated over the years, it's been roughly around $50 million, plus or minus"
5911,And so therefore that's a number that it's in our plan and we believe there is a good chance for the biodiesel tax credit getting renewed
5912,"But don't forget, I mean, it's very possible that the biodiesel tax credit may get wrapped up in the whole aspect of corporate tax reform as well"
5913,"And from our perspective, we believe that any type of corporate tax reform would be positive for ADM, because as you know, in the agricultural sector, being a U.S"
5914,"domicile company, we pay the highest tax rates in the industry"
5915,"So bringing our statutory tax rates from 35% level to either at the 15% level that Mr. Trump has talked about or the 20% level that Republican Blue Print is talking about is very, very positive"
5916,"And then, they've also talked about the border adjustment tax, which for exporters, agricultural exporters like ADM, that would be a positive too for us"
5917,"So there is a lot of dynamics when you think about implications of tax reforms, the biodiesel tax credit"
5918,"We're all monitoring this very, very carefully, but in general, we feel very positive about the direction that the administration is heading towards looking at improvements to our corporate taxes"
5919,"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining Clorox's Second Quarter Conference Call"
5920,"On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, Clorox's Chairman and CEO; and Steve Robb, our Chief Financial Officer"
5921,"We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany"
5922,"Let me remind you that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit"
5923,Management believes that providing insights on these measures enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations
5924,"Reconciliation with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available in the financial results area of our website, as well as in our filings with the SEC"
5925,"In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release"
5926,Please recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements
5927,Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans
5928,Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans
5929,The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
5930,"So with that said, we'll turn to our prepared remarks"
5931,I'll cover highlights of our second quarter business performance by segment
5932,"Steve Robb will then address our financial results and outlook, and finally Benno will close with his perspective and then we'll open up the call for questions"
5933,So let me start with volume and sales
5934,"As our second quarter sales reflect, the continued investments we've been making behind innovation and marketing are driving strong volume and sales growth"
5935,"Starting with volume, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of 8% growth, our highest gain in nearly 10 years, and with increases, importantly, in each of our four segments"
5936,"Turning to sales, sales were up 5%, our highest growth in four years with increases in all of our U.S"
5937,segments
5938,This sales growth reflects very strong volume on our base business in the U.S
5939,in addition to price increases in certain international markets as well as about 2 points of growth from our acquisition last year of the Renew Life digestive health business
5940,These factors were partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates
5941,"Excluding slightly less than 2 points of negative foreign currency, total company sales were up 6% versus the year-ago quarter"
5942,"So simply put, we feel great about our top line results for the quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year"
5943,Our businesses are healthy and performing very well
5944,"Now turning to market share, our 13 week share in U.S"
5945,tracked channels increased 1/10th of a point versus the year-ago quarter with gains in four of our eight U.S
5946,retail business units
5947,"This reflects our demand-building investments supporting recent innovation as well as our efforts to increase competitive activity in a number of categories, including Glad and Home Care"
5948,"From a category standpoint, tracked channel data reflected a decline of about 2/10th of a point"
5949,"However, our sales results in the quarter clearly indicate that tracked channel data does not capture the strong performance we're seeing in a number of untracked channels or businesses such as Home Care growth in the club channel, continued growth in our Professional Products business, strong results in the home hardware and pet specialty channels, growth with some untracked retailers that strongly support our Burt's Bees and Renew Life businesses and then finally, the momentum in online sales across our entire portfolio"
5950,"Notably, there are some categories where e-commerce or online sales represent a top 10 or a top 5 channel with many of our businesses seeing very strong double-digit sales growth"
5951,So those are our results on a total company basis
5952,Let me now turn to our segment results
5953,"Starting with our Cleaning segment, second quarter volume increased 10% and sales grew 3% behind higher shipments of Home Care products and Professional Products, partially offset by lower shipments of Laundry products"
5954,Volume outpaced sales growth as we secured incremental distribution in the club channel and invested more heavily in trade promotion
5955,"In Home Care, which is our largest U.S"
5956,"business, sales increased high single digits"
5957,"This gain was driven by disinfecting products, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes and sprays, and all-time record shipments of Clorox toilet bowl cleaners as we continued to invest behind the total Clorox brand equity"
5958,"Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of market share gains"
5959,"Looking to build on these results, we began shipping in December Clorox Scentiva, our new line of disinfecting sprays and wipes that also provides experiential fragrances"
5960,"Initially we're offering two fragrances, Tuscan Lavender & Jasmine and Hawaiian Sunshine"
5961,"While it's still very early, we are pleased with the initial results of these new products"
5962,"Moving on from Home Care, the Professional Products business delivered solid sales growth in the quarter"
5963,"As in our Retail business, Clorox branded products are performing very well in the Professional Cleaning portion of the business"
5964,"We're particularly excited about Clorox Fuzion, a new cleaner and disinfectant available to health care institutions which was launched in September"
5965,"What makes Fuzion unique is that it kills microorganisms with minimal residue or odor, addressing a significant need in health care"
5966,"Although Clorox Fuzion was just recently launched, it is running well ahead of expectations"
5967,"Turning to our Laundry business, sales decreased due to continuing softness in the sodium hypochlorite category"
5968,"However, our focus remains on shifting consumption to higher-margin products such as Clorox Splash-Less Bleach, as well as investing behind our Clorox 2 color safe bleach"
5969,"Turning to our Household segment, we delivered 11% volume growth and 12% sales growth"
5970,"These results reflect the benefit of the Renew Life digestive health business we acquired last May as well as higher sales in all of the other businesses in the segment: bags and wraps, charcoal and cat litter"
5971,"So starting with bags and wraps, which is our Glad product line, we delivered sales growth driven by all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher-margin segment"
5972,"And while market share in tracked channels for the bags and wraps category was down, due to a decrease in base trash bags, we continue to see growth in untracked channels with increases greater than 30% of Glad trash bags at some online retailers"
5973,"Turning to charcoal, top line results were up double-digits"
5974,"That said, we also recognized Q2 as a relatively small quarter for this business"
5975,So charcoal's impact to total company results in the quarter wasn't as large as at other times of the year
5976,"Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are launching a new Kingsford Long-Burning Briquet, which will support the 2017 grilling season"
5977,"In cat litter, sales increased behind the Fresh Step with Febreze innovation we launched last calendar year"
5978,"And while the category remains highly competitive, we did have our third consecutive quarter of market share growth for the Scoopable Fresh Step franchise"
5979,"And lastly, results in the Household segment also reflect the Renew Life acquisition, which represented about half of the segment sales growth in the quarter"
5980,"Importantly, we remain very excited about this acquisition as we continue to gain new distribution, while driving share growth and we have a solid innovation pipeline planned for the second half of fiscal year 2017. Turning to our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%"
5981,"I'll start with our Burt's Bees business, in which sales grew mid-single-digits on top of a double-digit increase in the year-ago quarter"
5982,"Supported this year by innovation across our lip and face lines, such as strawberry lip balm and cleansing oil and strong sell-in on new offerings including glossy crayons, tinted lip oil, Flavor Crystals lip balm and eye makeup remover pads"
5983,"Burt's Bees second quarter market share reached an all-time high, reflecting the innovation I just noted as well as the strong core business"
5984,"Turning to our Food business, it also grew sales, driven by bottled Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and increased distribution of dry Hidden Valley products"
5985,"Recent product innovations continue to perform well, including new flavors of our ranch with bottled salad dressing such as sriracha, cucumber, and cilantro lime, as well as our Hidden Valley Greek Yogurt dressing"
5986,Market shares continue to grow behind all segments of our bottled and dry dressings
5987,"And further, we have a strong pipeline of innovation planned for the second half of the fiscal year including the launch of a preservative-free offering called Simply Ranch (12:02)"
5988,"Turning to our Brita water-filtration business, sales were about flat in the quarter, but looking ahead, we will continue to invest in marketing, PR and innovation"
5989,"And on the innovation front, in Q3 we will launch Brita Stream a Filter As You Pour system, making filtering water in a Brita pitcher 10 times faster"
5990,"We also introduced the Brita Longlast Filter, long last filter, which filters 120 gallons of water so it lasts three times longer than a traditional 40 gallon filter and reduces even more contaminants, including 99% of lead"
5991,"And then lastly, looking at our international business, volume increased 2% while sales decreased 2%"
5992,"Excluding the 10-point impact we saw in the quarter from unfavorable foreign currency, sales grew 8%"
5993,"Looking forward, we remain encouraged by our ability to execute price increases in key markets as well as our investments in Renew Life, particularly in Canada, Burt's Bees in Asia, e-commerce and innovation in our Laundry business across Latin America and in the Middle East"
5994,"In addition, our Go Lean strategy in international, which we've spoken to you about during the last year or so, is now yielding results as evidenced in the higher margins for the quarter"
5995,We're very pleased on our progress here as this will enable us to offset continued foreign currency headwinds as well as provide funds to continue investing in higher growth international businesses
5996,"So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our top line performance for the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date"
5997,"And based on our year-to-date performance, as well as our updated outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, we now anticipate full year sales growth in a range of 3% to 4% versus our previous outlook of 2% to 4%"
5998,"Although foreign currency remains a headwind, fundamentally our brands are healthy"
5999,We continue to support them with higher marketing support and we have more innovation across the portfolio coming in the second half
6000,"So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Robb to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook"
6001,"I think, Joe, this is Steve Austenfeld, just building on Steve's comments"
6002,I would point to two things in that all other line that helped not be as dilutive as has been in recent quarters
6003,"One is that foreign currency wasn't as bad on a year-over-year basis as it had been previously, so that helped"
6004,"And then secondly, the mix effect, which I think Steve talked about in response to an earlier question"
6005,Whereas we're still seeing some product mix related to some club volumes as we've discussed
6006,"We did have much more favorable business unit mix, mix across the franchise that helped us out there"
6007,And since you're looking at this gross margin reconciliation page and I appreciate you doing so and we've gotten a lot of questions on this
6008,"If you just fast-forward for a quarter or two and compare versus the second quarter, I think big picture – and there's always going to be movements across these different drivers, but for market movement, our prediction is it's going to start to be a little bit more dilutive, as we've said"
6009,We think commodities are probably going to rise after having certainly been a tailwind over the last year or so
6010,"But alternately, the manufacturing logistics line we think will become a bit more favorable"
6011,"So gross margin may still be challenged for a little bit in Q3. Q4 may look a bit better, but that's the way I'd look at this table in terms of the major drivers on this, in terms of what may change going forward"
6012,Why don't we take a question from one last caller?
6013,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast"
6014,Hershey's first quarter results were solid and I'm pleased with our performance
6015,"Net sales growth was 2.8%, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 2% sales growth, which we're happy with, given the choppy food industry retail trends in the U.S"
6016,and the macroeconomic challenges in some international markets
6017,"Gross margin was up nicely in Q1 and is expected to increase for the full year, fueling higher levels of advertising and other brand building initiatives"
6018,"Adjusted EPS was $1.31, a strong start to the year and puts us in a position to deliver on our commitments"
6019,The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is on track
6020,This will not be a big benefit to our 2017 results
6021,"However, this multiyear program should enable us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019 and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation"
6022,"Preliminary analysis of Easter data indicates that we had a good season with sell-through in line with estimates, putting us in a position to gain share in this important season"
6023,We believe this will result in total Hershey U.S
6024,"candy, mint and gum, or CMG, April year-to-date retail takeaway of about 2.5%"
6025,"While we don't like getting ahead of ourselves before results are final, given the timing of Easter, we thought this was an important metric to share"
6026,"retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending April 8, 2017, in the xAOC+C-store channels declined 7.9%"
6027,"As we stated on last quarter's conference call, first quarter net sales would be greater than retail takeaway due to Easter timing"
6028,"Recall that Easter occurred on April 16th in 2017 compared to March 27th in 2016. Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing, and therefore, noise in the data, is by looking at absolute market share results"
6029,"In the first quarter, we gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity"
6030,"In total, including the headwind from the year-ago seasonal activity, Hershey U.S"
6031,CMG market share increased plus 0.4 points
6032,"Our core power brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Ice Breakers, which had 2016 retail sales of $5 billion, continue to perform well"
6033,"In the first quarter, combined non-seasonal retail takeaway on these brands increased 5.6%"
6034,"Our Reese's NCAA basketball program and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, helped drive results"
6035,"While we're pleased with our first quarter market share gains, non-seasonal CMG retail takeaway was softer than we anticipated, resulting in Q1 net sales coming in less than our plan"
6036,"As you are all aware, Q1 marketplace performance across most of the U.S"
6037,food group was soft
6038,"While the perimeter continues to grow faster than center of the store, its growth rate also slowed"
6039,Our analysis points to several factors contributing to the softness
6040,"Some of them appeared to be Q1-specific, such as the tax refund delay while others are a continuation of the challenges like benefits inflation or channel shifting that we've been living with and we continue to solve for"
6041,"Additionally, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels was about the same as the year-ago period, although dollars per trip were down"
6042,Dollars per trip were better in March
6043,"And as I mentioned earlier, preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with our estimates"
6044,"We have a lot of variety, innovation and in-store programming over the remainder of the year as well as higher levels of advertising"
6045,We think categories within the snack wheel will outpace center of the store products given the impulsivity and percentage of merchandising and display allocated to snacks
6046,"As a result, we expect Hershey non-seasonal U.S"
6047,CMG marketplace trends to improve
6048,"However, given the uncertainty regarding overall U.S"
6049,"brick-and-mortar retail trends, our updated full year U.S"
6050,net sales growth rate is lower than our previous forecast
6051,"Looking at some of our 2017 activity, it starts with Hershey's CLC, which has gotten off to a good start"
6052,"In the first quarter, CLC net sales and marketplace results were in line with our estimates"
6053,"Internally, we refer to CLC as a vertical launch, as our goal was to attain 80% distribution by early February"
6054,We achieved this in eight weeks and had product available in all major channels to coincide with the beginning of TV and digital advertising
6055,The take-home stand-up pouch is doing very well followed by the king-size pack-type
6056,Sales by class of trade are tracking as expected
6057,C-store results are particularly strong with retail sales two times that of any other channel
6058,"While early, repeat purchases are tracking nicely"
6059,Although retail sales trends did slow in April given the Easter period as there's not a seasonal pack-type or packaging for this product yet
6060,"With the launch of Reese's and Hershey's Cookies 'n' Crème Crunchers, we are looking to expand our power brands to capture broader snacking occasions"
6061,Our research continues to show that snacking occasions have increased throughout the day
6062,The modern snacking model indicates 90% of consumers snack multiple times throughout the day
6063,"We expect that Crunchers will capture a portion of these snacking occasions as it combines powerful growing brands with sweet and crunchy textures to deliver a light, crisp eating experience"
6064,"The take-home stand-up bag is currently available at a few select retailers, and the instant consumable tubes will be available by the end of June"
6065,"We have a strong integrated Crunchers marketing plan to build awareness and trial, including a national FSI in Q3, in-store merchandising and display, as well as advertising"
6066,I'm also excited about the late Q2 launch of Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup
6067,The excitement of this launch started in February when the Reese's brand team started using social media to engage consumer with clues to a new chocolaty Cupspiracy
6068,"The team posted various graphics and videos to hype the followers; and in March, announced the upcoming launch of the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup, a peanut butter cup infused with crunchy pieces from a chocolate cookie"
6069,"This product, only available in an instant consumable pack-type, begins to ship in Q2. And I think you'll find that the crunchy cookie bits are a complementary texture with the peanut butter that makes it a very satisfying experience"
6070,"Additionally, our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products continue to do well, and we're leveraging some other equities as well such as ALMOND JOY and TAKE5. These items have enabled us to expand our breadth across the snack wheel and capture new usage occasions"
6071,That was just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America that we believe will grow our business over the remainder of the year
6072,"We feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment and go-to-market capabilities will enable us to deliver our full year net sales objective"
6073,"Snacks, which confectionery is a large part of, is performing better than many of the center of store categories, and we expect that to be the case going forward"
6074,Investments in the CMG category in the form of advertising and innovation are present from most major manufacturers
6075,"Therefore, given the high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points and solid margins, retailers continue to value the confectionery category"
6076,"As a result, we would expect the category to continue to secure key merchandising and programming space"
6077,"Now, for an update on our International and Other segment"
6078,"Net sales were essentially in line with our plan and on a constant currency basis up 4.2% versus the first quarter of 2016. I was particularly pleased with Mexico, Brazil, and India, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased a combined 15%"
6079,"In Mexico, our chocolate retail takeaway increased solid double digits, although slightly less than the category growth of about 15%"
6080,"Constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing"
6081,"Sales were strong across all categories and brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates, Hershey's milk drink box, and Pelon Pelo Rico"
6082,Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO and Hershey's milk sticks are resonating with consumers and gaining traction
6083,"In Brazil, while preliminary, we estimate that the chocolate category increased 7% to 8%"
6084,"Our retail takeaway in Brazil was about two-and-a-half times the category growth rate, fueled by distribution gains on core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which were launched in the second half of 2016. As a result, in Q1, our market share in Brazil increased 0.6 points to about 4.5%"
6085,Constant currency net sales in India increased about 16%
6086,"Growth in the brands we're investing behind Hershey's branded syrup, spreads, and milk booster as well as Brookside, JOLLY RANCHER and SOFIT increased more than 50%"
6087,"The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan"
6088,"While small, this launch gives us exposure to a segment with above-average gross margin for the India business"
6089,"Importantly, the transition of the portfolio is enabling a higher-margin business, which should put us in a position to invest and win in the marketplace with a sustainable operating model"
6090,"As we end the second quarter in China, we'll begin to implement the Margin for Growth Program we discussed earlier this year"
6091,The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business
6092,Patricia will discuss and review the impact of our impairment test of China's long-lived assets
6093,"But the overall goal of this program is clear and will focus on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the company's supply chain and streamlining the operating model"
6094,"China chocolate category sales in Q1 were about flat versus a year ago, and better than our estimate"
6095,"This was similar to trends of other impulse products, which declined"
6096,"Given the typical inventory levels we had post-Chinese New Year and the soft category in March, the temporary plant closure of about three weeks to four weeks due to an unscheduled inspection by regulators did not have a big impact on our business"
6097,"Our chocolate business in China underperformed the market in the first quarter, with market share off one point"
6098,"As we right-size our business and portfolio over the next year or two, we're looking to prioritize cities, classes of trade, brands, and innovation to satisfy the needs of this dynamic market"
6099,"We're working closely with our local team, including our e-commerce group, which continues to show promise"
6100,"Now to wrap up, I'm excited about our future, and I believe The Hershey Company has a long runway ahead of it"
6101,"I'm supported by a great team of leaders, who have a lot of broad-based CPG experience"
6102,"As we've shared with you on March 1st, we know what we need to do to succeed"
6103,We are executing on our model to expand margins by reallocating resources to initiatives with a higher rate of return
6104,We're investing in capabilities like go-to-market and building on our intellectual capital while also leveraging our core power brands and equipping our organization with the resources and tools to win in the marketplace
6105,"These investments in growth and capabilities should put us in an advantage position to win with retailers and consumers, and ultimately, deliver on our financial commitments on our strategy of balanced top and bottom line growth and build shareholder value"
6106,"I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results"
6107,"Patricia, do you want to handle that one?"
6108,Absolutely
6109,"So as you know, we work closely with all of our retail customer partners"
6110,And I think we mentioned last July that we were partnering with CVS on some of the work that they were doing around evolving their store layouts
6111,And we partner with all of our retailers along those lines
6112,"And March 1st, we mentioned a different customer we're also working with those efforts on"
6113,"I guess how I would tell you to think about it is, we service a broad range of retail customers"
6114,They all have very different strategies
6115,"And as some of our customer partners are making certain decisions on portfolio regarding store layout or front end, we have other of our customer partners who are actually looking to add incremental space behind confection, who are looking to take some other non-durable goods off the front end and put increased consumables and edibles; either overall at the front of store or as they have built their self checkouts and they hadn't yet built impulse around those"
6116,So we feel good about the growth we're seeing in the marketplace in indulgent categories
6117,"And if you look at the growth in categories, in indulgence and better-for-you, we're seeing growth across both and we have several customers who are really looking to leverage that growth"
6118,"Good morning, David"
6119,"Thanks, David"
6120,"No, I would say two things"
6121,"First of all, if you think about year-to-date, a large part of the acceleration of growth was driven by Easter"
6122,"So, Easter is a big piece of what you see year-to-date"
6123,"At the same time, we really look at the impact of the slowdown that we saw in the total box in Q1. And we saw that have an impact on everyday"
6124,"So as we look at the balance of the year, we are looking for our everyday business to accelerate"
6125,And we believe that that takes to make for the back half of the year is very achievable
6126,We'll be looking at ensuring we have adequate investments
6127,So we'll actually have some higher levels of spending in the back part of the year to drive that acceleration in the form of advertising
6128,And we feel good about that
6129,"But a lot of it is that Easter, the big boost in Easter and we really are looking and calling for an acceleration of everyday as we go into the back part of the year"
6130,"If you – without getting in too many specifics, if you think about that year-to-date performance, you would see seasonal items grew about double digits"
6131,So think about that in that double-digit range
6132,"And if you look at our non-seasonal core power brands, kind of the biggest five brands, they were up mid-single digits"
6133,"So, obviously, there was a little bit of softness across some of the non-core piece of our portfolio"
6134,But really double-digit growth on seasonal is what's a big component of 2.5%
6135,"Yes, that's right"
6136,"So in the first quarter, trade was down as we lapped some incremental trade merchandising that we had shared with you last year"
6137,We made some big investments in incremental trade
6138,"And as we have constantly worked to optimize our blend across trade and advertising, we made some different decisions this year"
6139,"And yes, our advertising expense was closer to flat in Q1. And as we go out to the balance of the year, we'll see increases"
6140,"Good morning, Andrew"
6141,"So, we have continued to see some very strong growth on barkTHINS as we are still in the process of driving against expanding distribution and gaining trial amongst consumers on that franchise"
6142,"So, I would say given the big piece of the growth curve that we're on, on that business; we've continued to see very strong growth there"
6143,"And I think we mentioned that it was a pretty significant piece of growth for us in Q1. And as I look at KRAVE, we're continuing to feel good about the momentum that we are seeing there"
6144,So we've continued to gain share
6145,We feel good about where velocities are
6146,"Like any new brand, we're learning in terms of really optimizing how we make sure that we drive that hardest in the right – to the right consumers and into the right channels"
6147,"So, in some cases, we overextended distribution, and we've right-sized that a bit"
6148,But we continued to see very nice growth there
6149,So – yeah
6150,Our consumption and retail takeaway does not have to be at 2.5 points
6151,"So we're actually planning for the takes to make there to be less than that, closer to slightly below 2 points"
6152,"Yeah, exactly"
6153,In line with the takes to make on that sales end
6154,"And we anticipate that generally, our net sales and our takeaway are directionally pretty in line"
6155,So you're right that we had a big benefit in shipments in Q4 behind Cookie Layer Crunch
6156,"But as we look out to the back half of the year, across all the quarters, we think that we'll be relatively in line, plus or minus in that 0.5 point range"
6157,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Got you
6158,Okay
6159,Thank you
6160,Yeah
6161,That's a great question
6162,"I mean, obviously, we can't speak directly to pricing or any kind of foreshadowing around the pricing piece"
6163,But I would say that we think about all of those as very viable levers and probably even more so today than we did in the past
6164,"So I think you're right that price mix is something we aggressively have our teams focused on, which we can drive through, focus on pack-types, focus on channels, build it into the innovation"
6165,And I think perhaps that's a lever that we have not used as aggressively in the past
6166,"We've spoken to you before about our whole focus on strategic revenue growth management and a lot of that as well is about really maximizing that net price realization by really, really scrutinizing all of the investments we make in trade and getting the value equation right on every pack-type and brand"
6167,"So, we're putting more focus there than we have in the past"
6168,"Well, I guess I'd say if I think about the first part of the year, I'd look and say Easter drove a lot of sales"
6169,And there is some sourcing from Easter across the base portfolio
6170,"So, I think it's hard to look just at the everyday business trends because there's interaction there with Easter"
6171,"Certainly, I feel good about the fact that we have increased consumer investment as we go into the rest of the year, because we know that our category is very responsive"
6172,"We continue to get very strong lift, and I feel really good that that combined with the very strong innovation that we have this year and customers are very excited about consumers are – are really going to help to drive consumers to the category and really boost the everyday business"
6173,"So I would say, Pablo, we continue to see, if you at look category growth of various snack categories across the store that there is strong growth"
6174,There's growth in indulgence and there's also growth in health and wellness
6175,So I don't know that I see a greater acceleration
6176,We always start with the consumer in mind
6177,And we are delighted to delight consumers with our indulgent portfolio
6178,"At the same time, we've been a leader in choice and transparency, and we always want to provide options to consumers"
6179,Now our Hershey's Kiss was one of the first forms of portion control at 25 calories for a Kiss
6180,We led the smart labeling initiative in the industry
6181,So we are just constantly evolving and updating our portfolio to help to meet consumer needs as best possible
6182,Good morning
6183,"Yes, it was"
6184,It was consistent with the total box
6185,"If you look at every category in the box, the trend was the same across the board"
6186,"And as we mentioned in the comments, we think that there – I think everybody's been looking to say, okay, what was that factor that really drove that across the board, and common thinking tends to be the tax refund delay had a big impact"
6187,There were some lapping issues on a year-to-year basis
6188,And then there's some continued pressures
6189,But we feel good that we still see a rebound in March really
6190,And we are focused on watching that very closely going forward
6191,Yes
6192,And dollars per trip were actually up in March after having been down
6193,We have started to see that rebound and agree with that
6194,Nothing that we saw there at all
6195,Thanks for the question
6196,"Yeah, we continue to feel really good with the programs that we have on the core brands"
6197,"And so I think in terms of the continuing the growth on something like Reese's, it is continuing the news"
6198,And some of our incremental investments in advertising towards the back part of the year will be made against those core brands to continue to leverage the momentum
6199,"And then at the same time, we are absolutely focused on turning around and accelerating our growth trajectory on some of the other pieces of portfolio, namely on the non-chocolate sweets area"
6200,So we will be increasing our investment there
6201,"Although at the same time, we've right-sized those brands a bit"
6202,"So as Mark mentioned, SKU rationalization, there are some areas where we have extended those brands and we had items in the marketplace that just weren't productive or profitable"
6203,And so we made a decision to take the hit on pulling back on some of that
6204,But we do have teams very focused on accelerating the growth there
6205,And I think that's an opportunity for us going forward
6206,I don't really think it's not as well-positioned
6207,"I would say, I think that we have opportunities to just fix our execution on that piece of the portfolio"
6208,There was a little bit more competition from smaller players last year where they went really aggressively on price
6209,Some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin
6210,So I really think it's more about what we do versus that there's any kind of consumer trend issue there
6211,"So, let me start, and then I'll transfer it over to Patricia"
6212,There is almost no – there is no shipment impact from that timing of Easter
6213,"I mean, we shipped almost nothing in terms of Easter into the second quarter"
6214,So that's not an issue at all
6215,"And relative to the write-offs, we feel great about Malaysia"
6216,So the write-offs that we talked about are not at all related to Malaysia
6217,Okay
6218,Yeah
6219,We still feel good that we're in positive territory
6220,"Yeah, the quarters always come in a little bit different depending on the promotion and innovation calendar"
6221,But there's nothing that we'd be fallen off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter
6222,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Got it
6223,"So as part of our Margin for Growth and Margin Expansion Program, we've started immediately in terms of taking the necessary steps to reset our investment in that marketplace and make some of the tough decisions"
6224,"At the same time, the local teams have built very focused plans in terms of where we are focusing to grow and build a sustainable business model"
6225,So we are focused on multiyear program
6226,But beginning now to really focus on a couple of key provinces on our core portfolio and on a profitable mix of brands across the portfolio
6227,"As you all know, the cost structure in some of the channels in China have changed and so we are shifting to more profitable channels and really try to capture some of the growth both in the second and third tier cities as well as e-commerce"
6228,So it's a multi-year program that's underway now and I'd say we can continue to update you as the year goes on
6229,"I mean, I think for competitive purposes, we prefer not to go into all of the details"
6230,"But we can give some thoughts to you, what we can share that might help you as you're building your model"
6231,We see – we've done very well with online e-commerce in China
6232,"As it's a big piece of the marketplace, it's been a nice growth driver for our business"
6233,"We've continued to see nice growth there and it is clearly amongst the channels, probably our number one area of focus from a channel perspective in that marketplace"
6234,So we have – we've built some infrastructure and that will continue to be a place that we'll want to invest in China going forward as in the U.S
6235,"Thank you, Matt and good morning, everybody"
6236,I'll start with EPS
6237,"Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 per share compared to $0.43 in 2016, down 4.7% after excluding a $0.12 per share charge related to the previously announced UK pension settlement"
6238,"The $0.41 was better than our $0.37 outlook, largely due to our better margins in international and SPD business, some help from tax, slightly higher sales and lower SG&A spending"
6239,"Reported revenues were up 2.3% to $898 million, organic sales were 1.8%, at the high end of our 1% to 2% range"
6240,"Organic sales growth was driven by our international consumer business, and our SPD division"
6241,"Now, let's review the segments"
6242,The Consumer Domestic business' organic sales were flat as couponing and promotional investments impacted net sales growth
6243,"Growth in ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergents, OXICLEAN laundry detergent and stain fighters, BATISTE dry shampoo, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was offset by declines in XTRA laundry detergent, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kits and TROJAN condoms"
6244,We expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 2% for the Consumer Domestic business
6245,"International organic growth was up an impressive 7.4%, driven largely by FEMFRESH and BATISTE in the export business and ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, STERIMAR, OXICLEAN stain-fighter in Mexico and BATISTE, VMS and FEMFRESH in Australia"
6246,"So, just broad based growth across the globe"
6247,We now expect the full-year organic sales to be approximately 7% for the international business
6248,"For our Specialty Products division, organic sales were up 9.4%, due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business"
6249,Milk prices and U.S
6250,dairy farm profitability remain at a higher level than a year ago
6251,We are raising our expectations for the full year for the SPD division from up 2% to 3% to up approximately 6%
6252,Turning now to gross margin
6253,"Our adjusted second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, an 80-basis point decrease from a year ago"
6254,"This was a bit better than we'd originally expected, largely due to continued productivity improvements and better margin on the international and SPD side"
6255,The Q2 gross margin decline breaks out as follows
6256,"We had higher promotional levels in Q2, which resulted in a drag of 180 basis points, gross margin improvement of 70 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, and productivity net of commodities was worth about 30 basis points of improvement"
6257,Moving now to marketing
6258,Marketing as a percent of revenue hit a recent high of 14.6%
6259,"Remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that we were beefing up Q2 marketing"
6260,"Historically, big quarters were Q2 and Q4, this year Q2 and Q3 to better support innovation"
6261,"SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a 460-basis point increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement"
6262,"On an adjusted basis, SG&A was up 13% – was 13% of sales up 20 basis points, primarily due to increased amortization from acquisitions"
6263,Now to operating profit
6264,"The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18.1%, which was 190 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to the marketing shift and higher promotional spending"
6265,"Other expense was $6.4 million, primarily driven by $9.5 million of interest"
6266,Next is income taxes
6267,Our effective rate for the quarter was 33.1% on an adjusted basis
6268,"Turning to cash, we generated approximately $250 million of net cash for the first half, a $47 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital, which was a function of a $30 million increase in deferred incentive comp plus higher inventories"
6269,This was partially offset by higher cash earnings
6270,"So, in conclusion, the second quarter highlights include strong share growth driven by our investments in our domestic business, continued strong growth in international and a return to growth in our Specialty Products segment"
6271,"Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 organic sales growth of 3.5% which reflects the consumer domestic business growing at approximately 3%"
6272,"Just a remainder 2016 growth was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, therefore the second half of 2017 will benefit from easier comps"
6273,"On a two-year stack basis, the first and second half are consistent at around 5%"
6274,Gross margin is expected to contract in Q3 with increased levels of promotion and coupon investments
6275,"We expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be significantly higher year-over-year, with the shift from Q4 to Q3 to continue our innovation support"
6276,"We expect third quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.46, compared to $0.47 a year ago, or a 2% decrease year-over-year, which includes $0.02 of dilution from the Water Pik acquisition"
6277,The primary drivers of the decrease are higher marketing in support of our new product launches and higher consumer promotional spending
6278,"As we end the year, we expect strong earnings growth in Q4, as heavy coupons around new product trial peels off, and the marketing goes back to normal levels"
6279,"And now, turning to the full year, and as I go through these metrics please keep in mind that we are excluding any impact from Water Pik"
6280,"We're maintaining our expectations for organic sales growth of 3%, we maintain our gross margin improvement guidance of 40 bps improvement year-over-year"
6281,Our full-year marketing expectations is approximately 12% of sales consistent with prior years
6282,"Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points improvement, when adjusted for the pension and Brazilian charges"
6283,"Other expense is expected to be around $31 million, primarily driven by interest expense, which does not include any interest expense from the Water Pik acquisition"
6284,And the tax rate is expected to be around 33%
6285,"On a reported basis, we continue to expect EPS to be $1.79, which includes the $0.01 negative impact from the Brazil charge and a $0.12 negative impact from the pension settlement and no impact from the Water Pik acquisition"
6286,"Excluding those items, we expect to achieve 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share"
6287,"And as mentioned previously for the full-year, we expect no net impact from the Water Pik acquisition"
6288,"To wrap up, we expect approximately $605 million of free cash flow, net of approximately $45 million of CapEx for the full year"
6289,This represents an excess of 120% free cash flow conversion
6290,We also have some good news on the pension settlement front
6291,We were able to beat our original expectations of settlement costs and we have no further pension risk or volatility to worry about as a company
6292,So now Matt and I will open it up for questions
6293,Question-and-Answer Session
6294,Yeah
6295,"And the only thing I'd add to that Dara is, of the 600-basis point drag on a price mix perspective, about a third of that was to drive new products and trial"
6296,"So, again it's not going to repeat forever"
6297,I'll let Matt talk about a macro perspective but for us it's also some of the comps Dara
6298,In the first half of 2016 we as a company grew 4%
6299,"And so, in the first half of this year, it's around 2%"
6300,"So it's the inverse of that in the second half, we grew at about around 2% in 2016, and 4% is our expectation in 2017. So a couple of our big categories like vitamin and laundry, that's what the comps are for the prior year"
6301,"I'll take that, Kevin"
6302,"It's a couple of things, really"
6303,"Domestic, we brought down slightly"
6304,"Personal care in the front half was negative in the quarter especially, but we believe that's going to turnaround because of the comps and other category growth in the back half"
6305,So we feel good about that
6306,"To the degree that we get any benefits from FX, remember we're typically spending that back"
6307,"So to be blunt, our marketing line will probably go up slightly versus our previous expectations"
6308,So we just reinvest that if we need to
6309,"So I guess, that's a short answer"
6310,"Kevin, I'll take the first part maybe"
6311,"P&G and everybody always continues to, it's a promotional category, laundry is always a promotional category"
6312,"But in the long term, if you take a step back, what's happening at the end of the day, the premium tier usually wins with innovation and the value tier wins because of value and the mid-tier shrinks"
6313,"I would say that's no different than what's been happening for the last 52 weeks, 26 weeks and 13 weeks"
6314,"And so, if they promote a little bit more, that's usually the higher end"
6315,"So, I've got three questions here"
6316,I'll take the first one
6317,"Really, it's all relative to your perspective, Steve"
6318,"I mean for us, we aren't outspending the competition, and I'll give you a couple of facts"
6319,"For the quarter, our amount sold on deal for laundry detergent was 36%"
6320,On average the category was 35%
6321,"For couponing, this is more of a limited measurement, but our data says we're around 30% and the category is around 27%, 28%"
6322,"So, maybe we're a basis point two or higher"
6323,"For a long time, we've kind of held back, but I think we are not making the situation worse, we're just getting up to par with our competition"
6324,"As Matt said, some of the personal care items are down"
6325,So it just looks like the negative drag on price mix because some of our household businesses have higher trade rates
6326,So I think that's part of it
6327,"I think and the other part, it's probably some of these trial activities are very enticing for the consumer"
6328,"And so, when that happens, the volume goes up, but also price – the negative price mix goes up right along with it"
6329,"So, that's kind of what happened I think in both cases"
6330,"Hey, Jason"
6331,"Yeah, sure"
6332,"I'll start with that one and then go into the, kind of the outlook again, but in my script I said we had a drag of about 180 basis points on promotional spending, with negative price mix, mainly negative price"
6333,"We had a 30 basis point drag from commodities, plus 60 basis point on productivity and then we had around 80 basis points of help from acquisitions and divestitures to get to the minus 80 basis points for the quarter"
6334,And so we're essentially flat to slightly up for the first half
6335,"I think as you look at the second half, there's a few things going on"
6336,"Number one, some of that new product trial, the deep couponing kind of that peels off as you get the repeat purchases without all the promotional activity"
6337,"So, that's a good thing for gross margin"
6338,I think our productivity pipeline continues to improve
6339,"Commodities, the drag gets a little less in the second half as we start to lap some of the negativity we had in the back half of 2016. I think, the personal care question you raise is a fair one, but I think more than anything, it's more of a comp analysis"
6340,"Again, a good example of that is just this, the VMS business was very promotional in the first half of 2016 as well because we were winning back the consumer because we were out of stock in 2015. And so we don't have that level of promotion"
6341,"Is the category maybe a little bit more promotional, yes"
6342,"But, year-over-year it still won't comp that"
6343,"So, hopefully that helps"
6344,"Okay, Andrea"
6345,"So, there is a couple of questions in there"
6346,"The first is on Water Pik, you're exactly right"
6347,It's flat for the full year
6348,"We have a $0.02 drag in Q3, largely because of the transactional and transitional expenses and not a full quarter worth of earnings"
6349,And then a plus $0.02 for the fourth quarter and flat for the year
6350,"Your second question, so that implies with our Q3 outlook, that implies a 20% growth rate in earnings in Q4. You're exactly right, that's really two things, 20% is around $0.09 and that's really two things"
6351,"One is that half of it is the shift of marketing that we've been talking about all year long, right we said we're going to move a lot of our Q4 spending into Q2 and Q3 to better line up with our new product launches"
6352,That's about half of it
6353,"The other half is, as we've mentioned before we have a better organic growth rate in the back half of the year, so and some gross margin improvement"
6354,"So, those are the two things driving 20% growth"
6355,And then the third question you had was a 400 basis point drag in couponing
6356,"Now remember a year ago – that's not just couponing by itself, it's also couponing trade spends and plotting and what not"
6357,"So, it's a little lumpy in 2016 compared to 2017. I'd tell you that we have some promotional spending throughout the balance of the year, but it's not like we're pulling everything back and we hope we're going to continue to do great without spending"
6358,"Like we said before, we're hitting our levels right at our competition"
6359,I understand
6360,The biggest driver is actually mix right
6361,"We've said in the first half of the year, part of that 400 basis points drag is personal care, right"
6362,And so we expect personal care to be better in the second half right
6363,"My answer to Lauren was part of the reason we have a negative price mix, when you look at organic growth is because we have more household increase and then personal care declining"
6364,And so just as that naturally balances back out that will improve the negative drag on the price mix line too
6365,And the laundry category is only up around 1% or 1.5%
6366,So it's not like the consumption was sky high
6367,"No, Olivia, we still have growth in untracked channels, we're not lapping any big gains or anything like that"
6368,"We still have growth, it's just the biggest driver is between the Nielsen data and even when you add in the untracked stuff is the negative drag from couponing"
6369,And there is a little bit of retailer inventory shifts but the primary driver is the gross to net couponing stuff
6370,"Thank you, Gerald"
6371,Our performance this quarter was in line with our expectations despite challenging conditions in a number of our markets
6372,We were particularly pleased with growth in U.S
6373,pharmacy volume and market share as the early benefits of our new pharmacy contracts started to come through
6374,We continue to work hard to secure regulatory clearance for the Rite Aid transaction and we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2017. So now let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter
6375,"As we expected, currency again had a negative impact, the U.S"
6376,dollar being around 16% higher versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year
6377,Sales for the quarter were $29.4 billion down 2.4% versus the comparable quarter
6378,"On a constant currency basis, sales were up 0.9%"
6379,"Without the extra day in February last year, this would have been up 2.2%"
6380,"GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 20.5%"
6381,GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion up 14% and diluted EPS was $0.98 up 15.3%
6382,Adjusted operating income was $2 billion down 4.9% and constant currency was down 2.7%
6383,We estimate this would have been broadly flat taking into account the leap year impact
6384,"Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.5 billion, up 3.7% and in constant currency up 6.2%"
6385,Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.36 up 3.8% and in constant currency up 6.1%
6386,The adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen was 23.7%
6387,"This was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to reduced estimated annual tax rate associated with our current year pretax earnings, an incremental discrete tax benefits"
6388,Year-to-date the tax rate on the same basis was 24.5%
6389,"For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2017. I will not go through this in great detail but you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.94 up 3.7% versus the same period a year ago"
6390,Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $2.46 up 5.1% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis
6391,So let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA
6392,"Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $21.8 billion, up 1.5% over the year ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 2.4%"
6393,"As 2016 was the leap year, when we calculate comparable sales and prescription figures, we exclude the 29 February, 2016. Adjusted gross profit was $5.9 billion down 0.6% over the year ago quarter with the impact of the extra day in 2016 holding back growth and adjusted gross profit by over 1%"
6394,Lower retail gross profit was partially offset by an increase in pharmacy
6395,"Adjusted SG&A was 20% of sales, an improvement of 0.1 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter"
6396,Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was improved versus comparable quarters for 15 consecutive quarters
6397,"As a result of the lower adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin was down 0.5 percentage points of 7.1% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion down 4.9%"
6398,So now let's look in more detail at Pharmacy
6399,U.S
6400,Pharmacy total sales were up 3.7% mainly driven by increased retail script volume
6401,"We filled 246.7 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 5.9%"
6402,"On a comparable basis for stores which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 4.2% with scripts filled up 7.9%"
6403,This was the highest quarterly growth rate in more than seven years and was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and strategic pharmacy partnerships which we announced last year
6404,We are pleased both with the progress of Medicare Part D an early indications of the benefits derived from our new pharmacy contracts
6405,Within sales volume growth and brand inflation was partially offset by reimbursement pressure which was in line with what we had anticipated and by the impact of generics
6406,"Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.4%, up approximately 100 basis points over the year ago quarter"
6407,Total retail sales were down 2.7% on the same quarter last year
6408,This includes the impact of previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations and the impact of the leap day in the prior year
6409,Comparable retail sales were down 0.8% in the quarter and what was a challenging environment
6410,The claims in the consumables and general merchandize and personal care categories partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness and beauty categories
6411,Adjusted gross profit was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to the decline in sales
6412,"Despite the difficult market conditions, we were pleased with growth in our key categories"
6413,"This was reflected by our absolute performance, as well as recent market share gains"
6414,"Based on the latest Nielsen data for the 13 weeks ended 25 February, we gain share in the health and wellness, beauty and personal care categories"
6415,"However, we know there is more to do and after taking further actions to help drive future performance"
6416,"These include simplifying our product offering, further emphasis on our omni-channel capabilities, and expansion of our beauty differentiation program"
6417,"While still early in the journey, our own brands are performing well and currently represent over 15% beauty sales in our beauty differentiation stores"
6418,We have now recruited beauty advisors across more than 1800 stores which is helping to drive No7 sales and gross profit
6419,Repurchase levels of No7 products are been very encouraging and Soap & Glory has also got off to a good start
6420,"Following the successful introduction of No7 and Soap & Glory, we are planning to introduce another of our own brands Botanics, into our existing beauty differentiation stores in the next six months"
6421,"Looking ahead we are now developing plans to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar year"
6422,"So next, let's look at the progress of our cost transformation program"
6423,"In our previously announced cost transformation program, we set ourselves an ambitious target of delivering $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. I'm delighted to announce that we achieved this target ahead of plan"
6424,We now expect that the cumulative pretax charges associated with this program will be approximately $1.8 billion
6425,This is in line with our expectations with an expanded program was announced in April 2015. These costs are higher than we anticipated in October primarily as we now expect to close around 60 more stores
6426,The program will be completed as expected by the end of fiscal 2017 and the full benefits will be realized in future periods
6427,"We continue to expect but approximately 60% of the program costs will be in cash over time, the principle items being future lease obligations"
6428,So now let's look at the results of the retail pharmacy international division
6429,"Sales for the division were $3.1 billion, down 1.9% in constant currency again impacted by the leap year"
6430,Comparable store sales decreased 0.9% in constant currency
6431,Comparable pharmacy sales were down 3.7% on a constant currency basis due to decline in the U.K
6432,which is partially offset by growth in other markets
6433,comparable pharmacy sales were down 5.2% mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding
6434,Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.6% reflecting Boots growth in the U.K
6435,", Republic of Ireland, and Thailand"
6436,Within the U.K
6437,Boots comparable retail sales increased 0.7% versus the year ago quarter supported by solid December trading
6438,Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 4% in constant currency to $1.2 billion mainly due to lower pharmacy margins in the U.K
6439,reflecting the reduction in funding and the impact of the leap year - leap day in the prior year
6440,Adjusted SG&A in constant currency dollars was flat versus the year ago quarter
6441,However adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was 0.6 percentage points higher of 31% as a result of the largely fixed cost elements of the cost base
6442,Adjusted operating margin was 7.8% and 1.4 percentage points in constant currency
6443,"This resulted in adjusted operating income of $242 million, a decrease of 16.7% again in constant currency"
6444,So now let's look at our pharmaceutical wholesale division
6445,Sales for the division were $5 billion up 0.6% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis
6446,Growth was held back by the sale of Alliance Healthcare Russia in March last year and also by the leap year
6447,Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 5.2%
6448,This was behind the Company's estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales
6449,With challenging market conditions in Continental Europe partially offset by growth in emerging markets and the U.K
6450,Market growth is particularly strong in certain emerging markets due to the timing of price increases
6451,Adjusted operating margin which excludes ABC was 2.9% up 0.2 percentage points on a constant currency basis
6452,Adjusted operating income was $226 million up 59.4% in constant currency
6453,"Excluding the $79 million and adjusted earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 8.4% in constant currency reflecting procurement and cost benefits"
6454,Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.9 billion
6455,"During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $1.4 billion"
6456,"This reflected our seasonal reduction in inventories, as well as an improved receivables position"
6457,Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $261 million
6458,This was lower than in the first quarter mainly due to phasing
6459,"As I said last quarter, we continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and U.S"
6460,"beauty program, as well as the upgrades to our IT systems which we have previously talked about"
6461,This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.6 billion
6462,"Today, we announced a new share repurchase program of up to $1 billion in this calendar year with the flexibility to do this due to the changes to the pending Rite Aid transaction announced in January"
6463,"So turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we have maintained guidance and continue to expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.08. Remember our guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year and no material accretion from Rite Aid or from the new strategic alliance with Prime announced on Monday"
6464,So I’ll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments
6465,I mean on the particular program that we talked about today we obviously are very pleased to have achieved our target the program will conclude as we previously announced – around the end of this fiscal year
6466,Some of the benefits of that will obviously – it will continue to see and see more of in the coming years
6467,Given that nevertheless looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our sort of businesses is just a way of life
6468,So we will absolutely continue to look for opportunities year after year
6469,"They will come in different places they may be in different geographies, but there are always opportunities to drive efficiency"
6470,"And so it's just a never ending we’ll continue this program will finish, but we’ll continue to look for more opportunities"
6471,I think really it always looks at the year-to-date effective tax rate and if you look at that from an adjusted basis as I said that was around 24.5%
6472,"So I think tax obviously you know mix can change quarter-by-quarter but looking at year-to-date I think it’s perhaps the best way of thinking about this discrete items of course the timing of those, there was a little bit uncertain and they can go up or down but think of the year-to-date"
6473,I mean obviously we haven’t given specific guidance by segment we had first provide by reiterating our overall guidance figures I mean in terms of thinking about sort of the modeling
6474,There is going to be a number of factors that you've got to think about and firstly we will we are consolidating the new Prime deal from Monday when we completed it
6475,You need to think about that in factoring the U.S
6476,model recognizing obviously that is a specialty on mail business with different dynamics
6477,"In terms of the international businesses, I think as we've said in the prepared remarks there is still the challenge in the U.K"
6478,with the NHS having cut the reimbursement that will continue the basis has performed robustly as we said over key customer period
6479,But retailing is still itself quite challenging particularly in the U.K
6480,which is our largest market
6481,"And then on wholesale sales, wholesale always a its kind of business or division that operates in a number of markets you can always get certain mix affect quarter-by-quarter"
6482,So it's tough to model I know quarter-by-quarter but I did point out in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets we had some growth really in the period when you get price changes in the market where people tend to buy ahead of customers buy ahead of the price change and that was the notable impact in the second quarter
6483,Well just on the accounting side I mean we will account for it on a fully consolidated basis
6484,"So when you're looking at our of sales, our adjusted operating income then you will obviously see a 100% of the entities results coming through, but then when you're actually looking at an earnings attributable to our shareholders to the WBA shareholders, we strip out and align the proportion that is attributable to Prime itself and I think as we said we own just over 50% of the business"
6485,So when you thinking of EPS then it will be our share if you thinking of operating it's a 100% also in the accounting books
6486,Anything that goes through the venture that the new combined venture as to say we show a 100% in revenue 100% in adjusted operating income but then we strip as I say at the lower end of the P&L that the Prime share
6487,So when we are looking at adjusted earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance staffs got their share netted out
6488,"Good morning, everyone"
6489,The first quarter was certainly a challenging one for Kellogg North America
6490,We again delivered strong operating profit margin expansion
6491,"However, our top-line was not where we wanted it to be"
6492,John has already walked you through the unexpectedly soft consumption that was felt across our categories and across the entire industry
6493,"And, as he said, it appears that at least some of this was due to transitory factors that will not persist"
6494,We also had a notable decrease in trade inventories
6495,We knew that trade inventory would come out in Q1 and it did
6496,"During the quarter, we made good progress on productivity initiatives, investment in food and packaging and our DSD transition, which I'll come back to in a moment"
6497,"And we had strong commercial plans across our businesses for Q2 and the second half, though I'm confident that our sales performance will improve"
6498,"Let's briefly walk through each business, starting with the ones whose results came in largely as expected, and then moving to Morning Foods and Snacks, where the factors I mentioned were most acute"
6499,"I'll start with Specialty Channels on slide 13. Our Specialty Channels business in Q1 delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth, even against a tough year-ago comparison"
6500,"The net sales growth was delivered through equal parts of volume and price/mix, and via market expansion in core channels, as well as expansion in emerging growth channels, all of which was aided by innovation"
6501,"Operating profit margin continued to improve, driven by price, mix, as well as continued Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting savings"
6502,So we continue to feel good about Specialty Channels
6503,"Now we'll look at our North America Other segment on slide number 14. As we expected, this segment posted strong 8% profit growth in Q1 with margins improving substantially, up 200 basis points on the strength of Project K and ZBB savings"
6504,"In Frozen, Eggo consumption returned to growth in March"
6505,"With the removal of artificial ingredients and solid commercial plans, we expect better net sales performance in coming quarters"
6506,MorningStar Farms is a similar story
6507,Consumption turned to growth in March and our renovated line is now on shelf and being supported
6508,"So that should get gradually better, too"
6509,"At Kashi, trade inventory corrected, following innovation launches in late Q4. However, we continue to show good progress in our overhauled Cereal business, which continued to grow consumption in the natural channel and grew consumption in xAOC measured channels, too, with particularly encouraging gains for our bear naked brand"
6510,And we're just starting to get back on air with media
6511,We launched our new Nut Butter Bars in January
6512,Our early signs are good and we're following it up with further renovations and innovations in the second half
6513,"So Kashi is another business in which we expect to see gradual improvement as the year goes on, both in consumption and in net sales"
6514,"In Canada, we're still seeing the volume impact of our efforts to increase price realization in order to cover the steep transactional FX impact of a weakened Canadian dollar"
6515,We expect the impact to stabilize as we lap our pricing actions in the next couple of months
6516,So Canada is on track to meet expectations for the year
6517,"Now, let's turn to slide 15 and U.S"
6518,Morning Foods
6519,"Morning Foods' Q1 sales were affected by the category-wide consumption slowdowns in January and February, by trade inventory reductions coming out of Q4 and by the timing of our commercial plans"
6520,Performance across our core six brands was mixed
6521,Our kid brands grew consumption and share behind a strong performance of Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops
6522,"Cinnamon Frosted Flakes is the leading category innovation this year, and Froot Loops responded very well to its new Whatever Froots Your Loops campaign"
6523,"On the flipside, Special K and Mini-Wheats started the year in decline, largely due to the year-on-year timing of innovation and renovation"
6524,"Last year, both had important activity in Q1. While this year, both are set to launch new and renovated offerings during Q2. We expect quarterly sequential improvement in sales for cereal and share, driven by continued momentum in our kid brands and by the renovation, innovation, and new communication for the Special K and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, which are breaking here in the month of May"
6525,"We also have a major in-store event coming in late Q2 behind the movie release of Despicable Me 3. Pop-Tarts in Q1 continued to gain share in toaster pastries, driven by the successful launch of new Pop-Tarts Dunkin' Donuts flavors"
6526,We'll continue to drive this brand hard in the back half of the year with the launch of JOLLY RANCHER-flavored Pop-Tarts
6527,"So we expect gradual improvement in Morning Foods' sales performance in the coming quarters, while OP margin expansion will continue"
6528,"Now, let's talk about U.S"
6529,Snacks shown on slide number 16. Snacks had a tough quarter for the consumption and trade inventory reasons we've mentioned previously
6530,"Additionally, but not unexpectedly, we also experienced some initial order softness during the few weeks in February when we were informing our DSD employees of our exit"
6531,These factors combined to pull down net sales and operating profit in the quarter
6532,"The good news is that we continue to gain share in Crackers, led by our Big 3 brands"
6533,And we saw newly-supported Keebler gain share in Cookies
6534,"We also sustained share growth momentum in another focused brand for us, Rice Krispies Treats"
6535,So our underlying in-market business performance remains healthy
6536,And we feel good about what's coming in our commercial plans for the rest of the year
6537,"We've already launched Special K Snacks in Q1 and still transitioning that on shelf, but that will help us stabilize that brand"
6538,"As we transition out of DSD, we are ramping up brand-building support across key cracker brands, wholesome snack brands, and Pringles"
6539,"Q2 will see support behind our innovations as well as in-store promotions around Major League Soccer and the tie-in to the movie, Despicable Me 3. And going into the second half, our plan strengthens further with innovations behind Cheez-It, the renovation of Nutri-Grain and new single-serve pack-form adds across multiple categories, all of this supported by the incremental brand-building that is a key element of our transition to our new Go-to-Market Model"
6540,"This brings me to another important development in the quarter, our progress against the DSD transition"
6541,This is graphically depicted on slide number 16 (sic) [17]
6542,"Transition planning is well underway, driven by a multi-functional team and led by individuals that orchestrated our successful integration of Pringles"
6543,Joint business planning with customers has gone well
6544,And our retention of employees is on track
6545,And we've made numerous other elements of progress against a host of operational elements
6546,So we feel very good about our progress so far
6547,Portfolio optimization began in Q1 and will continue through the transition as we optimize the assortment for warehouse delivery and work down inventories
6548,"This will have an increasing impact on volume as the year goes on, but it facilitates the transitions this year and should contribute to a net improvement in velocity and profitability as we get into 2018. Customer transitions have begun, with the first of our customer base being converted here in Q2. This will trigger the first of the list price adjustments, which will have an increasing impact as more customers get converted across Q2 and Q3. Keep in mind that we already have a fully-functioning warehouse system that is both efficient and scalable and is ready for this transition"
6549,"Remember, though, most of DSD network will have to remain open through the transition"
6550,"The final exit, including the final head count and DC reductions, will happen as the last of the customers gets converted during Q4. That's when you will see the true benefit of the savings begin to come forward at their ultimate run rate"
6551,"So in summary for Kellogg North America, our top-line performance across the region was affected by softened consumption across most categories in the U.S"
6552,", as well as some shipment timing and some short-term issues that should be behind us"
6553,"Commercial plans get stronger in Q2, and we are making good progress on the DSD transition"
6554,And we continue to deliver strong improvement in our operating profit margin
6555,"With that, I'll turn it back to John for a look at the international regions"
6556,"Hey, Rob, Paul"
6557,"Yeah, Kashi"
6558,I will come to Kashi in a second
6559,"If you look across Crackers, Cookies, Pop-Tarts, Cereal, Frozen, and Kashi, consumption was higher than our shipments in every case"
6560,Okay? So it really was a significant impact
6561,"Again, more granular on something like Kashi, there's a big disconnect in cereal, in particular, partly because of the selling in of innovation at the end of last year, which we knew drove some inventory in"
6562,"The good news is, is the consumption is exactly where, if not ahead of where we planned"
6563,So we're seeing that come through in the first quarter and will normalize now as we go forward into the second quarter
6564,I want to dig deeper and give you a little bit of color maybe on Snacks
6565,"Snacks was off, as you can see, by about 6%"
6566,"Half of that, we think, is consumption-related broad-based trends in the marketplace"
6567,"As I said, we grew share in Crackers"
6568,We grew share in the Keebler Cookie brand
6569,Rice Krispies continues to do well
6570,"But the other half is things like the inventory decline, so planned SKU culls and a little bit of disruption around the, as John said, the transition as it relates to ordering, particularly in those two weeks when we spoke to our sales force about the future"
6571,"So you can see this disconnect come through just about in every one of our businesses, it gives us the belief it's transitory and things will get better"
6572,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you
6573,Here's how we see the status of the DSD transition
6574,"So far, everything is on track"
6575,And we're very happy with where we stand
6576,"If you step back, remember, what's driving this is a consumer and shopper-driven reason and a customer channel-driven reason"
6577,"Part of the orientation away to a pull model is that we will shift significant resources to brand-building behind those, what I would call, invest-to-grow brands, particularly within Snacks, brands like Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, for example"
6578,Our warehouse model is more effective and efficient
6579,We already ship through warehouses
6580,We deliver better service and higher in-stocks and it offers us better joint value creation with our customers as we come through on one platform
6581,"As far as the shelf is concerned, we're deliberately leaning in to optimize our assortment, so we can make the shelf work harder"
6582,"And so we are looking proactively to make sure that we have our fastest moving, biggest brands, where the investment is going to go, on shelf"
6583,We're not looking to lose space
6584,We're looking to optimize our shelf so it can work harder
6585,"Within our customer discussions, so far, there is broad-based agreement that this is the future of delivery in these kinds of categories"
6586,And we're working through how we achieve it in the near-term
6587,So we've had generally very good support for the move
6588,"Specifically on brand-building, as I alluded to, you will see the brand-building ramp up here as we go through Q2, Q3, and Q4. It is really important as we go through this transition that we have strong plans in market to ensure shelf presence, display presence and we've got big things to sell behind"
6589,"So as you look at our Snacks business year to go, we do have a double-digit increase in brand-building coming on crackers, wholesome snacks and Pringles"
6590,We have renovation of the core Nutri-Grain business and brand
6591,We have a big range of seasonal innovations across cookies and wholesome that will drive fun and excitement and display in store
6592,We have Cheez-It innovation coming in the back half
6593,"And we have lots of new pack formats across crackers, cookies, and wholesome snacks to drive incremental consumption in new occasions"
6594,And a lot of those packs will exist in the mainstream retail environment as well
6595,So we have a pretty packed program of things to come that will drive excitement in the category and we'll benefit from the brand-building as we put it in in the back half of the year
6596,"I can't give you a quantification today, David"
6597,But what you're saying is what we're doing
6598,We are eliminating tail where it doesn't make sense
6599,And we're looking to prioritize and maximize assortment against the biggest things we have
6600,"And so when I talk about putting more brand-building in behind brands like Cheez-Its and Rice Krispies Treats, et cetera, we are making sure that we have the most efficient and effective assortment to drive our business harder going forward"
6601,"But there is a degree of SKU rationalization, and we've leant in proactively on that"
6602,"Hey, Josh, I can't go into detail on price or anything that you call the give-backs"
6603,But I can tell you that the discussions with retailers have gone well
6604,"And within the context of the plans we put together going in, so far so good"
6605,"Yes, Josh, I think it would be fair to say there is always pressure from our retail partners to keep prices low"
6606,"If you look at the data we see, you see there's not a lot of massive deflation going on in our categories right now"
6607,We have seen a little bit of push from private labels in selected categories
6608,Frozen would be one
6609,"We've see private label items come up, and we've also seen our Eggo items come up, which suggests that there are factors going on there"
6610,"And the retail environment is changing to adapt to consumer needs, quite frankly"
6611,"And so we're seeing growth on the fringes of retail in all kinds of places, just incumbent on us to be more agile with the right food in the right format at the right price, depending on those retail environments"
6612,But the pressure is the same as it's always been
6613,"Yes, we see the improvement coming sequentially across the year"
6614,"A far as the Snacks business is concerned, obviously, I'm not sure we'll see incremental volume or price pressure, as John alluded to"
6615,"As part of the transition, our retailers will actually get more margin here"
6616,And we have great plans to pull coming through in brand-building
6617,"So we will see some deflation of pricing because of the net sales impact, but overall underlying velocities, there's going to be a lot of volatility"
6618,But we're still going to execute our plan
6619,"I think some of that 50% or so, half of it being consumption decline, was related to the January, February impacts that I think the entire industry felt"
6620,We're not anticipating those declines to become the norm
6621,I think they were transitory in nature
6622,And so we feel very confident that snacking categories are ripe for growth going forward
6623,"Specifically to Kashi Snacks, we launched two Nut Butter Bars at the beginning of the year here, and so far so good"
6624,The pickup has been better than we expected
6625,We have more listings to come in the back half around nut butters
6626,"We're also fully renovating our chewy bars here at the end of the second quarter, moving into the third quarter, and the food is significantly preferred, so we have a real upgrade coming on our chewy bars"
6627,So that's the innovation and renovation
6628,"We've just gone back on air with new advertising which features the bars here in March, April, so"
6629,And that will continue through Q2 and Q3. So we are on track to deliver what we expected this year
6630,"Now as we've said, on Kashi bars in particular, we expected growth on cereal this year from a consumption point of view"
6631,That is our outlook
6632,"On bars, we expected to dramatically decline the rate of decline, if you like"
6633,"So we're not expecting growth, but we are expecting a much lower rate of decline, in the single digits"
6634,"And so far, we're on track and we feel good with the uptake of these new bars"
6635,"In terms of points of distribution on bars, we are seeing going into the second half of the year, a stabilization as it pertains to points of distribution, which is positive because we hadn't seen that over the past couple of years"
6636,"So with a bit of luck and a bit of hope and a bit of good execution, we're bottoming out here and we can start to look forward on snacks"
6637,"Specifically to Kashi, Michael, or to the"
6638,"Granted, we expect it to come across all of our businesses, as I mentioned, that we see consumption disconnected from shipments in just about every category"
6639,So we expect improving consumption on cereal through the back half of the year
6640,"We expect it on cookies and crackers from a velocity point of view, Pop-Tarts"
6641,"Frozen, we're anticipating getting back into growth"
6642,"Kashi Cereal, we're looking to see that consumption growth come through in our business"
6643,"Specialty, we expect to maintain the momentum we've developed"
6644,"And in our Canadian business, we're going to lap, as I said, the pricing interventions from a year ago soon, and we expect an improving performance there as well"
6645,So it really is broad-based
6646,"We don't give quarterly indications, but we have factored in, obviously, a degree of an inventory build and a transfer here through the second and third quarter, which will be offset by some other factors as the year goes on"
6647,"So as John, I think, might pick it up, we'd originally factored in the impact to the company in the year from this"
6648,"It's Paul, David"
6649,The Special K Cereal business has actually flattened out pretty much and held or grown share in the last two years
6650,"The impact in Q1 was really down to a timing of innovation activity, and we have all of that lined up to start and it's starting here in May, as we speak"
6651,"So the Cereal business, you picked it up"
6652,"If we're going to win and drive this category forward, our Core 6 needs to fire on all cylinders"
6653,And K needs to do better in the back half
6654,We think we have the plans to do that
6655,"Our kid brands momentum will continue, specifically with wholesome snacks"
6656,There's more than Special K to wholesome snacks
6657,"Rice Krispies Treats continues to grow, and we look to accelerate that"
6658,Nutri-Grain has significant renovation coming as well
6659,"And then the Special K transition is underway, with better food and we'll benefit from the new campaign across the entire brand"
6660,So we expect an improving trend in Special K bars as part of our wholesome snack business year to go
6661,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone"
6662,I will start on slide 5 and our U.S
6663,I think George covered off the key macro drivers
6664,"In the end, we saw favorable pricing primarily in cheese that was more than offset by the volume/mix decline from consumption weakness across categories"
6665,"Foodservice, cheese, meats and nuts were the categories most affected and they offset ongoing solid gains from Lunchables, frozen meals, and macaroni & cheese"
6666,"Moving to EBITDA, we had incremental Integration savings, just less than $100 million"
6667,"Note that in Q1, the pace of net savings versus the prior year was consistent with our expectations and we do expect that pace to pick up more in the second half of the year"
6668,"In the first quarter however, the incremental savings together with pricing were more than offset by both the decline in volume/mix and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable key commodity costs in coffee and bacon"
6669,"Although I would note that, versus last year, adjusted EBITDA was down only 1.4%, considering we were up against significant key commodity costs favorability in Q1 last year"
6670,Let's turn to slide 6 and Canada
6671,"Bernardo mentioned, Canada's Q1 results versus the prior year were significantly impacted by later-than-usual go-to-market agreements with key retailers"
6672,As a result (16:03) was a double-digit decline in volume/mix from a combination of reduced in-store activity and a related decline in shipments
6673,"At EBITDA, we had a slightly greater percentage decline than what we saw in organic net sales, reflecting the volume/mix decline and change to promotional levels versus the prior year"
6674,"That being said, I think there are three important factors to consider as we move forward"
6675,"First, we had significantly favorable pricing relative to local input costs within Q1 EBITDA last year"
6676,"Second, despite the headwinds seen in this Q1, Canada's adjusted EBITDA growth is still in the double-digits on a two-year basis"
6677,"And third, we are confident that the new go-to-market agreements we've reached in Canada will lead to a resumption of run rate trends in growth and profit margins for the balance of the year"
6678,"That brings us to Europe on slide 7 where we saw sequential improvement in overall organic growth, including top-line growth in the UK"
6679,"Strong currency headwinds continued to be a factor in reported results and net pricing declined due to timing of promotional activity, primarily in UK and Italy"
6680,Volume/mix growth was driven by gains in UK condiments and sauces and this was partially offset by weakness in Italy infant nutrition as well as soup and beverage in Netherlands
6681,"Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the UK gives us the confidence that the business is on the right path, and that our investments with retailers in the second half of last year are now paying off"
6682,"At adjusted EBITDA, we had solid constant currency gains from strong cost favorability, mainly manufacturing savings that more than offset unfavorable input costs in local currency driven by transactional currency headwinds"
6683,"Going forward in Europe, while we expect further improvement to our performance in the marketplace and across geographies, we expect Q2 organic top line and EBITDA to be held back by two factors: one, is shipments phasing versus the prior year where some July shipments were pulled into June last year; the second is the likelihood of unfavorable product costs as we will continue to face transactional foreign exchange headwinds within our supply chain in the near-term"
6684,"Finally, let's look at our Rest of the World segment on slide 8 where results were consistent with expectations we laid out on our last call"
6685,"Specifically, our plan for 2017 called for us to go after growth opportunities aggressively and would include significant incremental investments in marketing, go-to-market capabilities and product development that would hold back margins"
6686,And Q1 reflected the first stage of this plan
6687,"At volume/mix, we had positive on base performance in both China and from condiments and sauces in Latin America"
6688,We also had favorable shipments related to the timing of Ramadan in Indonesia that were offset by actions we took to realign our distributor network in several countries and mainly affected our exports business
6689,"In the end, we are encouraged by seeing our investments paying off, from condiments and sauces across Latin America, and on a more local basis, a strong organic growth in China, India, Korea, and the Middle East and Africa"
6690,"At EBITDA, the strong contribution from volume/mix growth was offset by two factors: one, significant commercial investments in marketing and sales to drive top-line growth in our EMEA region; and two, higher input costs in local currency, particularly affecting our business in India, Egypt and Nigeria"
6691,"Looking forward, while we expect our investments to continue as a headwind to EBITDA through the second quarter, we also expect organic sales growth to accelerate from Q1 levels as the year progresses"
6692,"That concludes our review of Q1 results, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of the year"
6693,"To begin, there is no doubt that the headwinds we've highlighted before will remain, from highly competitive retail markets to persistent foreign exchange headwinds, especially in Europe here in Q2. But these factors are likely to affect everybody in our industry, not just Kraft Heinz"
6694,"That said, we are expecting profitable organic sales growth to ramp up as the year progresses, especially in the second half"
6695,"Why do we believe this? First, as George noted, we have a much stronger retail calendar in the U.S"
6696,"for the balance of the year, beginning with better retail events in Q2. Second, we expect and have already being seeing our restoration of normal go-to-market activity in Canada, including our innovation and marketing agendas in light of having completed all agreements with key retailers"
6697,"And third, we expect the positive investment-driven consumption trends in Europe, Latin America and Asia, Middle East and Africa to continue"
6698,"At the profit line, we still expect the progression of our 2017 results to reflect aggressive up-front investment in growth and favorable commodity trends to be followed by a step-up in cost savings in the second half of the year"
6699,"We are on track to deliver the $1.7 billion in cumulative Integration Program savings, net of inflation and business investments in North America by end of 2017. We do, however, have significant work ahead of us in order to deliver our plan"
6700,"We must continue to execute our footprint related manufacturing line start-ups, which are well underway"
6701,We have an extensive pipeline of Big Bets innovations in whitespace in Q2 and throughout the second half of the year
6702,"And we will keep our focus on our defined strategy of investing, in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market capabilities as we ramp up the savings and efficiencies within our business"
6703,"In the end, we continue to expect 2017 will be another year of sustainable profitable growth for The Kraft Heinz Company and another significant step forward in realizing our potential"
6704,"And now, we'd be happy to take your questions"
6705,Question-and-Answer Session
6706,"Hi, Ken"
6707,"Hi, this is Paulo"
6708,"So, I don't remember we mentioning it during the call, but in terms of the gross margin, which is pretty much flat year-over-year, it's kind of encouraging to us given the commodity headwind that we had this quarter comparing to the prior year's first quarter"
6709,And also the geographic mix that we have this year with the decline of the higher margin business in North America
6710,Sure
6711,So if you think about – just let me step back to give more color on the main impacts we had in the quarter
6712,"So pretty much our North America EBITDA declined around $40 million, $45 million"
6713,The main impact we had was driven by volume mix
6714,"And this impact offset the savings initiatives around the $100 million that we have, additional savings, and the pricing we got in the quarter"
6715,So pretty much we had the commodity headwinds we faced this quarter being really responsible of the fact that the EBITDA decline
6716,"Prior year, in the same quarter, we had a much bigger favorability than that, almost twice this size if you go back to Q1 2016."
6717,"So, yes, you're right"
6718,I think the majority of the cash declines we had was pretty much driven by typical seasonal working capital
6719,Q1 is a quarter that we normally lose a lot of working capital due to seasonality in that
6720,"And on top of that, we had inventory increase to prepare because we are preparing for all the footprint activities we are going to execute during the year"
6721,So the majority of this is just the timing and we expect to recover in the following quarters
6722,We're still seeing that and we've said that before that we would have had investments in the Rest of the World business
6723,The growth is coming and we expect the growth even to ramp up going forward
6724,"And I think to better answer the questions, we're still seeing the margin there is around 20% being representative of the margin that we're going to see in this unit going forward"
6725,So it's pretty much what I was saying
6726,So we expect these investments happening in the first half of the year in Rest of the World
6727,And we expect this pay off and start seeing better margins going back to the normal margins of the business in the second half of the year
6728,That's the second stage in that we're seeing those investments
6729,"Hi, Andrew"
6730,This is Paulo
6731,"So, to think about – the way that we think about our M&A framework, which hasn't changed since the beginning, and the framework is pretty much that we want to own brands that we'd be happy owning these brands for the long run, brands with strong equity, strong relative market share, brands that can travel"
6732,"But we also analyze a lot how the business operates, the go-to-market of the business, and more important than that, how the business operates better, how they would operate better, how they grow fast being together"
6733,"Okay? And, of course, doing this analysis, we take everything into consideration, including all the synergies that we have, all the options that we have in terms of getting a better performance"
6734,"And, again, everything that you said is always to improve our portfolio, right, when we have this type of framework"
6735,"And more important and also very important is that we're always going to be very, very disciplined on price"
6736,"Hi, Andrew"
6737,"So, it's Paulo again"
6738,"So when we're entering the second year of integration, it's much better to track for cumulative savings than trying to track a run-rate, given the structure of our savings that is net of inflation and net of investment"
6739,So we ended the prior year at $1.2 billion cumulative savings
6740,We are ending this first quarter at $1.2 billion level and we said that and we're still in the path to get to $1.7 billion
6741,"So, out of the $500 million that we expect to deliver this year additional, we delivered $100 million in the first quarter"
6742,"And again, we still have $400 million to deliver going forward in the next three quarters"
6743,"And again, you're right that we said that we expect additional savings – the majority of the savings to be in the second half"
6744,"So hi, Pablo"
6745,"So, on the first question – and let me start from there"
6746,"So, the first question was about"
6747,"So according to divestiture of the brands, today we feel comfortable with the brands and the capital that you operate"
6748,We think we have scale and we operate well there
6749,"Again, as soon as if we decide to divest any categories or any brand in any specific geography, we will communicate this properly to the market"
6750,"So related to the Unilever potential transaction, we really believe that as I said in the M&A framework it's kind of – again, if you go back here in terms of only consumer brands, brands with a strong market share, brands that can travel, similar go-to-market, similar operation, I think at the end of the day that these two segments of the consumer product goods are very similar and that's the reason why you see also many companies operating brands for consumers, sometimes food, sometimes personal care, sometimes healthcare"
6751,Thank you
6752,"Good morning, everyone"
6753,"Earlier today, we announced record first quarter results of $0.44 per share, up 2% from last year"
6754,Sales for the quarter were down 1% on a 2% decrease in volume
6755,Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 5%
6756,"For the quarter, three of our five segments reported earnings growth"
6757,"Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products grew earnings, while Specialty Products earnings were flat"
6758,Jennie-O Turkey Store had a difficult quarter versus last year with earnings down 25%
6759,Sales were up 13% and volume was up 22% compared to last year
6760,Segment profit margins declined from over 24% in the first quarter last year to 16% this year
6761,"As a reminder, last year, we made dramatic shifts to product mix and cut operating expenses as we managed through avian influenza and a substantial decrease in volume through our system"
6762,"As we communicated during our fourth quarter call, we knew the first half of the year faced difficult earnings comparisons"
6763,"However, the erosion in market conditions was deeper and faster than we expected"
6764,"Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store's profitability this quarter: declining turkey prices, increased expenses and increased competition"
6765,"We can handle any one of these issues during a given quarter or year, but all three factors in the same quarter created a difficult operating environment that we did not expect"
6766,"First, turkey prices such as breast meat have fallen over 60% year-over-year to seven year lows, which were much lower than we expected"
6767,"Jim Sheehan will discuss our outlook for key commodities, but given the industry, now appears to be in an oversupply situation"
6768,We do not see near-term relief on commodity prices which will pressure our pricing in the marketplace
6769,"Second, we incurred higher operating expenses primarily for bio-security measures in our live production system and lower yields in our plant operations"
6770,"We will continue to make investments throughout our business, including additional investments in bio-security to protect our business from an avian influenza outbreak"
6771,"Third, as we have addressed in the past, competing proteins continue to pressure our business in addition to increased competitive pressure"
6772,"We experienced this across all three sales divisions; foodservice, retail and deli"
6773,The team at Jennie-O Turkey Store is taking the appropriate actions to address near-term operating conditions and challenges
6774,We remain very optimistic about the demand for JENNIE-O branded products
6775,We have improved similar turkey commodity cycles before and we always emerge in a stronger position
6776,"We will continue to support the brand, deliver innovative new items and invest in the business"
6777,Refrigerated Foods had another strong quarter
6778,"First quarter operating profit increased 4%, with sales and volume down 3%"
6779,"As previously announced, we completed the divestiture of the Farmer John business on January 3, 2017. Excluding the divesture, adjusted sales were down 1% while adjusted volume was flat"
6780,Refrigerated Foods continues to benefit from growth in both retail and foodservice value-added products
6781,"In foodservice, innovative items such as Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth"
6782,"In our retail business, items such as Applegate bacon and breakfast sausage, Hormel Gatherings party trays, and Hormel Natural Choice meats delivered very nice growth"
6783,International operating profits increased 5% while sales decreased 2%
6784,Our fresh pork exports during the quarter were very strong
6785,"We did experience a temporary slowdown in our branded export business due to changes in import regulations in certain countries, which have since been resolved"
6786,Our SKIPPY business in China performed well while our meat business in China continues to experience high pork raw material prices
6787,Specialty Foods operating profit was flat while sales declined 19% and volume declined 30%
6788,"Excluding the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, adjusted sales were up 10% while adjusted volume was up 12%"
6789,"CytoSport posted growth this quarter, driven by our success in the food, drug, mass, and convenience channels in addition to growth in CytoSport powders"
6790,Innovative new items such as Muscle Milk bars and Muscle Milk yogurt smoothies continued to perform well
6791,We saw strong sales growth once again in Grocery Products
6792,Sales were up 7% with volume up 4%
6793,Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 2%
6794,"The addition of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, and SKIPPY all contributed to sales and volume growth"
6795,"We completed the integration of the Justin's business during the quarter, and the business is on track to meet our valuation expectations"
6796,Segment profit for Grocery Products was up 1%
6797,"As we look to the remainder of 2017, the balanced model we have intentionally built in our business will allow us to overcome the challenges at Jennie-O Turkey Store"
6798,We expect Refrigerated Foods results to be better than we projected for the remaining three quarters
6799,"We see continued growth in many of our brands across both retail and foodservice, such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel BACON 1 fully-cooked bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats"
6800,"Grocery Products will continue to build momentum, especially in the back half of the year"
6801,"We continue to see sales growth aided by product lines such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Justin's specialty nut butters, and our Mexican Foods portfolio"
6802,Specialty Foods is expected to perform slightly better than projected for the full year
6803,The team has done an excellent job offsetting the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture
6804,"And as a reminder, we will lap the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture in May"
6805,International will perform as planned for the full year
6806,"We anticipate strong sales for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, and CytoSport protein products in the International segment for the year"
6807,"We expect the Jiaxing plant to begin producing products in the third quarter, enabling us to produce SPAM in China for the first time"
6808,"We also expect relief in China pork prices in the second half of the fiscal year, which will improve the operating environment for our China meat business"
6809,"We continue to see positive demand trends for JENNIE-O branded products, but market conditions are expected to cause full-year sales to be flat to last year"
6810,"Percentage declines in earnings for the second quarter will likely be similar to the first quarter, while decreases in the back half of the fiscal year are expected to be in the mid-single digits"
6811,"While it is early in the year, our assessment of the impact of turkey prices at seven-year lows creates challenges for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the total company's full-year outlook, despite expected growth in other segments"
6812,"As such, we are adjusting our full-year guidance to $1.65 to $1.71 per share"
6813,We are confident in the balance we have purposely built into our business and expect strong performance from our other segments to overcome the market headwinds at Jennie-O Turkey Store
6814,"At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017."
6815,"Morning, Farha"
6816,"Farha, Jim Snee here"
6817,"We do already purchase some meat on the outside, and we do have flexibility at times"
6818,But our production cycle is a relatively long production cycle
6819,So the flexibility doesn't really allow you to capitalize on all of that opportunity
6820,"But certainly, our team is looking at that and watching those market dynamics and taking advantage of it as they can"
6821,"Sure, Farha"
6822,We're very active on the M&A front
6823,"And like most quarters, we feel good about the pipeline we have"
6824,"For us, the biggest issue continues to be getting it across the finish line"
6825,That's always the most difficult part
6826,"But as we think about what we are focused on, the need to become more global, businesses or items that afford us the opportunity to become more healthy, holistic, on-the-go, multicultural are all things that are squarely in our wheelhouse"
6827,"And then we also, of course, are looking for those right opportunities that will add scale or support existing businesses with the idea that we want businesses that are margin accretive, that are one or two in the categories where they compete, and we want to make sure that we're bringing more than just a check that we really can add value to the business"
6828,But I think the important thing to understand is that Fred and his team are very active
6829,"The pipeline is full, and we'll continue to work hard in that area"
6830,"So, Adam, as we put together our new guidance, on the JOTS side of the business, we do expect in Q2 to see similar decreases that we saw in the first quarter, and of course in half two, we're calling for mid-single digit declines for JOTS"
6831,"We don't feel like we're being overly optimistic there, we are taking a realistic look at the business"
6832,"We do expect stronger performance in Refrigerated Foods have very strong value-added sales, we expect that to continue"
6833,"Specialty Foods group, the business and CytoSport which, of course, includes Muscle Milk, continues to perform well"
6834,So we are expecting stronger performance throughout the year
6835,"And then, Grocery Products have seen a lot of good sales momentum, we expect that to continue"
6836,"International, same thing"
6837,"So, we are expecting that those two business units will meet expectations"
6838,"And then as we said, when we roll that all up, it's really – what we tout is our balanced business model that will offset some of those challenging market conditions for JOTS"
6839,"Adam, we did – that your number is right and for us what it is the seasonality in the business"
6840,"And we learned through the rollout – our innovative SKIPPY PB bites items, that once you get past Halloween, there are some seasonality, downturn in the confectionary business"
6841,"So, it wasn't totally unexpected"
6842,But we are on track for the $100 million and the $0.01 EPS accretion this year
6843,So feel really good
6844,"I think at its core, the volume for Justin's year-over-year was up 20%"
6845,So the business is doing quite well
6846,"Good morning, Jeremy"
6847,I don't know if we've ever said that ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge
6848,They obviously have a very strong position
6849,Our position has been that we've seen growth in ground turkey because it continues to be on trend for consumers
6850,And we expect over time that we are going to see growth in the share
6851,We're going to see growth in the category
6852,"Obviously, in any given quarter or any given year you run the risk of the supply cycle, and I think that's what's happened here"
6853,"Obviously, from a pricing perspective, we've seen some discounts"
6854,The one thing that I would point out is that our tray pack volume was still very strong for the quarter
6855,The tray pack volume was up 15%
6856,And so that tells us that the product is on trend with consumers
6857,"But ground beef is certainly going to be a challenge for us as we continue, but we feel like we've got the right product connecting with the right consumers"
6858,"As we looked at the rollup, Jeremy, we really feel like we've done a deep assessment of the business, and this is a realistic outlook for the business"
6859,"We've got some good strong sales growth even in the first quarter in retail, foodservice, deli"
6860,"But the fact is there is competition out there, and we understand that"
6861,We understand the market dynamics
6862,"And so we feel like this guidance is a very realistic look, not only at JOTS, but all of the business segments"
6863,"That's a hard one, Jeremy"
6864,"And we've talked about that a lot in terms of when we've been asked the question about what does it mean to you, one of the things we have responded with is tell us when"
6865,"And so once we know when this is all going to happen, we'll be able to give you a better answer"
6866,And I think labor certainly is one of the variables that comes into the mix
6867,"From our perspective, clearly, we've got a great long-term workforce in many of our facilities, so we're well positioned"
6868,And so we will be watching the timing of these plants coming online very closely and trying to better understand what that means
6869,"Sure, Heather"
6870,"From our perspective, as Jim Sheehan described earlier, we did see a spike in belly prices, and we took appropriate pricing action"
6871,"It's going to take a little while to work through the system, but we feel really good about our ability to continue to take pricing in that category"
6872,"We've also seen some competitive pricing action in that category as well, which bodes well, we believe, for our future, especially in bacon"
6873,"In Refrigerated Foods also, let's not forget about our strong foodservice business"
6874,"They had another great quarter in the first quarter, and there's no signs of that business slowing down"
6875,So we feel really good about that
6876,"And so the second quarter should be a good quarter for Refrigerated Foods, and that's what's leading us to say we do expect it to be a stronger performance for the full year"
6877,"Heather, I would say it's pretty consistent across retail, foodservice, and deli"
6878,"Good morning, Ken"
6879,"First thing, obviously, is we're looking out the balance of the year driven by JOTS"
6880,"As we get throughout the year, we'll be able to take a closer look at that, but it is early for us to be looking out into 2018 and 2019."
6881,"Okay, thanks for the clarification, Ken"
6882,I don't think that it structurally changes our business going forward
6883,We're obviously in a market cycle
6884,That cycle will correct
6885,"And when we think about JOTS in particular, from our perspective, we know that there's history here"
6886,History has been on our side
6887,"We've seen this in 2003 and in the 2008, 2009 timeframe"
6888,"In each case, we've emerged stronger"
6889,We know that it's important for us to stay disciplined
6890,"And JOTS, as you know, it's a key part of our balanced model and a key part of our business"
6891,"So in terms of structural change, we don't see it, we just have to get through this cycle and we will"
6892,"Sure, Akshay"
6893,Jim Snee
6894,"So the first part around competition and competitive pressure, I mean, we are seeing it in the markets, or in the meats, as you say, and we are also seeing it from competitors"
6895,We're not the only company that was coming back out of AI looking to regain distribution and regain business
6896,So there is an element of market pressure and competitive set pressure
6897,So we are seeing that on both sides
6898,"And then when we think about the next piece when you talk about expenses, Jim Sheehan referenced some of the bird performance on the live production side and we know that those are cycles and our team, again, coming out of AI is already working on addressing that in the live production side of the business"
6899,So competition does have both parts
6900,The expenses with bird performance
6901,"The other thing that we mentioned, which is going to be a very good thing for us over the long-term is our venture into raised without antibiotics"
6902,"And right now, obviously, we're making investments in that business"
6903,We know that it's the right thing to do
6904,"And that includes feed, supply chain densities"
6905,There's a lot of things too that go into that
6906,"And then the last thing, Akshay, and I want to make this part just clear on your opening comment"
6907,We are not projecting $100 million decline year-on-year for Jennie-O Turkey Store
6908,"We would expect it to be less than that, more – maybe half of that"
6909,"Akshay, we saw that release earlier this week as well"
6910,"Obviously, chicken has been in that space for a long time"
6911,And so it's too early to tell
6912,"We haven't seen the product, haven't really heard what the consumers think, haven't heard what retailers think"
6913,So it's really too early to tell on that specific product line
6914,But clearly we'll be watching it closely
6915,"Thanks, Akshay"
6916,Really we've got stronger performance for the balance of the year in both Refrigerated and Specialty Foods
6917,"On the Refrigerated side, the big driver there is going to be continued strong value-added sales both on the retail side of the business and continued strong performance from our foodservice team"
6918,"And then on the Specialty Foods side, like we said, the CytoSport business continues to do well gaining distribution, but also some great, new innovative items that are really starting to take hold in the marketplace"
6919,"So between those two things, that's really what's going to offset some of the difficult market conditions for JOTS"
6920,"Yes, Sean"
6921,Jim Snee
6922,That's a fair statement
6923,"Really in terms of expenses, obviously, advertising was up on the quarter"
6924,"There, as you would expect, were expenses associated with the Justin's integration that are one-time expenses"
6925,So certainly advertising will play a benefit for the rest of the year
6926,"We won't have the ongoing integration charges, but the bigger driver in all of this is really the sales momentum for Grocery Products"
6927,And so SKIPPY continues to do really well
6928,Our MegaMex portfolio of products is doing well
6929,And then we do see some favorable market conditions that will help them out and then again the full year benefit of Justin's
6930,So that's really what's driving our outlook for Grocery Products
6931,"I think, Sean, we've talked a lot about the continued growth, the migration up the value ladder, if you will, in our Refrigerated Foods segment, and it occurs not just in packaged items"
6932,"We're doing it across the entire Refrigerated Foods organization, in fresh pork, in meat products"
6933,It's happening everywhere
6934,"And so we'll continue to work on that, and we've been very successful"
6935,"The other part to really consider is the, once again, strong growth of our foodservice business"
6936,That's a business that continue to deliver quite well for our organization
6937,We don't expect that to slow down
6938,And then a lot of the innovation work that we are doing in on-the-go with our party trays and some of our other items that we've developed
6939,"So is it a structural difference? It certainly is a structural shift, and we will continue to be working on that so that we do eliminate volatility over the long-term"
6940,Sure
6941,"Thanks, Rob"
6942,"So to your first question, the answer is yes"
6943,"We are committed to that long-term margin guidance, and clearly the impact of Jennie-O on just this one quarter moved us back a little bit"
6944,But we do believe that this business is going to rebound and will emerge stronger and it's going to be a key part of that journey in the margin improvement
6945,So the answer is yes
6946,We are committed to that
6947,"And to your second question, certainly there are elements of both, right? I think we are still probably gaining back some distribution, but you're gaining back distribution because there's consumer demand"
6948,"And so again, the underlying fundamental there is we feel really good about the business, it's connecting with consumers and it's on trend, and we expect to continue to do that"
6949,"Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay, thank you"
6950,"Sure, Rupesh"
6951,"Good morning, Jim Snee"
6952,"Yeah, just following up on the earlier question around Justin's, the $13 million in the first quarter does account for some seasonality in the business in the whole confectionary space"
6953,But we do want to point out that the volume is up 20% year over year
6954,And so we do believe that we're on track for $100 million for the full year and still remain very positive about that acquisition and that business going forward
6955,"And as you get to the Applegate business, our team there continues to work through the rebound of the supply situation, both on the pork side, and then that was compounded with turkey supply shortages through AI"
6956,"And as you think of that business in specific parts of the store, the walled deli space is extremely competitive"
6957,"The team's making progress there, but that's been a battle"
6958,Really a lot of continued success in the meat case and the freezer
6959,"Hot dogs, dinner sausage, the nuggets, the chicken breakfast sausage, those items are doing well"
6960,And we're working now on developing business in the foodservice channel as well
6961,So we think that that business is very healthy and going to continue to do well
6962,Sure
6963,"Eric, good morning, Jim Snee"
6964,Thanks for those questions
6965,I'll try to break those down here
6966,So the first one around avocados – and you are correct
6967,We have taken pricing increases on Wholly Guacamole
6968,"And those prices have been in the marketplace a little while now, but consumer demand remains strong for the products"
6969,"In terms of the avocado market, there are a couple of things"
6970,"Prices are historically high, but they are down from some of their October peaks"
6971,The other thing to understand is that there is adequate supply
6972,"And so we have a number of – or a lot of the supply that comes out of Mexico, but we have other sources for supply as well"
6973,So there's adequate supply in that space
6974,And we again feel really good about the business going forward
6975,"From a Grocery Products perspective, our guidance is consistent with what we laid out in the fourth quarter call"
6976,"And so the business is very healthy, a lot of sales momentum"
6977,"And you're right, once you get through some of these one-time expenses, we'll be able to deliver the guidance we laid out"
6978,"And yeah, there is a mix shift (53:56), a mix shift as we think about the Justin's and SKIPPY and all of those product lines that really continue to build a nice broad base in the Grocery Products portfolio"
6979,So we feel really good about what Grocery Products is doing and where they're headed
6980,"Hi, Mario"
6981,I think we're on track for the 5% organic growth number
6982,"As you go around all of the different business segments, Refrigerated Foods, the strong value-added sales will continue to deliver there"
6983,JOTS will be slightly lower
6984,"We are going to see some volume growth, but obviously we understand the market conditions"
6985,Specialty Foods will continue to perform well
6986,"And then International, Grocery Products are all on track for what we said they were going to do"
6987,"So we do believe, Mario, that we're going to be able to deliver that 5% organic number"
6988,"I mean, I think, we've said our stronger performance will come from Refrigerated and Specialty, but there's some really nice sales momentum in Grocery Products, and we don't expect that to slow down"
6989,"Thanks, Mario"
6990,"Specialty Foods, you've got to remember that that's still a mix of CytoSport, HHL and our Specialty Products group"
6991,"And so when we talk about that business, we are talking across all those different categories that are performing well"
6992,"So I think we expect that business to continue to be strong, and even within that segment there's a bit of a balance that goes on at any given time"
6993,We've seen some nice growth with CytoSport in some more traditional channels
6994,"Remember, the C-store business, which is a big part of the CytoSport business, isn't measured"
6995,And the team's done a great job not only gaining distribution but creating innovative new items to meet the needs of that channel
6996,So it's all of those things that are really setting it up for a strong 2017.
6997,"Heather, just a reminder, fresh pork exports are – they are a decent-sized part of the International business"
6998,"They're not, I would say, a huge part of the overall company"
6999,"And on any given year, obviously, we've had strength and then we've had some challenges with pricing pressure with products coming out of the European markets the last several years"
7000,But it does look like the markets are setting up for a strong full year
7001,"Certainly, you've got the China conditions, but I think we've also all read what's happened, or what is happening in South Korea, which is a strong export market for us"
7002,So I mean we do feel like it'll continue to be strong throughout the year
7003,"No, we're less than that, Heather"
7004,Great
7005,"Well, thank you all very much"
7006,"While unfavorable market conditions in the turkey industry challenged our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, the balance we have intentionally built into all of our businesses allowed us to deliver earnings growth this quarter"
7007,"Our team has a track record of delivering results, and we clearly understand what needs to be done this year to deliver the guidance range we provided"
7008,"On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today"
7009,"Good morning, everyone"
7010,Let me start with the headlines for the quarter
7011,"Sales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year"
7012,"We delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook"
7013,"And finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan"
7014,"Now let's take a look at the details, starting with sales"
7015,"Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales"
7016,Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes
7017,"On profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year"
7018,"Operating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points"
7019,"While margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall"
7020,"Commodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs"
7021,Our teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings
7022,Second quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million
7023,Our original target was for savings of at least $400 million
7024,"Given the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending"
7025,"On the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year"
7026,"Lower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate"
7027,Now let's take a look at cash flow
7028,"Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations"
7029,"Cash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year"
7030,"Second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days"
7031,"We're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year"
7032,"We also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range"
7033,"On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million"
7034,We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion
7035,"Looking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices"
7036,Organic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere
7037,"Personal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points"
7038,"The improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs"
7039,"In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America"
7040,"Overall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points"
7041,The results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs
7042,"In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies"
7043,"K-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points"
7044,The comparison included benefits from cost savings
7045,"So in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity"
7046,"Nonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways"
7047,I'll now turn the call back over to Tom
7048,"Yeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target"
7049,"And what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere"
7050,"When you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products"
7051,"And year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well"
7052,I continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward
7053,"So good performance there, and I think more opportunity there"
7054,Sure
7055,"On the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year"
7056,We're on track with that
7057,"And in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize"
7058,"And the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year"
7059,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone"
7060,"As Bill mentioned, our associates are executing at a high level as we continue to deliver on the key strategic levers of our three-year plan: delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars, and managing overall expenses"
7061,"This morning, I'd like to discuss our segment results with a focus on U.S"
7062,Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice Operations
7063,I will also highlight some of the key strategic initiatives of our U.S
7064,business that are helping us to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace
7065,Starting with our quarterly results for U.S
7066,"Foodservice Operations, sales grew 2.2% and gross profit had growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 2.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7%"
7067,"Overall, our U.S"
7068,Foodservice segment had a strong quarter
7069,"We experienced strong growth in our local business as we accelerated case growth to 3.5%, which was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business, resulting in 1.8% total case growth"
7070,"Importantly, as we strive to deliver disciplined, profitable growth as a part of our three-year plan, our continued focus on providing value to our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with improved e-commerce capabilities, has enabled our growth with these customers for the 12th quarter in a row"
7071,Looking at gross profit growth for U.S
7072,"Foodservice Operations, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 35 basis points as we continue to manage the deflationary environment well"
7073,"As you all know, the industry has been in a deflationary environment for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and that trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation"
7074,"Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have begun to rise"
7075,"Based on those changes, we are anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter"
7076,Our strategy around accelerating growth with local customers is working
7077,"Over the last several quarters, we've improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology, and targeted resources"
7078,"And as a result, our marketing associates are spending more time selling and focusing on delivering benefits to our customers versus spending time on non-value-added activities"
7079,"In addition, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts"
7080,"As an example, one of the insights we've received from customers was around providing healthier product options"
7081,"In response, we created a good-to-grow promotion during the third quarter that highlighted the large variety of fresh and healthy produce options available to our customers"
7082,"Furthermore, we brought innovative products to market through our Cutting Edge Solutions program"
7083,"This program introduces new product ideas to customers, which can help them reduce labor costs and/or improve the quality of their menu offering"
7084,These are just a few of the programs that have translated into improving loyalty scores for Sysco this past year
7085,We are committed to delivering value to our customers while also providing a more consistent experience of doing business with us
7086,From a cost perspective within U.S
7087,"Foodservice Operations, our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 2.3% on an adjusted basis for the quarter"
7088,"Broadline, cost per case improved by approximately $0.02 compared to the prior year"
7089,"And on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case improved by $0.01, ahead of our three-year plan objective"
7090,"In our supply chain area, we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements which are driving efficiencies"
7091,One example is our slotting initiative that's helping our warehouses to build pallets faster and more accurately
7092,"In the area of delivery, we are seeing progress in improved routing and delivery metrics through the leverage of enhanced technology"
7093,"While there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are focused on continuing this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year"
7094,"Additionally, we are continuing to thoughtfully manage our administrative expenses through a more consistent approach that is improving our overall efficiency while maintaining service level to our customers"
7095,Looking at the overall performance for U.S
7096,"Foodservice Operations, I'm very pleased with our level of execution, which enables us to deliver solid operating income growth and improved operating margins by 34 basis points"
7097,"Moving to International Foodservice Operations, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $6.6 million, both driven largely by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group"
7098,"During the quarter, Brakes performed well amidst a challenging environment in the U.K"
7099,and is continuing to make progress in their supply chain transformational efforts
7100,"Growth in France remains steady, and Sweden continues to produce favorable results"
7101,"Additionally, we continue to see opportunities for growth across our European business"
7102,"Lastly, although we are in the early days of integrating our Ireland businesses, things are progressing well, and we expect to achieve modest benefits from that integration"
7103,"Looking to Canada, we are pleased with our performance despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline"
7104,Our Canadian business overall is leveraging the many learnings and successes of our U.S
7105,-focused initiatives and is now implementing many of them
7106,"For example, we've introduced the category management and revenue management processes, and we are offering multi-channel ordering via online and telephony, as we provide our customers the ability to choose how they order from Sysco"
7107,"These initiatives are a few examples of how we are enhancing our customers' experience, as we support the growth of our local business"
7108,"In addition, we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity"
7109,"As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver improving positive performance"
7110,"Turning to Latin America, we are excited about new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama"
7111,"Specifically in Costa Rica, we have opened 180,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility with a test kitchen and training facilities"
7112,"This new space will enable new products and full product lines to be available to our customers, and we're excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver"
7113,"In summary, our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution, and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three-year plan"
7114,"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details"
7115,"Hey, good morning, Kelly"
7116,Thanks for the question
7117,"So, let's start with – I think we feel really good about the work we've continued to do in this segment"
7118,"And if you think about where we said we'd be on our three-year plan, we're right where we've said we would be, which is around 2.5% local case growth"
7119,"So, obviously, good quarter this quarter"
7120,"And what I would say is I think over the three-year time, our goal was to continue to gain share in this space, and I feel like we continue to make progress there"
7121,But I think what I'd attribute it to is continued just execution of our strategy
7122,"If you think about these customers, we've been very focused on them"
7123,I think our value proposition is resonating with them
7124,"And I think based on that, we're seeing more and more customers support Sysco and partner with us"
7125,"If you think about new business growth, we're also seeing some new business growth in this space"
7126,"But overall, I would say it's really just more consistent continuation of the work we've been doing, and I think we're seeing the recognition of that effort with these customers"
7127,"Okay, I'll start and then I'll toss it to Joel for some of the further discussion around the deflation and inflation"
7128,"So, I think gross margin percentage, yes, it probably slowed a little bit versus where we've been, but I think still very strong"
7129,And I think you are starting to see a little bit of impact of that starting to move from deflation to inflation that could be impacting that
7130,"But just as a reminder, the areas we continue to talk about regarding gross margin improvement are the category management effort we've had for a few years now, continued improvement in Sysco Brands"
7131,"So, you saw again additional growth in Sysco Brand with our local customers"
7132,"Obviously, that shift of mix to higher local case growth versus corporate multi-unit is going to impact that as well"
7133,"And then, obviously, now revenue management is kind of part of the way we operate day in and day out"
7134,"So, I think those are all key drivers, what continues even as we start to see a little bit of slowing of the deflationary environment start to happen"
7135,Why don't I toss it to Joel? He can talk a little bit about some of the categories that are starting to shift a bit
7136,You heard me talk a little bit about it and then maybe just idea of gross margin dollars versus just gross margin percent
7137,"Good morning, Karen"
7138,"So, I assume when you say capacity, you're just talking about overall warehouse capacity?"
7139,"And so, I would say we are fine in that regard"
7140,"You heard me talk kind of over the quarters about different efforts we're talking where we may have some capacity constraints to get more capacity out of our facilities and more throughput, and a lot of those initiatives in our supply chain area have been working very well"
7141,"So, we're going to continue to focus on those where we have challenges"
7142,But we think we feel very comfortable at this point about our ability to not only handle our existing customers but continue to grow this business within our current footprint
7143,"Well, you heard me talk over the first couple quarters about some of the challenges we've had in the SYGMA business"
7144,"And some of that had to do with some of the operational aspects of the business specific to certain customers, and also the deflationary environment we've seen"
7145,"So, I think as you start to see some of that deflation slowing as we talk, there's some benefit we're seeing there"
7146,And we continue to focus on improving our operational effectiveness
7147,"I'd say that those are probably the two biggest drivers of the kind of shift in our performance, although I would say while we feel better about the quarter, we still feel like we have a lot of opportunity in the SYGMA side of the business"
7148,This is Tom
7149,"Yeah, I'd say, Marisa, that we're – again, we're talking about mild numbers at this point, and as Joel said earlier, this industry historically, I think, operates pretty well at these kind of lower inflation levels"
7150,"So, we're not seeing anything that would concern us right now about our ability to pass along those prices"
7151,"I mean, in the category like produce, when you get some of the weather issues they had in California earlier this year, you'll get some spikes in certain areas that have to be kind of managed closely"
7152,"But generally speaking, we feel fine about how it's affecting the business right now"
7153,"Chris, I think the only thing I'd really add was more – and some of that caution might have also been around the corporate multi-unit because at the time, we had been slowing in that area"
7154,We obviously rely heavily on how each of those concepts themselves perform
7155,"And so, I think that's always something that we are thoughtful about as we go into any quarter"
7156,"So, I don't think there's much else to add to what Bill said"
7157,"I think we feel really good about where we're at, and I feel like we've got good momentum which is important going forward"
7158,"Hey, John, good morning"
7159,"So, look, I think – let me say a couple things"
7160,"One, I'd say, we definitely feel like we are improving our level of penetration with our customers, which is selling more to our existing customers"
7161,"To give you a number on what percentage, I think that's probably a bit of a stretch and"
7162,But I think we feel like we are continuing to further penetrate and gain our share of wallet with those customers
7163,And we obviously are growing new customers and adding customers to the portfolio as well
7164,"So, I think we have a good balance of both of those working, and I think we feel really comfortable with where that's at"
7165,"As far as where that's coming from, it comes from a lot of different places"
7166,"It's hard to, again, peg, is it just in the specialty area? I think we continue to perform well in the specialty areas"
7167,But I also would say that the broadline business is really doing very well
7168,And a lot of what you see is the sheer size of our broadline business especially in the U.S
7169,"That's where a lot of the growth is going to come from, is from more within our existing customers and certainly picking up some new business from other broadline competitors"
7170,"Yeah, I don't think I have really that much to add"
7171,I think Bill answered that pretty well
7172,"The only thing I'd go back to, we've said earlier around the local, is we feel like we're very focused on improving our share wallet with our existing customers, and we're seeing good momentum there"
7173,"And then, sure, we're always looking at new business opportunities in that space"
7174,But I would say it's not anything unique or different this quarter than what we've been doing
7175,"I think we just feel like we've got good momentum, and we're continuing to execute our plan accordingly"
7176,Edward J
7177,Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
7178,"And then, just one quick follow-up"
7179,"And we're kind of beating a dead horse a little bit here, but it's probably worth it"
7180,"As you think about inflation and deflation and your goal to drive gross profit dollar growth, a couple hundred basis points faster than SG&A, you would rather have an inflationary backdrop than a deflationary backdrop in order to achieve that, number one"
7181,"And then, number two, sounds like you'd encourage us to really think more about, as we analyze you as a company, more about how you're achieving that gap and how you're growing gross profit dollars over really what your gross margin is doing in any given quarter"
7182,"I think the only thing I'd add – this is Tom – is that the minimum wage changes you might see around that Bill referenced that certainly impacted some of our customers, don't really impact us much because we're generally well above the minimum wage with all of our employees"
7183,"I think the only thing I'd add is just keep in mind, I mean, we are still in a deflationary point with meat"
7184,"And again, a couple of the other categories"
7185,"Again, we talk about dairy, produce, some of those, to Joel's point earlier, tend to be more volatile in general"
7186,"So, again, I still think we're certainly in a decent place there"
7187,"And again, certainly a modest inflation level is something we feel good about in this industry"
7188,"Yeah, just keep in mind, I think everyone knows this because you're probably ahead of me on your modeling, but Brakes is a higher gross profit, higher expense business"
7189,"So, when you get into a quarter where you have this seasonality, which is even more pronounced than our seasonality, that's going to accentuate that even more"
7190,But that's really why we break it out the way we do
7191,"We're actually quite pleased with how we manage the expenses from the core business, if you will, to Brakes to the corporate office"
7192,"So, I would say right now, we're feeling good about the expenses"
7193,"We need to keep growing the gross profit, keep that spread, to Joel's point"
7194,But that is totally consistent with what we talk about
7195,"We talk about that and the customer mix, and we talk about profitable"
7196,"In this business, what we mean with profitable is to keep that spread there"
7197,"So, overall, we feel fine on the expenses"
7198,This is Tom
7199,"You might have to help a little bit with – so, you talk about gross profit per case which we don't really talk about"
7200,Are you talking about gross margin and the slowing of the gross margin percent improvement?
7201,I don't really see anything unique or different from what we've been talking about
7202,I think it's obviously the mix of our business continues to drive some of the change
7203,"That's certainly, as we talked about, on the gross margin percentage also lapping"
7204,We're year-over-year now lapping growth rate upon growth rate from a gross margin percentage perspective
7205,But I guess the last thing I'd say is we feel very good about our 4% gross profit growth in the U.S
7206,", and I think relative to the overall case growth that we're seeing, which was slightly below 2% for that same gross profit growth"
7207,"So, I think we feel very good about where we're at"
7208,"Joel, if you have anything to add (01:02:13)"
7209,"So, I'd say, just back on the market share"
7210,"So, we obviously are very focused on continuing to grow our share across the business"
7211,"I think, as you know, there are lots of competitors out there"
7212,"So, to isolate in one area or another is really hard to do, given we compete with so many different types of folks, literally market by market"
7213,"So, I would just say that we continue to be focused on delivering the right value proposition for those customers, which includes all the things that I've been talking about"
7214,"So, I won't reiterate all of those"
7215,"One, in particular, that you did ask about was where we're at on the technology rollout, and we continue to feel really positive about that"
7216,We're now seeing across our local customers around 25% of those customers ordering via our online applications
7217,"So, we feel really good about the progress we're making, and we continue to feel like that's going to be an area that we'll continue to see growth"
7218,"But we also – I want to remind everyone that our approach and our strategy around this is to do this in a way that supports whatever our customers are looking for, meaning giving them choice"
7219,Whether that's through online or that's through the marketing associate or through some other way of ordering with us
7220,But we feel great about the progress we continue to make and think it's a combination of all those things that are helping us continue to gain momentum
7221,"I guess, let me start with – we don't communicate the actual numbers on our corporately managed growth"
7222,"But you know roughly from our prior conversations, we're around 50/50 on our local versus CMU business"
7223,"And so, we talked about our local and U.S"
7224,"Broadline being up 3.5%, and our total of 1.8%"
7225,"So, you can surmise from there"
7226,"I missed kind of the second part of that, I think it had to do with the inflation-deflation"
7227,"So, I don't think – I mean, we've talked about, it remains highly competitive out there"
7228,I don't think that the inflation or deflationary environment necessarily affects or changes that competitive nature and who we're competing with
7229,We all deal with some of those impacts as an industry
7230,"And obviously, all of us have our way of dealing with those"
7231,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone"
7232,"As you saw on this morning's release, we concluded 2016 with another strong quarter of operating performance, capping off a very successful year"
7233,"The operating environment continued to be challenging in 2016. So in this context, I am pleased to report that we achieved or exceeded each of the financial goals we shared with you at the beginning of the year"
7234,"To recap, we grew organic revenue 3.7%, in line with our goal of approximately 4%"
7235,"We met our goal of expanding core operating margins, which were up 80 basis points compared to 2015. Core constant currency EPS grew 9% versus our initial goal of 6%"
7236,"Keep in mind this includes the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela, which was approximate 2.5 point drag on earnings"
7237,"Excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela, core constant currency EPS grew 12%"
7238,"We generated $7.8 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items"
7239,We substantially exceeded our goal of $7 billion
7240,"Core net ROIC expanded by 190 basis points and now stands at 21.5%, well in excess of our cost of capital"
7241,"And we met our goal of returning $7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our 5-year cumulative shareholder cash returns to $38 billion"
7242,"And reflecting our continuing commitment to providing attractive cash returns to our owners, I'm also pleased to announce that we are increasing our annualized dividend per share for the 45th consecutive year beginning with our June 2017 payment, to $3.22 per share, which represents a 3% yield based on yesterday's closing share price"
7243,We had notably good operating performance across our operating segments for the year
7244,"Our two largest divisions, Frito-Lay North America and North America Beverages, each had strong well-balanced performance with volume gains, net price realization and margin expansion, driving high single-digit core constant currency operating profit growth"
7245,"And despite the macro volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our international divisions delivered very solid organic revenue growth, led by high single-digit growth in our developing and emerging markets businesses as a group, with particularly strong performance in Mexico, China and Egypt, which grew organic revenue in the double digits"
7246,Our results reflect our commitment to plan and manage our business in a way that's self-sustaining and balances delivery of attractive short-term financial results with long-term shareholder value creation
7247,"We achieve this by executing a virtuous circle model that combines top-line growth, productivity and significant reinvestment in the business"
7248,Our top-line performance is underpinned by strong market positions in growing categories and an enviable portfolio of leading brands
7249,"And it is fueled by a product innovation engine built on consumer and shopper insights, deep research and development capabilities, and the broad market reach afforded by our advantaged go-to-market systems"
7250,Our top line growth is also supported by strong collaborative customer relationships
7251,Customers value our relationships with them because we deliver growth
7252,"Our brands and products drive basket size and an extremely high velocity off the shelf, and therefore generate significant cash flow for our retail partners"
7253,"Our customers value our robust innovation, the in-store labor benefits of DSD [Direct Store Delivery], and our sophisticated consumer and shopper insights"
7254,"The strength of our customer relationships was evident in the most recent Kantar Retail PoweRanking in the United States, where we achieved the top spot as the number one best-in-class manufacturer, and we earned top marks in the individual categories of most important brands, use of digital platforms, insights and category management, growth and profitability, supply chain management, clear company strategy, and sales force and customer teams"
7255,"Beyond this impressive recognition, our capabilities and diligent execution enabled us once again to be the largest driver of growth for our food and beverage retail partners in the United States, which is our largest market"
7256,"In fact, while we represent less than 10% of retail food and beverage sales, in 2016 we drove 18% of the total retail sales growth of food and beverage"
7257,This compares to a net decline in sales for all other $5 billion-plus manufacturers combined
7258,Our success is also supported by an aggressive and relentless drive for productivity that contributes to current financial performance and provides the funding for investments that will sustain our growth into the future
7259,These substantial investments have largely been directed at capabilities that fuel top line growth
7260,"So to strengthen our brands, we've increased our advertising and marketing as a percent of sales by 145 basis points over the past five years and increased it by 40 basis points in just this past year alone"
7261,"At the same time, we have directed a higher percentage of our A&M budget from non-working A&M to consumer-facing working A&M to increase returns in our A&M spending"
7262,"And we have strengthened our capabilities in digital marketing, enabling us to execute marketing campaigns that seamlessly weave together social media, traditional media, and point of sale for greater impact"
7263,We've increased our investment in R&D by 45% since 2011 and have spent approximately $3.5 billion on R&D and food quality and safety initiatives cumulatively over the past five years
7264,"In addition, over the past several years, we have amplified our own financial investments in R&D by expanding and strengthening our relationships with key strategic suppliers and academic and research institutions to leverage their capabilities to our benefit"
7265,We've also established a global design center staffed with world-class creative talent
7266,"Increasingly, we are incorporating design beginning in the earliest stages of innovation to take into account the entire purchase-to-consumption cycle, and this is resulting in the creation of not just products, but truly memorable experiences for our consumers"
7267,"Our R&D capability investments have led to the creation of new products in the short term and to the development of new platforms, ingredients, and packaging with longer-term potential for breakthrough benefits, such as sugar, calorie, fat and sodium reductions, and more sustainable packaging alternatives"
7268,"Under this robust innovation agenda, net revenue from new products, which we define as products introduced within the past three years, has averaged more than $5 billion since 2013. And we are pleased to report that in 2016, PepsiCo accounted for over 17% of innovation sales at retail, as measured by IRI in the United States, more innovation than from the next four innovation contributors combined"
7269,And it has also advanced our portfolio transformation
7270,"For example, we launched a number of new low and reduced calorie drinks in 2016, such as new recipes of Mirinda and 7UP with 30% less sugar, which is rolling out in over 80 international markets"
7271,"Meanwhile, we saw great momentum across our nutritious and functional beverages"
7272,"Naked Juice is on its way to being our next $1 billion brand, while Tropicana launched Tropicana Essentials Probiotics, making it the first brand to bring probiotics to the mainstream juice consumer"
7273,"Gatorade Frost exceeded $1 billion in measured retail sales, pushing Gatorade over a high watermark of $5 billion in measured retail sales"
7274,And our Russia team launched a new J7 apple juice that delivers all the fiber of a single apple in every glass
7275,"At the same time, we grew our portfolio of healthier snacks with Quaker Breakfast Flats, a snack we plan to roll out in more than a dozen countries over the next two years"
7276,We are building on the success of Baked Lay's by broadening our lineup of baked products
7277,"And we're expanding Sabra, a brand that generates roughly $800 million in estimated annual retail sales"
7278,"We are expanding it beyond hummus into a range of products, from guacamole and salsa to Greek yogurt dips and spreads"
7279,"Simply put, when it comes to transforming our portfolio, we are making considerable progress"
7280,"In fact, some people are surprised to learn that our beloved Pepsi-Cola trademark accounted for 12% of net revenue in 2016. What we refer to as everyday nutrition products account for approximately 25% of our portfolio by net revenue"
7281,"These are products that include positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea"
7282,And what we refer to as guilt-free products comprises about 45% of net revenue
7283,This broader definition includes the everyday nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages with fewer than 70 calories per 12 ounce and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat
7284,We've also made disciplined investments in our physical infrastructure
7285,"Over the past five years we've invested approximately $14 billion in property, plant, and equipment to support the growth of our business, maintain a safe work environment, use less energy and water, and achieve the highest levels of quality and safety in our products"
7286,"We also recognize that we're living in an era where all of our stakeholders, from shareholders like you to our consumers, associates, and partners, are all increasingly expecting corporations like ours not only to make a profit, but to do so in a way that's responsive to the needs of the local communities where we operate"
7287,"And that's exactly what we've been doing, making investments to lift up farmers and workers, small businesses, families and children, from Mexico, where Quaker launched a pin oat malnutrition prevention trial with over 1,000 low-income children; to Pakistan, where we tripled the number of girls benefiting from our I am PepsiCo mentoring and social program; and forging strong ties with local communities"
7288,Forging strong ties with local communities isn't just the right thing to do
7289,"It's also the right thing to do for our business, reinforcing the bonds that will sustain our success over the long-term"
7290,"And finally, we are investing in our most valuable asset of all, our people by: expanding paid family leave; adopting flexible work arrangements; enhancing our learning and development programs; and many other actions"
7291,We are building a workplace that is diverse and inclusive and that will continue to attract the top talent in industry in all levels of the organization
7292,"In summary, we've established solid momentum in our business, with strong financial performance generated through a healthy balance of top-line performance and productivity"
7293,"And we have made, and will continue to make, investments in capability and infrastructure that we believe will strengthen the competitiveness of our business and lengthen the duration of our financial returns"
7294,Our results for 2016 reflect the effectiveness of this approach and gives us confidence in our ability to continue to perform well going forward
7295,"With that, I'll turn the call over to Hugh to cover the 2017 outlook"
7296,"Good morning, Bryan"
7297,"Hugh, go ahead"
7298,"Well, thank you"
7299,I'm going to let Hugh answer this
7300,"I'll just tell you one thing, Ali"
7301,"As I mentioned in my script, investments in A&M, R&D, those we're not backing off of"
7302,We've increased investment in A&M
7303,"We've increased investment in R&D and we'll keep investing money in areas that drive the top-line growth of the company, but, Hugh, why don't you talk about the SG&A productivity plan and the share repurchase guidance?"
7304,"And basically what we're saying is what is under our control, we intend to execute very well"
7305,"And then, whatever happens in the macro environment, we'll try to manage through it as best we can"
7306,"Good morning, Bonnie"
7307,"Hugh, go ahead"
7308,This is all walking through the P&L and balance sheet
7309,"On DSD, DSD is the strength of our company"
7310,"Given the nature of our categories, which are high velocity, relatively low value density, DSD is critical because they're impulse, and how we merchandise the product really drives the growth of the category"
7311,So we are totally committed to DSD
7312,And we continue to make investments in DSD to modify it as we go along to account for whatever disruption happens in the retail channels
7313,So PepsiCo remains committed to DSD
7314,"Regarding the beverage outlook in North America, we've always tracked liquid refreshment beverage growth as a whole"
7315,"We've expected for the past decade or more that there will be shifts within the category from carbonated soft drinks to non-carbonated soft drinks, and we've managed the portfolio accordingly"
7316,So I think you should focus on LRB [Liquid Refreshment Beverage] as a whole
7317,And our expectation is that the overall LRB category will grow slightly above population growth and around GDP growth
7318,And that's really what our anticipation is for the LRB category growth going forward
7319,"Yes, good morning"
7320,"In the case of share in North America, we track LRB share"
7321,We track savory share
7322,"We track salty share, macro snack share"
7323,We track it every which way
7324,"And as we've always said, we want to make sure we balance share growth and profitability very, very judiciously"
7325,Our goal is never to hit the pricing lever too much in order to gain share
7326,"We want to make sure that we keep the pricing architecture across our portfolio very, very consistent over the quarter and over the year"
7327,"So I wouldn't worry about small perturbations in share in any one quarter, in any one category"
7328,"This is something we monitor very, very carefully"
7329,And I'd say both Frito-Lay North America and our North America Beverage business as a whole are doing well
7330,"Gatorade, in particular, is one of our crown jewels, and the business is performing very, very well"
7331,We have a leadership position in the isotonic category
7332,"And the business is performing exceedingly well in the category, which involves active thirst, which is really what we track"
7333,"So, Hugh, let me turn it over to you to answer the first part of the question"
7334,"Good morning, Robert"
7335,"I think that's way too detailed a question, Vivien"
7336,"I'd just say that over time, across the company, not just Frito-Lay, but across all of PepsiCo, we have actually dialed up our revenue management capabilities"
7337,We've built revenue management centers of excellence across North America
7338,"And we've improved our understanding of household down to a very granular level that allows us to tailor products and packaging for individual households and get the price utilization we need, because we can put the right assortment on the shelves based on the trading area of that particular store and the households that that store targets"
7339,I think that's what drives revenue management
7340,And you're going to see that being deployed across North America
7341,"And hopefully, that'll result in better revenue realization as we go forward"
7342,"Caroline, good morning"
7343,Good to hear you
7344,"The Mountain Dew franchise is alive and energetic, pardon the pun"
7345,"If you include regular Mountain Dew, Diet, all the variants in Kickstart, it's a thriving franchising and perhaps one of the best-performing franchises in the CSD universe"
7346,And we intend to continue to invest behind Mountain Dew
7347,We intend to continue to invest behind Kickstart and the franchise is doing well
7348,"Regarding Diet Pepsi, we had a bit of a hiccup with Diet Pepsi with the rollout of the aspartame-free product, but now with the relaunch of the zero-sugar Pepsi, putting it on the Super Bowl, we're back in business"
7349,It's a great tasting product
7350,It is a great tasting product
7351,"In fact, I'd say it's the best tasting diet in the market"
7352,Try it
7353,And I think our plan is to invest behind the zero-sugar Pepsi rollout and make sure that it is the diet for the Pepsi portfolio
7354,"And on demonetization, across the board for pretty much all of industry and CPG in particular, because it hit the individual retailers significantly, demonetization had a significant impact on our India business in Q4. And there's still some lingering effects"
7355,I'm not sure we are totally out of the woods
7356,"It's a big country, a massive change because it's currency that was about 80% of the circulation out in the country that was taken out of circulation, and the implementation had its share of challenges"
7357,"So our hope was that by the time Q2 rolls by, we would be through the bulk of the demonetization challenges"
7358,And the new currency and the digital currency will be back in circulation and we'll be back to retail activity coming back to normal
7359,We are basic food and beverage
7360,I don't believe political actions impact consumption of our products
7361,"And we're not seeing any deterioration in activity versus our products, and the market growth continues"
7362,Thank you for your questions
7363,"So to summarize, we are pleased with our results for 2016 and that gives us confidence in our performance as we enter 2017. We are committed to continue to manage everything within our control in what we expect will be a volatile and uncertain macro environment in order to deliver attractive results in the short-term, as we continue to position the business for long-term success"
7364,Thank you all for joining us this morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment
7365,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone"
7366,Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives
7367,"While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year and ultimately deliver on our three-year operating income target"
7368,"Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S"
7369,"Foodservice Operations, sales grew 3.9% for the quarter, gross profit grew 3.8%, and gross margins remain flat"
7370,"Adjusting for the hurricanes, gross profit dollar growth would have been approximately 4.3%"
7371,The growth in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the continued focus on category management including positive momentum from Sysco Brand and a balanced approach to pricing with our ongoing revenue management efforts
7372,"For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S"
7373,Broadline business remained strong at 2.8% and has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters
7374,"Adjusting for hurricanes, we believe that local case growth would have been over 3%"
7375,"Our multi-unit customer segment declined, driving overall case growth to a modest 0.3%"
7376,"As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business in a more disciplined, profitable manner with multi-unit customers"
7377,We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multi-unit growth begin to build in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year
7378,"While we do see customers' preference – consumers' preferences in restaurants continuing to include new, unique and customizable options that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity"
7379,"These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multi-unit customers who provide value in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point"
7380,"From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort including a reinvigoration of our portfolio that offers cleaner, fresher images for our branded products"
7381,"These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points versus prior year"
7382,"Regarding our supplier community, there were many examples during the recent storms where our supplier partners were there to support us and our customers who were in need"
7383,And I also want to share our thanks to all of those who supported us
7384,Our digital ordering presence continues to grow and has now improved to approximately 40% of local cases ordered
7385,"This increased utilization is a result of our solid technology platform including improved product images and content, enhanced system capabilities, and increased levels of training"
7386,"Also, as we centralized our support model for multi-unit accounts with tools such as order guide management, both Sysco and our customers have begun to see the benefits of working together to drive efficiencies in the business"
7387,"Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 3.2%"
7388,"While there were some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continue to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements"
7389,"We are now implementing next evolution of tools to help streamline hours, improve delivery, and drive warehouse efficiencies"
7390,"From an administrative cost perspective, we continue to focus on managing these expenses throughout the organization"
7391,"Effectively managing overall cost structure remains a key priority for us, and we continue to focus on a variety of opportunities to deliver improvement"
7392,A key pillar of Sysco's strategy for growth and value creation is the continuous assessment of new market opportunities
7393,"As many of you know, we recently acquired HFM FoodService, a Hawaii-based broadline distributor with approximately $290 million in annual sales"
7394,HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years
7395,We're excited to welcome them to Sysco family
7396,"Acquiring HFM provides Sysco with direct access to the growing Hawaiian market and is in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined, profitable growth of the business"
7397,We will report this business in our U.S
7398,Foodservice segment going forward
7399,"Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter"
7400,"With sales growing 6%, gross profit growing 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%"
7401,"Driven by investments in our European supply chain transformation, transition costs associated with a new large customer in Mexico, and currency translation in Canada"
7402,Overall adjusted operating income declined by 8% for the quarter
7403,Our business in Canada is off to a great start this year
7404,"We are experiencing local case growth in most regions, especially in major markets"
7405,We are also thoughtfully sharing and implementing strategic initiatives from our U.S
7406,"business, such as revenue management and other customer-centric solutions, including online ordering, to their business"
7407,"These capabilities, along with a more focused approach to local customers, have translated into accelerated local case growth"
7408,"Additionally, we are effectively managing our cost structure and improving supply chain efficiencies to help maintain a healthy gap between gross profit growth and expense growth to drive our overall performance"
7409,"Our European business is facing some macroeconomic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the UK"
7410,"Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation of about 9% during the first quarter"
7411,"While we expect these headwinds in the UK to continue throughout our fiscal year, we are actively managing the business to mitigate these impacts"
7412,"As for our business in Latin America, we are excited about the growth opportunities in this region, although there were some weakness due to the recent earthquakes in Mexico City and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico that I mentioned earlier"
7413,"In Costa Rica, we continued to see solid growth as we continue expanding our Cash & Carry footprint"
7414,"Additionally, subsequent to the close of our first quarter, we have completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Mayca business in Costa Rica"
7415,"We will use cash to complete this transaction, and our debt levels will not be affected"
7416,"We initially purchased 50% of the business in 2014, and we are very pleased with the performance thus far, as adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the past three years"
7417,We look forward to continued success with the Mayca team
7418,"Lastly, our SYGMA segment continues to grow"
7419,We are focused on implementing operational improvements that will contribute to long-term operating income improvement
7420,"In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory that we're on for fiscal 2018, to close out our three-year plan"
7421,"Despite the severe weather-related challenges we faced in Q1, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customer's experience, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver the high end of our adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million"
7422,"Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer"
7423,"So, John, good morning"
7424,It's Tom
7425,What I would say is that we talked a lot over the last couple years about all the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area and that we felt good that they were going to help us both in deflationary and inflationary times
7426,"And what I would just reiterate is that a lot of those tools – because what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted: meat, poultry, dairy"
7427,"And so what they really allow us to do is effectively pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts over the short-term as well"
7428,"So, it's really a matter of week-by-week providing our salespeople the right information, insight and guidance on how to basically price and be competitive in the marketplace"
7429,"So, I assume – let's start with margin"
7430,"When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin"
7431,"And generally speaking, the margin – gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the U.S"
7432,"But their cost structures tend to be a little higher as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin"
7433,"A lot of the activity that we've started to share, they have their own kind of category management approach and program, but we're starting to share more information between the European team and the U.S"
7434,team around how we might think about that process going forward
7435,"So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs"
7436,But I'd say the bigger areas are probably around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model here
7437,"We've talked over the last couple of years about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio in our Sysco Brand, and those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learnings out of the U.S"
7438,and share those best practices in Europe
7439,And we've started that process already with that team
7440,The only other thing
7441,was fuel
7442,And so where's (28:48) about a penny detriment on fuel versus prior year
7443,"And the buildout, the cost comments that Joel made from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business and the impacts of the – some of the storms, we still are basically paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, et cetera, without any case activity during those times"
7444,"And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense from an operating perspective as well"
7445,"So, Ed, I assume you're talking about gross profit per case"
7446,"So, it's a really good question given the inflationary environment we're experiencing"
7447,"So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously, we haven't seen margin expansion during this time of inflation"
7448,"So, we continue to feel good about that and that's a combination of things"
7449,It's the category management effort we've had going
7450,"We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco Brand, another 82-basis-point improvement with our local customers, which is again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco Brand, and help them maintain their cost, while also delivering improved margins for us, is a kind of a win-win in there"
7451,"And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly"
7452,"And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multi-unit side, as we continue to go forward throughout the year"
7453,Yeah
7454,"I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is that obviously, we continue to see some inflation through at least the balance of the calendar year"
7455,"There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California"
7456,"So, there are going be some continued areas we're going to have to deal with"
7457,"And again, as w talked – from the first question – I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this"
7458,"But as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly and fairly aggressively is where we run into the biggest challenge and we just – always you (35:42) need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it, but I think we're doing a pretty good job"
7459,"Hey, Vinnie"
7460,"So, yeah, I would say it's relatively as we had expected and on plan"
7461,"Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked"
7462,The transformation efforts in the UK continue
7463,"We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France"
7464,"And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of"
7465,"But there are some things we've not – need to get in place and operating the way we'd want, to get that type of growth in the future"
7466,"The only other thing we already talked about with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have, the inflation there driven by the currency issues are significant"
7467,"So, 9% inflation is a massive number"
7468,And we are seeing impacts from that
7469,"And we see that unfortunately, continuing for some period of time here"
7470,"So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this that – that's different than what we had hoped or expected"
7471,"Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts but it's sustained at fairly high levels for quite a while now"
7472,"Chris, from a Sysco Brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years and our total business is up 62 basis points and 82 basis points with our local customers"
7473,"So, we continue to see opportunities there"
7474,And we get asked this often is how high is – could it go? And I don't think we really have a good view of that
7475,And the reason I say that is what we continue to focus on is bringing very high quality products to the market at very competitive pricing
7476,"And I think as our customers continue to feel different impacts whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases or other challenges they might feel in their business, product costs' always going be there"
7477,And we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco Brand
7478,"So, the other thing we've done – we've talked about is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco Brand to the market"
7479,And I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers and that's why we see these increases
7480,"So, I know that didn't answer you directly, but what I'd say is we continue to invest here"
7481,We feel good about it
7482,I talked about this brand revitalization effort
7483,"We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products"
7484,"So, we – we're doing a lot of work in that area and it's – appears to be resonating nicely with our customers"
7485,"Hey, Marisa"
7486,I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to
7487,I think we feel really good about the U.S
7488,Broadline business and we talk about it in context here of our U.S
7489,Foodservice Operations segment
7490,"And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well"
7491,"So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter"
7492,"So, I – the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin given all those circumstances, we feel actually very good about that business"
7493,"Again, I'd say as we always talk, that's an average"
7494,"So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time and that's where we leverage things like Sysco Brand"
7495,"And, candidly, we share a lot of information with our customers, so this isn't about just us moving our pricing"
7496,"We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories and why the costs are going up from suppliers the way they are"
7497,"So, it's – we're pretty transparent in that area and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people so they can obviously educate our customers"
7498,"When you say non-restaurant customers, are you just talking about other segments within"
7499,"I think that we continue – we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment that we operate in, our customer segments, and our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments"
7500,"As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the foodservice management and also in the retail foodservice"
7501,"So, I think the other segments continue to grow"
7502,Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us and we are performing well there also
7503,"So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments"
7504,"And I'd like to mention (45:47), other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers, we feel really good about where we are"
7505,I think it's commentary not necessarily on fast food but on independent restaurants and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow
7506,"And so, there are, obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers"
7507,"And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market"
7508,Yes
7509,In many cases it was
7510,(48:38)
7511,"I would say, ex a couple of key geographies, right? So whether it's here in the southeast where there are restaurants that are still closed or in parts of Florida like the Keys, where things are – many things are still closed"
7512,Much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state
7513,"So, I would say yes, in general"
7514,"And, Andy, that was all based on case"
7515,"All based on case volume, right"
7516,We didn't project any impact on a rate basis from gross profit per case
7517,We just looked at purely at cases
7518,"And you asked about the 3%, we think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets"
7519,I don't have anything really incremental to add
7520,"I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts from – as you mentioned, from inflation and some of the macros in the UK"
7521,"Let me – I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel embellish on kind of our broader strategy there"
7522,The – let's start with the Mayca in Costa Rica
7523,"So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with back in 2014. We feel great about the partnership we've had with the folks at Mayca"
7524,"And as I shared, the results have been very positive over the last couple of years"
7525,So we exercised our option to basically acquire that business completely recently
7526,"And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously them doing a great job in their marketplace"
7527,"Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition and a market within the U.S"
7528,that's been white space for us
7529,"Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint"
7530,"We'd have no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a white space opportunity that we're very excited about"
7531,"They're a terrific distributor with businesses on a lot of the islands, and are really excited about what we can do together in Hawaii"
7532,"As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it and where you might see us focusing"
7533,"Shane, did they accelerate? So, I mean, when you think about this, we're – we break our U.S"
7534,out into six markets
7535,"And so, as you guys know, I mean, different things drive the business in different markets, not the least which is overall population growth, economic impact"
7536,"So, what – as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the U.S"
7537,"And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared regarding the impacts due to the hurricane in primarily what we call in our South and Southeast markets"
7538,"We continue to feel very good about the growth that we've had in the – both local, and as I mentioned, change in multi-unit"
7539,And it is obviously both
7540,We track both penetration which means more sales to existing customers as well as new lost business
7541,"And I would say in each of those areas, they've continued to grow"
7542,"In Foodservice and generally, new business is very important because there are a fair amount of customers each year that cycle for various reasons"
7543,"And so, I'd – it's a pretty good balance actually of both though"
7544,"And I'd say the thing for us that we've really tried to focus on is penetration because we believe that the more products and service that we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more – what we call maybe stickiness or loyalty from those customers"
7545,"You heard me talk in the past about loyalty and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement in the first quarter"
7546,"So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers as far as what we're providing them"
7547,"First of all, I think you articulated it actually pretty well"
7548,"And so, I think that that's – it was good to hear that what we said is – was translated, I guess, by you in the right way"
7549,"I think, there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about"
7550,We do see it continuing to grow
7551,But the other segment that we all know is growing is this – kind of think about as prepared meals and this ability to get your – whatever your favorite restaurant is delivered to you now versus having to either go there to dine in or even to go pick it up
7552,And we continue to see that movement happening
7553,"And there are lots of different folks getting into that space now in these prepared foods that are both retail, but also in many cases in foodservice outlets that are handling that"
7554,"And so I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy"
7555,"And so, that's really – is what we were trying to refer to there"
7556,Yes to your first part of your question and comment
7557,"And as far as meal kits, yeah, it's part of it"
7558,"It's a fairly small segment and while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space right now"
7559,"I think what we're seeing, though, is there are – think about it, instead of someone like a Blue Apron where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers or for consumers on a local level, whether that be an independent or a chain who are providing that same type of service"
7560,"Good morning, everyone"
7561,I'm glad to be back in IR and I certainly look forward to working with all of you in the future
7562,"But before we jump into results, let's remind you of a few things"
7563,"We're broadcasting this call over the Internet and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany"
7564,com
7565,"On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA and economic profit"
7566,Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations
7567,"Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks, or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings"
7568,"In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release"
7569,Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements
7570,Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans
7571,Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans
7572,The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
7573,"With that, I'll cover results"
7574,"For the total company, fourth quarter volume and sales grew 3%, with sales growing all across all segments"
7575,Our sales in the track channels remain healthy
7576,"We continue to see particularly strong growth in non-track channels including growth in e-Commerce, Home Hardware and Club"
7577,"Turning to results by segment; in Cleaning, Q4 volume grew 4% and sales increased 2%"
7578,"Cleaning segment topline was driven by Home Care behind record quarterly shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, early successes of new Scentiva wipes and sprays, as well as broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio"
7579,"We are especially pleased with the growth of our wipes business this quarter, given we have fully lapped last year's distribution gain in the Club channel"
7580,"Overall, Home Care delivered a third consecutive year of very strong market share growth, hitting 20% on a 52-week basis, its highest share in six years"
7581,"Our Professional Products business volume increased, although sales were flat following double-digit sales growth in the year ago quarter"
7582,Volume gains were broad-based with contributions from a number of recent innovations in the surface disinfecting space
7583,"Lastly, within our Cleaning segment, laundry sales and volume declined, primarily due to category softness"
7584,"Positively, however, we continue to grow our premium Clorox Splash-less Bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach"
7585,"Turning to Household segment; fourth quarter volume increased 5% and sales grew 4%, reflecting strong topline growth in Renew Life, Cat Litter and Glad"
7586,Starting with Cat Litter; sales grew double-digits behind innovation and strong merchandising support
7587,This also was the third consecutive quarter of market share growth for litter supported by our prior launch of Fresh Step with Febreze
7588,"Our Glad bags and wraps business saw solid topline growth behind ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, particularly in the Club channel, which more than offset the decline on our base business"
7589,"Although overall track channel market share for Glad was down in the quarter, we continue to see – we continue to gain share consistent with our strategy in the higher-margin premium trash bag segment and our OdorShield trash bag delivered all-time record volume in fiscal year 2017. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in non-track channels, including Club, Home Hardware, and notably, e-Commerce"
7590,"Fourth quarter non-trackable shipments were flat, in line with our expectations"
7591,We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is on track
7592,"Finally, we remain excited about Renew Life"
7593,Our distribution expansion plans remain on track with gains in the Food/Drug/Mass channel and behind dual placement strategies at key accounts as well as very strong growth in e-Commerce
7594,We will continue to focus on expanding distribution in fiscal year 2018. And we've begun supporting this business with a new national marketing campaign
7595,Turning to Lifestyle; volume declined 1% and sales grew 2%
7596,Burt's Bees delivered solid topline growth this quarter on top of double-digit topline growth in the year ago quarter
7597,The business also drove share gains behind incremental distribution and merchandising activities in lip care
7598,We have a strong innovation lineup for fiscal year 2018 with some of these items already on shelve
7599,"In our Food business, volume declined slightly due to lower shipments of KC Masterpiece barbecue sauces"
7600,"That said, consumption and shares in our key segments remain healthy and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley equity delivered a tenth consecutive quarter of share growth"
7601,"To wrap up the Lifestyle segment, Brita sales were flat in Q4 as gains from innovation behind our Stream pitcher were offset primarily by strong competitive activities and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower margin part of our portfolio"
7602,"Finally, turning to International, volume and sales were up in Q4 despite more than 3 points of FX headwinds, and slower category growth in countries like Argentina and Peru due to macroeconomic trends"
7603,We continue to take pricing to offset unfavorable foreign exchange as part of our larger effort to improve margin
7604,"Now I'll turn it over to Steve, to provide more details on our fiscal 2017 performance as well as outlook for fiscal year 2018."
7605,I think we have one more question after this
7606,Thank you

7619,"With that, I'll cover our Q1 business performance, discussing highlights in each of our segments"
7620,"Steve will then address our financial results as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018. Finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A"
7621,"For the total company, first quarter volume and sales, each grew 4%, with sales growing across all four segments"
7622,"Sales in tracked channels remain healthy and we continue to see very strong growth in non-tracked channels, particularly in e-commerce and clubs"
7623,I will now turn to our results by segment
7624,"In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume and sales, each grew 5%"
7625,Sales growth this quarter also include less than two points of benefits from shipments related to the recent hurricane
7626,"Cleaning segment's strong top line growth was led by home care, which grew by high-single digits on top of the double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter"
7627,"We're very pleased by the continued momentum of our largest SBU, especially as the growth continues to reflect broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio, with all-time record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, as well as our recently introduced Scentiva wipes and sprays"
7628,"Consistent with these results, home care delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains"
7629,"In laundry, sales and volume grew mainly behind shipments of Clorox liquid bleach, as retailers stock-up for hurricane-related purchases"
7630,The quarter's results also reflect continued growth in our premium Clorox Splash-Less bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach
7631,"Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our professional products volume and sales were flat, reflecting the divestiture of the Aplicare business in late August"
7632,The balance of professional products business is performing strongly
7633,"Turning to Household segment, first quarter volume increased 7% and sales grew 5%, with broad-based growth across all business units"
7634,"Starting with our Glad bags and wraps business, sales growth was driven by ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, especially in e-com and the club channel as well as slight gain from hurricane-related shipments"
7635,"In Charcoal, volume grew slightly while sales declined slightly, due to unfavorable mix as well as higher trade promotion investments to support our business"
7636,We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is healthy
7637,Cat Litter volume and sales each grew by high-single digits behind our Fresh Step innovation and strong merchandising support
7638,We're pleased with the strong momentum we are seeing on this business as reflected by four consecutive quarters of market share growth
7639,"Finally, turning to RenewLife, Q1 was the first full quarter lapping the acquisition"

7643,"Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter, behind the introduction of our new natural cosmetics line, and first-ever distribution expansion of lip care in the club channel"
7644,Burt's Bees grew share in the quarter and we're very pleased with our share gains in the lip color category
7645,"In our Brita business, volume and sales declined as gains from innovation behind our new Stream pitcher were more than offset by lower club channel merchandising and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower-margin part of our portfolio"
7646,"That said, the Stream pitcher is performing well six months after launch, and is now the number two pour-through item behind our Brita Legacy pitcher, which is the market leader"
7647,"To wrap up Lifestyle, food volume and sales grew behind strong merchandising in club and grocery channels for bottled Hidden Valley dressings"
7648,"Consumptions remain very strong, and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley brand delivered 11th consecutive quarter of share growth"
7649,"Finally, turning to International"
7650,"Volume was down 2%, although sales grew 1%"
7651,"Sales growth reflects the benefits of pricing and innovation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and weaker volume in Argentina due to macroeconomic conditions, and in Puerto Rico, from the impact of the hurricanes"
7652,"We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement, while selectively investing in Burt's Bees, RenewLife, laundry and home care"
7653,"Now, I'll turn it over to Steve, who'll provide more information on our Q1 performance and discuss our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018."
7654,We'll take one more question
7655,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone"
7656,Our company delivered an excellent performance in the third quarter
7657,"Our business accelerated, driven by many brands, channels and markets that experienced strong momentum"
7658,"In constant currency, our sales rose 9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 28%, both of which exceeded our expectations"
7659,"The outperformance was generated from stronger organic sales growth, largely in China in travel retail channel; a better-than-expected performance of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, as well as disciplined expense management"
7660,"When fiscal 2017 began, we said our sales were expected to accelerate every quarter, culminating in a robust second half"
7661,"As we look to the fourth quarter, our sales growth should increase farther, enabling us to deliver our financial and sales target for the full year and position us for a strong start in fiscal year 2018. Our success this quarter came despite continued external macro headwinds in certain areas"
7662,", foot traffic continued to decline in brick-and-mortar department stores, our largest domestic channel"
7663,"And Macy's closed 68 stores, as expected"
7664,"In certain other countries, we faced difficult economic or political climates, particularly in the Middle East, Turkey and Latin America"
7665,And the continued strength of the dollar impacted our reported results
7666,"Globally, we encountered stiff competition from both established and upstart brands"
7667,"The fact that we have achieved a strong performance against this backdrop speaks to our successful strategy, which is anchored by our increasingly diversified business model and multiple engines of growth"
7668,We also are benefiting from our choice to stay focused on a dynamic prestige industry that has been growing steadily for many years and continues to grow faster than many other household and personal care centers
7669,"As global prestige beauty undergoes rapid change, we are embracing new opportunities, accelerating penetration of the fastest-growing channels, reallocating resources to the leading business drivers and pivoting for the future in our industry"
7670,"Consumers' appetite for beauty products is intensifying, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup, which fuel outstanding growth in our high-end brands and continued double-digit growth in our makeup category"
7671,"In addition, we enjoyed superb growth in the fastest-growing beauty channels, with travel retail, online and specialty multi, each rising strong double-digits"
7672,"By geography, we grew strong double digits in certain emerging markets, notably China"
7673,"Altogether, we generated higher sales in every region and in our three largest product categories, fueled by an acceleration of our hero products, new product innovation and increased social media presence, new digital initiatives and greater penetration in the fastest high-growth channels"
7674,"At the same time, we continued investing in priority areas and capabilities and our Leading Beauty Forward initiative"
7675,Our diverse portfolio of brands continues to be a strategic advantage
7676,We leveraged each brand in the most appropriate prestige distribution channels to target different consumer segments
7677,"This approach yielded outstanding results for our luxury brands including Tom Ford, La Mer and Jo Malone"
7678,Each generated double-digit sales growth in constant currency in every region
7679,La Mer's new hydrating serum and brightening mask were well received and benefit from an increase in travel in Chinese consumers around the world
7680,The brand gained share in Asia-Pacific and maintained its leading position in luxury skin care there
7681,"Among our largest brands, Estée Lauder achieved the solid growth globally for the second consecutive quarter, with higher sales in skin care, makeup and fragrances"
7682,"The brand was well positioned to capitalize on increased travel and consumption from Chinese consumers, which favorably impacted its business in travel retail, the UK, and Asian markets and lifted its skin care sales"
7683,"Estée Lauder's makeup category excelled in Asia-Pacific with increases in face, lip and eye products"
7684,"The Estée Lauder brand continued to support its two key hero franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, with new products combined with more effective marketing and communication"
7685,The investment paid off
7686,"The two highly desirable product lines reached the new consumer, posted positive growth in every region and increased double digit for the fiscal year-to-date"
7687,"Around the world, Double Wear is the best-selling prestige foundation in many markets such as the U.K"
7688,"and attracts consumers across generation to the brand, including millennials"
7689,"We have successfully created a new growth engine with our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands and they continued to advance strongly, while at the same time improve the profitability of the entire fragrance category"
7690,"Jo Malone and Tom Ford accelerated rapidly, particularly in travel retail and we also see great potential for our newer fragrance brands, Le Labo, Frédéric Malle and By Kilian"
7691,"This is the first full quarter that reflected a contribution of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA and their sales exceeded our expectations"
7692,We also started to extend their presence internationally
7693,Adding these brands to our portfolio accelerated our penetration in both makeup and in the fast-growing specialty multichannel and increases our reach with millennial consumers
7694,"Indeed, many of our brands are expanding in fast growing channels to reach new consumer"
7695,"Since today, they have wider choices of where to shop for prestige beauty products"
7696,"In this regard, we are excited our M"
7697,A

7710,is the leading brand on sephora
7711,com and will open in some of the retailers' top brick-and-mortar stores this August

7715,And over 65% of the new makeup consumers were millennials
7716,"With strong sales results, Estée Lauder plans to roll out to more Ulta stores"
7717,Clinique's experience in Ulta has been terrific and it is building on its business there with more in-store boutiques
7718,"By the end of fiscal 2017, our three largest brands will have strategically expanded their consumer reach in the U.S"
7719,specialty-multi channel
7720,Several of our other brands have achieved strong sales in the U.S
7721,", specialty multi, including GLAMGLOW, Smashbox, Tom Ford in Sephora and Darphin in Bluemercury"
7722,"During the quarter, we launched Jo Malone and La Mer into a few key Sephora doors, including its largest one that recently opened in Manhattan, and also on sephora"
7723,Initial response has been terrific
7724,Both brands are recruiting new consumers from these efforts
7725,"Internationally, our business has also performed well in many specialty multi retailers, including Mecca, Boots, Douglas and (11:18)"
7726,"More specialty multi retailers are entering Korea, and Clinique and Origins have expanded their consumer reach to some of these new locations"
7727,Clinique and M
7728,has launched in specialty multi in Thailand with fantastic results
7729,"We had outstanding results in travel retail, led by our business in Asia-Pacific"
7730,Our vibrant retail sales showed the strongest quarterly growth in over three years and far outpaced passenger traffic growth in the quarter
7731,Sales increase in every product category
7732,"Makeup sales surged, led by M"
7733,", Tom Ford, and several other brands"
7734,Higher skin care sales were driven by Estée Lauder and La Mer in the greater number of Chinese and other Asian travelers
7735,"And in fragrance, which still leads total beauty sales in the channel, we achieved the superior results and share growth, led by Jo Malone and Tom Ford"
7736,"We believe there will be strong demand among consumers for our newer luxury and artisanal fragrance brands in travel retail as we roll them out, enabling us to further penetrate the channel's most important category"
7737,"We also continue to expand the availability of our other brands that aren't widely distributed in travel retail, and brought more brands into more high potential airports"
7738,"Our sales from our e-commerce channels continue to grow at an exceptional pace, up 30% globally, more than twice the growth of e-commerce in general"
7739,"Sales rose double-digits across brand, retailers, and third-party sites, and also grew double digit in every region, driven largely by increased traffic, order size, and conversion"
7740,Mobile-driven sales rose significantly and are now a larger portion of our total mix
7741,"We entered Hong Kong, a new market for our online business, with a brand size from GLAMGLOW"
7742,"And in China, our online sales soared, led by our brands on Tmall"
7743,"plans to launch on Tmall this quarter, which should provide more fuel for our China business and allow M"
7744,to reach new shoppers in smaller Chinese cities who don't have access to its products in brick-and-mortar stores
7745,"Globally, we continue to successfully launch additional brands online in more markets"
7746,Department stores are striving to provide consumers with strong experiences they can't get anywhere else
7747,"International department stores remain strong, particularly in Europe and China"
7748,We continue to work our – with our U.S
7749,"department stores to create in-store and omni-channel excitement and innovate with product, services, merchandising, and education"
7750,"We are devoting additional resources to the top doors and promoting in-store events on retailers' websites where, as I just mentioned, our business had been brisk"
7751,Research shows the consumer who shop both in-store and online spend more than those who buy in just one channel
7752,"We are being proactive with department stores to design strategies to reinvigorate traffic, while addressing productivity challenges in brick-and-mortar"
7753,"Now, let me turn to our recent and upcoming innovations"
7754,"Across our brands, we are focused on the biggest global opportunities, which in Clinique's case means its core products, like moisturizers"
7755,"Its initial launch of Fresh Pressed serum and cleanser with concentrate Vitamin C was a global hit that garnered terrific attention and demand, and validated the brand's strength to leverage the initial success with a more extensive rollout in the coming months"
7756,"The serum is used with the brand's moisturizers, which increases their sales as well"
7757,Fresh Pressed helped drive improving retail trends for Clinique in China and travel retail
7758,"In another move to strengthen its position in moisturizers, Clinique just introduced a supercharged hydrating formula of Moisture Surge, developed from proprietary (15:45) technology that is expected to elevate the best-selling franchise"
7759,"Clinique marketing will focus on the instant benefits of Moisture Surge, which has been growing in most markets"
7760,Estée Lauder will begin introducing Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix in July
7761,"This product, which contains innovative technology based on scientific breakthrough research, repairs the visible signs of aging on eyes to make eyes look refreshed, and features a custom designed massage applicator"
7762,It is one of the brand's highest scoring products in testing with consumers
7763,"For example, after four weeks of usage, almost 90% of women said their eyes looked more youthful"
7764,"It will be supported by a 360-degree campaign, based on strong insights from consumers around the world"
7765,"In makeup, we are very excited about Estée Lauder Double Wear Cushion Compact for Asian market, which will be supported by strong investment in China, and Pure Color Love lipstick, a global launch that is aimed at younger consumers"
7766,M•A•C new Next to Nothing sheer Face Color is a lightweight foundation that makes skin glow
7767,It is being supported with a major social media campaign that is already helping fuel M•A•C sales this quarter
7768,"In fragrance, Jo Malone launched Star Magnolia cologne, which is expected to have wide appeal, and Tom Ford created SOLE DI POSITANO, which evokes my fragrant (17:28) Italian coast"
7769,"With the help of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, we continue to reallocate resources faster, and cut cost deeper, to invest in talent and capabilities that will drive our business in today evolving beauty landscape"
7770,"This includes social media, digital technologies, retail operations, and analytical expertise"
7771,"To help leverage both new and existing brands, our brands continue to increase their social media activity and capabilities to engage consumers across numerous digital platforms using influencers, brand ambassadors, and other compelling voices and technologies"
7772,"For example, Smashbox collaborated with a popular influencer to help promote its Cover Shot Eye Palette, and the collection became one of the brand's largest launch ever"
7773,"And in China, the Estée Lauder brand significantly lifted its makeup sales by leveraging a combination of in-store and social media campaigns"
7774,This kind of digital content created by influencers and third-parties is measured in terms of earned media value
7775,"In the third quarter, M•A•C remained the second largest beauty brand among prestige and mass makeup players in earned media value in the U.S"
7776,", as measured by Tribe Dynamics"
7777,M•A•C has improved its earned media value share in makeup in each of the last three quarters
7778,Our brands are also creating inventive digital experience for consumers
7779,"For example, a cutting edge technology used by Estée Lauder and Smashbox lets consumers virtually apply different lipstick shades, either in real-time or in (19:16)"
7780,"Our performance this quarter further demonstrated our company strategy, built on multiple engines of growth and leading to agile resource reallocation, when need, is sustainable and working"
7781,Our company has the most desirable portfolio of prestige brands in the industry
7782,And we are (19:38) to strategically deploy them brand across fastest-growing channels and consumer segments around the world
7783,"Importantly, we have the highest quality workforce with extremely capable people committed to our company's success"
7784,"At the same time, we are reducing costs, redesigned for better sales growth leverage, and reallocating our resources to make priority investment in the most attractive areas that are expected to drive our growth in both the fourth quarter and next year"
7785,"As a successful high growth company in a growing industry, we have continued to increase our global share in prestige beauty"
7786,"And as we enter our fourth quarter, we are further building momentum to deliver another year of strong profitable growth"
7787,"Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey"
7788,"So the growth is very, very strong in these two brands"
7789,"So, it's very strong double-digit growth in each one of the two brands and in every segment they're operating"
7790,"And what is driving the success is actually same-door sales is a success, which is driven mainly by same-door sales and for the moment, a very small initial distribution deployment"
7791,These two brands are really strong and consumer demand is exceptional
7792,And their recent launches are among the most successful launches in the entire marketplace
7793,"And on top of that, for us, the great news are that they attract really new consumers that in the past we were attracting less, particularly Too Faced attract more younger consumers in our portfolio which is great extra business for the company overall"
7794,"And importantly, they have dramatically increased our penetration in Specialty Multi in the U.S"
7795,"And this will continue internationally, which is a very important objective because as you all know, the Specialty Multi-Channel globally is one of the fastest growing channels in our sector"
7796,I'll start with answering the ULTA question
7797,So Clinique is very successful in the ULTA channel
7798,"And what we have learned is that when Clinique is exposed with all the strengths of the core (32:42) portfolio and the strengths of services to a good growing traffic, the brand responds very, very well"
7799,And Clinique is growing both makeup and skin care aggressively in every ULTA door in which the brand is deployed
7800,"In terms of what we can learn for M•A•C – by the way, as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan to increase gradually the number of Clinique doors in ULTA in agreement with our retail partner"
7801,"And, as far as the learning for M•A•C, absolutely we have learned a lot for perfecting our upcoming M•A•C execution; also from the Clinique experience"
7802,"In particular, we have learned the importance of the service aspect, of making sure that the brand is deployed with all the necessarily SKU, assortment SKU, and decorations of the SKUs to the consumer, is the concept of a curated assortment that really fit the consumer, which has been a big learning that will be absolutely applied to every one of our brands"
7803,"The good news, that is true for Clinique based on your question, but is true for every other – our three big brands"
7804,We really attract new consumers and a lot of millennial consumers
7805,"So the cannibalization is very, very limited"
7806,"This consumer, our consumer that were not shopping in the brands before in a large majority, or they were lapsed brand users, because they were not anymore going in channels that – where the brands today are distributed"
7807,So the large majority of the business is net extra business
7808,"So on the total M•A•C growth, no"
7809,We're not seeing a big change
7810,"Overall, it's still between 4% and 5%; probably closer to 4% in this moment than to 5%, but still in the range"
7811,And – but what we have seen a change – we see a change continuously is where the growth is coming from
7812,"And the growth is coming from – by category – is coming more from makeup than in the past, as you know"
7813,"And by recently, in this quarter, the growth is again coming from Asia more than in the previous quarters"
7814,"And then, certain emerging markets have been more challenged than in the past, like, I don't know, Brazil or Turkey, obviously, and a few others"
7815,"And so, we see a variation where the growth come from"
7816,But what is interesting is actually the total growth is still between 4% and 5%
7817,"So, let me start from this last question, is – no, is what I said"
7818,"You should not model it differently; is 25 by June and then 100, and you can assume that the 100 will be equally split, because it's a matter of capability opening"
7819,"And the opening will be more aggressive as of September, obviously, because of organization and capability things"
7820,But this is the total number that we're planning for at the moment
7821,What was the?
7822,"Ah, the earned media value of M•A•C"
7823,"So what was driving the improvement of the earned media value of M•A•C is, first of all, the M•A•C activation of many more influencers"
7824,"And the activation also of M•A•C makeup artist has influenced themselves, which is a unique model created by the M•A•C brand"
7825,"Meaning M•A•C is, obviously, activity is external influencer, (39:17), but also, many of the very valuable makeup artists of M•A•C influence themselves"
7826,"And being enabled by a lot of great quality asset to support to do this job around the world, and particularly in the U.S"
7827,"The other thing is, activity in this, is M•A•C is back launching hero products"
7828,"And as you know, a lot of these media value is driven by exciting new products"
7829,"For example, Next to Nothing launch, which I mentioned in my prepared remark, is an activity which is creating a lot of conversation in the social media arena, which is helping support the brand"
7830,We believe this strength will continue
7831,The M•A•C brand is very active among the various changes they're leading in the U.S
7832,market and internationally in increasing the numbers of hero products that will be passed of their deployed portfolio of innovation
7833,"So, let me start from this line"
7834,I think we said it in prepared remark and everywhere we comment on this new distribution
7835,The new distribution is bringing new customers
7836,And so we have absolute evidence
7837,"That's why we have tested our way first with 30 doors, then in certain areas internationally, the same"
7838,We have done this very gradually with a lot of attention
7839,And there is – the large majority of consumers are new to the brands
7840,"This is true for new distribution, both online in specialty and this is true for a lot of our new innovation which is focused on segments where we have strategic opportunities or strategic gaps"
7841,And that's actually been the big strength
7842,And the other information we – that I have already shared but I want to further clarify it is that the large majority of these new consumers are millennials
7843,And that's true in all these things that we have
7844,"We have year-end data that comport all these learnings and then based on this data, we made decision on distribution evolutions around the world"
7845,"And then in term of profit dilution of the new distribution, M•A•C is very dependent from traffic"
7846,"And so if we – where we are able to create good sales per door, M•A•C is a profitable brand"
7847,And so our priority is to stay focused on really making M•A•C a good brand with great sales per door in every single distribution channel and that will make M•A•C – will keep M•A•C as a very profitable brand
7848,"And in term of the overall dynamic, I want again to clarify the – M•A•C exposure to, in this moment, the declining brick-and-mortar department store traffic is the key issue we are trying to solve"
7849,M•A•C has enormous demand and attention from consumers
7850,It's a very desirable brand
7851,"Wherever M•A•C is exposed to traffic, it's performing well"
7852,And that's the key issue we are trying to work on
7853,"As we said, we have many international pockets where M•A•C is booming"
7854,And we need to address the U.S
7855,issue as we have discussed
7856,And I hope you see many of the pivoting activity that we are doing to achieve this goal as fast as possible
7857,Our growth algorithm is 6% to 8% and we are obviously on this trend
7858,And the key point is this industry is not a zero-sum game
7859,All the big companies are growing
7860,"And depending by quarter and by year, some are growing a bit less or a bit more, but we all are growing"
7861,So the key point is that there is a strong category growth and there is space to grow for a lot of big companies
7862,"And they believe that small brands are diluting the growth of big companies is clearly not demonstrated by the facts, because big companies are growing, are growing their brands and enriching their portfolios"
7863,"If there are some smaller brands which are doing very well, some of them get acquired by the big companies when they have the right rate of return"
7864,And so I believe actually this is an environment where many big companies can grow and can grow at the same time in this amazing part of the industry which is prestige beauty
7865,"Now, what do I attribute in the short-term in the last six months, nine months? Our growth be below some of our competitor is frankly 80% U.S"
7866,department store traffic
7867,We are the company which has the highest exposure in percentage of our business and in our big brands to U.S
7868,department store traffic
7869,"And then there are other – many, many other areas of the world where frankly we are growing faster than many other companies"
7870,"And the last point I want to make, we are building market share"
7871,"So in a market we continue to grow 4% to 5%, we continue to grow market share"
7872,This was evident also in the recent Unimonitor (52:02) report for 2016 calendar and is obviously proven by these first quarter numbers where we are growing in constant currency 9% versus the market which is probably closer to 4%
7873,So we keep growing market share
7874,"We keep growing well in all over the world and we do have an issue to solve – to address, which is that U.S"
7875,department store traffic and our high penetration of this channel
7876,And we are pivoting to reinforce this channel and at the same time diversify our business in the needed way
7877,Okay
7878,So let's start again
7879,M•A•C is – there've been some recent research issued that M•A•C is the number one brand loved by teenagers in this market in the U.S
7880,", and just been published a research on this"
7881,"All our consumer data showed that M•A•C is among the preferred brands among the millennials and, frankly, all generations"
7882,So M•A•C is a business built to be really very sensitive to traffic
7883,And that's the key thing we need to do
7884,"The brand is in excellent shape, very desirable"
7885,"And as I said, to demonstrate this, there are markets around the world where the brand this quarter has been growing 40% or 45%, despite the competition being the same"
7886,And so it's a very specific opportunity
7887,"Said that, there is definitely a lot of new competition, and every big brand has to face this new competition"
7888,"On this, I would like to make an – to do an observation"
7889,"What we see in the data is that this increasing competition, done by an ever-increasing number of brands, is an increasing competition in the momental (55:06) trial"
7890,"That is, we don't see increasing competition in the area of loyalty and in the area of retention and repeat, which where the profit is"
7891,Let me explain this
7892,"We have, for example, in all our big brands, take Estée Lauder with Advanced Night Repair, take M•A•C with Studio Fix, the big hero products in this moment are getting more success and increased repeat, despite the increased competition"
7893,"What is tougher is to get the attention at the trial moment, because of the many small brands , there's more activity out there (55:42)"
7894,But I would like you to think that the trial moment is not the profitable moment
7895,Trial is an investment
7896,Repeat is a profit
7897,"And so at the end, the profitable brands are still the big brands with great hero product, great repeat, and not many small brands that generate a lot of noise on trial, because unless they get the repeat, they will not be sustainable"
7898,"And so, we are very focused on a sustainable, long-term profitability strategy for our brands, and that's the way we are addressing the issue at M•A•C and the opportunity for all our brands"
7899,"So, the second question was specialty-multi, which is an opportunity for many of our brands, and I mentioned many of them in my prepared remarks, exactly to give you maximum exposure to all the pivoting we're doing"
7900,"Instead of repeating them, I would like just to clarify one point"
7901,Every brand has a unique distribution strategy in the Estée Lauder Company portfolio
7902,"So, we don't do things by channel"
7903,We do things by brand
7904,"So, there are brands which are designed to win well in specialty, brands which are designed to be in multiple channels, and brands that are designed to be more exclusive in a certain channel type"
7905,And our broad portfolio brands give us the possibility to play this growing multichannel portfolio globally in an excellent strategic way
7906,"The last question was on online, and yes, we see a very different pattern in purchases online"
7907,"Purchases online tend to be younger and tend to be, frankly, very profitable, because consumers are very loyal when they get into it"
7908,There's a lot of good repeat
7909,"But most importantly, the online sales allow us to reach consumers that sometimes we cannot reach with brick and mortar"
7910,This is particularly true in emerging markets
7911,"I just gave the good example of China, where a good launch of M•A•C in Tmall that will happen this quarter, we know, by all our analysis, that will expose millions of Chinese consumers in cities of Tier 3 or Tier 4, that today cannot buy the brand, to be able to buy the brand"
7912,"This is true for many other brands in our portfolio, and many of our online activities around the world"
7913,Okay
7914,"I'll start from the Lauder and Clinique question, and Tracey will take over"
7915,"So, first of all, Lauder is growing, so it's not stabilized"
7916,"Lauder has been growing in a very exciting way, in my opinion, this quarter"
7917,And this is the second quarter in a row where the Lauder brand is growing globally
7918,"What is driving that is successful innovation that is hitting new consumers, combined with an amazing work on relaunching hero products, and that's the key point"
7919,"I mean, Double Wear is a fantastic foundation product that millions of consumers around the world love"
7920,"But still, there are millions of consumer that never tried this product"
7921,"And so, the ability of the brand to continue win with winning hero products is the key learning, and this is working very well"
7922,"And, for example, we have learned that Double Wear in specialty-multi attracts Millennials, despite being a foundation that's been there for many years, and being a fantastic product for many years, attract new Millennials to the brand better than maybe specific Millennial launches targeted to Millennial"
7923,So we are now ready to leverage these new discoveries on Lauder and continue the acceleration
7924,"The third thing which is helping the Lauder brand is that the Lauder brand is more exposed, positively exposed, to the Chinese consumers and to the Asian dynamics than the Clinique brand, for example"
7925,The Clinique brand in the country is more exposed to U.S
7926,department store than any other brand in our portfolio together with M•A•C U.S
7927,"But globally, Clinique is more exposed in total"
7928,"So the key point is that Lauder benefited from the comeback of growth in Asia and it being part of one of the brands, driving the comeback of skin care in Asia"
7929,"And so the research of Asia, Asia skin care is obviously helping the Lauder brand and in our opinion will continue to grow – to support the growth of the Lauder brand"
7930,"The learning for Clinique are the same, is more hero products, more activity on innovation that on top of building specific new products, build existing hero products, the Pressed Fresh Vitamin C launch is an example of that"
7931,"Vitamin C is a new product per se, but at the same time create regimen with existing moisturizer of Clinique and so sell and build hero products and we have tested these successfully in the last year"
7932,The art of learning for Clinique is that also Clinique need to accelerate the entrance in growing channels
7933,So also Clinique is further accelerating the expansion in the successful specialty multi-channels where it's playing and online
7934,"And so we will continue to do that and, sorry, the last thing on Clinique is the makeup"
7935,Clinique is also working to further activate their makeup innovation and activities in fiscal year 2018 that should further boost the brand
7936,"Thanks, Rob"
7937,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings"
7938,"This is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team"
7939,"Hopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning"
7940,"I'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A"
7941,"There will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties"
7942,Actual results could differ materially from these statements
7943,Please review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials
7944,So let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter
7945,We had a really strong quarter
7946,"On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion"
7947,We delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share
7948,"So we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them"
7949,We recently completed a debt tender offer
7950,We made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter
7951,We made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets
7952,"So excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business"
7953,"comp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%"
7954,We saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes
7955,Our Walmart U.S
7956,eCommerce sales grew 50%
7957,Sam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes
7958,International delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales
7959,"Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us"
7960,"We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S"
7961,comp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares
7962,Just a couple of reminders
7963,"We'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website"
7964,So please mark your calendars for that
7965,"And at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions"
7966,Question-and-Answer Session
7967,"Thanks, Michael"
7968,"Let me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S"
7969,"So on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points"
7970,"And you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S"
7971,hurricane-related expenses that we had
7972,"I'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts"
7973,So just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter
7974,For Walmart U.S
7975,"specifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter"
7976,"Price investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well"
7977,"And the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that"
7978,"So I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price"
7979,"We're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders"
7980,It's really the productivity beginning to turn for us
7981,"So you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses"
7982,"So if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online"
7983,"The fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time"
7984,"Thanks, Oliver"
7985,So the first question around smart cart technology
7986,It's something that we continue to look at
7987,We need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart
7988,"com, but nothing really more to add at this time"
7989,"In terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience"
7990,Think about it as a flagship store
7991,This is expected to launch in the spring
7992,It will be dedicated store on Walmart
7993,"We're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site"
7994,"So we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring"
7995,"Well, I think there's a lot of things"
7996,"If you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S"
7997,"business, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint"
7998,"So, we continue to look at it"
7999,"I think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us"
8000,We continue to make progress on inventory
8001,"You've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business"
8002,"I think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon"
8003,"Well, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up"
8004,"Jet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work"
8005,So there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results
8006,Really the way we think about eCommerce is really in total
8007,Jet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall
8008,We made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S
8009,"eCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole"
8010,"In terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business"
8011,I think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go
8012,"But in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see"
8013,Thank you
8014,Maybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail
8015,So we'll take the inflation piece first
8016,"So the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very – it's – you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter"
8017,The fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets
8018,"As we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward"
8019,"In terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up"
8020,We know that that's working for our customers
8021,We continue to expand it
8022,"We're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year"
8023,So that's a big initiative for us
8024,It's working and our customers love it
8025,"In terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things"
8026,"It's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well"
8027,"Kary, anything else you want to add?"
8028,We won't give the specifics of that
8029,It's working for us based on our rollout plans
8030,"Thanks, Robby"
8031,And I appreciate it
8032,So I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business
8033,"One of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs"
8034,We need to be more efficient
8035,We talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that
8036,We have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have
8037,So that's what we continue to do
8038,I think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business
8039,"We have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception"
8040,But I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing
8041,"Rob, next question please?"
8042,"Well, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped"
8043,But it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall
8044,I know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward
8045,"There's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall"
8046,It's great that we started to see that in the third quarter
8047,We've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that
8048,"But it's not one thing, it's a lot"
8049,"Thanks, Karen"
8050,"Rob, next question please?"
8051,Thanks for your question
8052,"So, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now"
8053,"The details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest"
8054,"So pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line"
8055,"So we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding"
8056,"Well, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S"
8057,population in general
8058,"We're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers"
8059,So we continue to push that forward
8060,"In terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information"
8061,"But we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways"
8062,"We're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year"
8063,"We'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that"
8064,"We do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck"
8065,"So there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer"
8066,"The real – I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well"
8067,"We haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now"
8068,That's really a different product mix and more than anything
8069,"In terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing"
8070,It's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have
8071,"But not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers"
8072,So we continue to watch that and learn from it
8073,And nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have
8074,Maybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul
8075,"In terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S"
8076,"business, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit"
8077,Sam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points
8078,"We talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S"
8079,business and about $20 million for Sam's
8080,So I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint
8081,"In terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic"
8082,So a 3.6% member traffic growth
8083,We have members coming in more frequently
8084,We have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs
8085,And that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter
8086,"Matt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance"
8087,"There was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter"
8088,"I mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side"
8089,"See from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall"
8090,"And one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up"
8091,"So if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual"
8092,I think the key is to be flexible
8093,"If you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense"
8094,"You have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms"
8095,"And then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties"
8096,"So I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options"
8097,"I think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel"
8098,"But, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share"
8099,It's hard to dissect on who from
8100,So I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you
8101,"But thanks for your question, Kate"
8102,Thanks for the question
8103,I think it's TBD
8104,"I think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward"
8105,We have a lot of initiatives underway
8106,"A lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about"
8107,"So I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too"
8108,"We certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time"
8109,So we continue to do that
8110,"Our brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that"
8111,"Bigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot"
8112,It's over 70 million
8113,"In the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million"
8114,So we continue to make progress
8115,Thank you
8116,"Thanks for your question, Joe"
8117,"And we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is – it's a great brand that now is associated with us"
8118,"So, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data"
8119,We analyze the data really well
8120,We know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website
8121,We think it helps the brand overall
8122,So we'll watch brands like that
8123,We're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn
8124,I think pricing is a piece of it
8125,"But I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there"
8126,"Thanks, guys"
8127,We don't have any more questions in the queue
8128,"So I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays"
8129,"Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone"
8130,"Let’s jump right into our fiscal ‘17 financial performance starting with the fourth quarter results summarized on Slide 9. Net sales totaled $3.8 million, down 3% on a reported and organic basis"

8134,Slide 10 shows the components of total company net sales growth in the quarter
8135,Organic pound volume reduced net sales growth by 7 points and was partially offset by 4 points of positive mix and net price realization
8136,"Now, let me turn to full year fiscal ‘17 financial results"
8137,"Net sales totaled $15.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis"
8138,"Total segment operating profit totaled $3 billion even, down 1% in constant currency"
8139,Net earnings decreased 2% to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.77 as reported
8140,"Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.08, up 6% in constant currency"
8141,"For our North America retail segment, organic net sales declined 4% in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the third quarter trend as we saw better performance in measured and non-measured channels"
8142,Full year organic net sales were down 5%
8143,"At the operating unit level, U.S"
8144,"snacks posted net sales growth of 1% in the fourth quarter, an improvement over last quarter led by growth in Annie’s, Nature Valley, and Larabar, which offset declines in Fiber 1. Cereal net sales were down 1% in the quarter, with growth on Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Cheerios offset by declines on Chex and Kix"
8145,"meals and baking net sales decreased 1% in the quarter, with growth on Totino’s hot snacks offset by declines on Pillsbury refrigerated dough"
8146,The full year net sales decline for U.S
8147,meals and baking was due to the divestiture of Green Giant business in fiscal ‘16 as well as declines on soup and refrigerated dough
8148,"Canada constant currency net sales increased 2% in the quarter, with growth on Old El Paso and Betty Crocker"
8149,Full year Canada constant currency net sales declined 2% due entirely to the Green Giant divestiture

8152,Full year constant currency operating profit declined 2% reflecting the impact of the Green Giant divestiture
8153,Fourth quarter organic net sales for our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment were comparable to last year
8154,This was the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement
8155,"Full year segment organic net sales declined 3% with 2% growth on our Focus 6 platforms led by mid single-digit growth on cereal and yogurt, offset market index pricing on bakery flour and declines on frozen dough products"
8156,"Segment operating profit grew 6% for the full year, driven by lower input costs and benefits from our cost savings efforts"
8157,"In Europe and Australia, organic net sales decreased 9% in the quarter and 4% for the full year"
8158,Remember that last year’s fourth quarter included an extra month of results for Yoplait Europe as we aligned that business to our fiscal calendar
8159,"Excluding the difference, organic net sales would have been up low single-digits in the quarter led by growth in Häagen-Dazs and Nature Valley"
8160,"Constant currency segment operating profit declined 26% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the fiscal year, impacted by the difference in reporting periods"
8161,"Excluding the extra period, Europe and Australia operating profit was down mid single-digits for the full year due to currency driven inflation on imported products in the UK"
8162,In our Asia and Latin America segment organic net sales grew 8% in the fourth quarter including a double digit percentage benefit from an extra month of results from Brazil as we aligned that business to our fiscal calendar
8163,Good growth in China and India was offset by the continued challenging environment in Latin America
8164,Full year organic net sales increased to 3%
8165,Segment operating profit declined $5 million in the quarter reflecting higher SG&A expense
8166,For the full year segment operating profit increased to $84 million from $69 million a year ago
8167,"Turning to the full year joint venture results on Slide 16, CPW’s fiscal ‘17 net sales grew 3% in constant currency with growth across all regions"
8168,Häagen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 8% for the full year driven by continued momentum on recent innovation
8169,"Combined after tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $85 million for the year, down $3 million versus last year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency and an asset write-off for CPW, which were partially offset by volume gains on Häagen-Dazs Japan"
8170,Constant currency after tax earnings were down $5 million
8171,We delivered on our cost saving goals for the year with cost of goods sold HMM savings totaling $390 million and aggregate savings from our previously announced projects totaling $540 million
8172,These cost savings more than offset inflation which rounded down to 1% for the full year and help to drive strong margin expansion
8173,Full year fiscal ‘17 adjusted gross margin was up 50 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 18.1% of net sales
8174,"Turning to the balance sheet, our quarterly core working capital increased 9% year-over-year as the timing of receivables and higher inventory balances were partially offset by continued progress on accounts payable"
8175,"Despite the increase in core working capital this fiscal year end, we made significant progress in reducing core working capital over the last 5 years"
8176,"Since 2012 while net sales are up mid single-digits, we have driven core working capital down by over 50%"
8177,"And importantly, we expect our receivables and inventory balances to normalize in fiscal ’18. In addition, we still see opportunities for further benefits from payables which together should drive down our core working capital this year"
8178,"Full year operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, down 12% from the year ago, driven by the higher core working capital balance, changes in income taxes payable and lower incentive trade and advertising costs"
8179,Fiscal ‘17 capital investments totaled $684 million as a result full year free cash flow was $1.6 billion or 86% of our adjusted after tax earnings
8180,Over the last 3 years our cumulative free cash flow represents 97% of adjusted after tax earnings above our 95% conversion target
8181,And we expect fiscal ’18 cash conversion to be above that 95% as well
8182,"We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in fiscal ‘17 and dividends per share were $1.92, up 8% from last year"
8183,Net share repurchases totaled $1.5 billion and we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% for the full year
8184,"Slide 20 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal ‘18, industry trends in the U.S"
8185,in the last few quarters have been challenging and we are not planning for a significant turnaround in those trends this year
8186,We expect our organic net sales trends will steadily improve from the first quarter to the second and improve again in the back half
8187,"We estimate we will deliver cost of goods sold HMM savings of approximately $390 million, which will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%"
8188,And we will generate $700 million of savings for our previously announced projects of roughly $160 million above fiscal ‘17 levels
8189,Turning on Slide 21 you can see a summary of our fiscal 2018 guidance
8190,We expect organic net sales to decline between 1% and 2%
8191,We plan to increase media investment for the year
8192,We project total segment operating profits to be in the range between flat and up 1% on a constant currency basis
8193,"As Jeff mentioned upfront, we plan to expand our adjusted operating profit margin in fiscal ‘18. We expect both interest expense and our adjusted tax rate to be in line with fiscal ‘17 levels"
8194,We are targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding
8195,We expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be up between 1% and 2% in constant currency with EPS down in the first half reflecting lower sales and the phasing of our cost savings initiatives and brand investments
8196,EPS will be up in the second half as sales trends improve
8197,"We estimate foreign currency will be $0.01 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. And finally as I mentioned earlier, we are targeting to convert more than 95% of our adjusted after tax earnings to free cash flow this year"
8198,"Now, I will turn over to Jeff to provide more color on our fiscal ‘18 plans"
8199,"So, Andrew, as we have talked about in the call, there is several things contributing to profit improvement next year, HMM at $390 million will exceed our inflation, even though inflation will be elevated in F ‘18 versus F ‘17 and 3%"
8200,And we have another $160 million in cost savings – incremental cost savings coming through
8201,"In addition, while our price mix will be less of a contributor in ‘18 than in ‘17 it will still be a positive contributor"
8202,"So, we have those three positives"
8203,It will be offset by volume declines still in the year and that will be particularly felt in the early part of the year
8204,"In Q1, for example, we expect our organic sales to closely near what we saw in ‘17, for example"
8205,And then we will see investments
8206,An investment will span a number of areas
8207,We have talked about media being up and that will certainly be one
8208,"But we are also investing in things like taking Yoplait to more cities in China to expanding our Häagen-Dazs stick bar business, geographic expansion in Europe, building capabilities like e-commerce and SRM and getting started on our process transformation work"
8209,"And these will show up – they won’t all show up in media and I want to make that clear, while media will be up, many of these investments will be seen in COGS or in SG&A, but that will be – that is embedded in the guidance"
8210,"And then as you mentioned, incentive, which I think next year is going to be about $45 million to $50 million drag"
8211,"So, the combination of those things allows us to be comfortable with the flat to plus 1 SOP"
8212,"The EPS will expand a bit more, because it will benefit from the share reduction of 1% or 2%"
8213,And that’s really the biggest driver between SOP growth and EPS growth next year
8214,"And the other thing that I would add David is that there is momentum we have take into consideration and as you saw F ‘17 unfold, we saw some negative momentum in Q2 and Q3, we began turning that in Q4, but it doesn’t turn overnight and so we will continue to see that momentum improve as year unfolds that’s why I indicated earlier Q1 we don’t expect to see a lot better performance than in Q4, but we expect Q2 to be better and the second half to be better still"
8215,So our expectation is that we exit F ‘18 on much better footing than we are today and certainly that will help us get to that guidance
8216,"Jason, I appreciate the positive comments on our pricing as we said we got a little ahead of ourselves in some cases and hurt on the volume side"
8217,"But we are pleased that we need to get the pricing in place it was an important contributor this year being ‘17. I won’t bring up precisely the price and mix, but one other things that you see in the pricing is that as we did less merchandising and we had more base line it was a positive mix from that standpoint and it’s also positive mix from a product and category standpoint that helped as the year unfolded"
8218,"Looking forward, we still expect to see price mix benefit in F ‘17 – it’s F ‘18. Thank you, Jeff"
8219,"As I said for the total company it would be less than in ‘17 and it’s really driven by North America and we expect it to be positive, but lower and as Jeff alluded to it’s really about getting in the right zone on some key brands and particularly Pillsbury and Progresso"
8220,"But we expect the other segments actually to be up on price mix in F ‘18. Our Convenience and Foodservice business will see a stronger bakery flour pricing as that recovers, we are going to be pricing for some higher inflation which includes the Brexit impact in the UK and higher dairy inflation and obviously in Asia and Lat-Am have a lot of the emerging market inflation that comes through us in pricing"
8221,So we expect price mix to still be a contributor in ‘18 albeit at a slightly lower level than we saw in ‘17.
8222,"Bryan, I think you should think about – I think as we think about our investment in you have Jason and I think you are referring to media, but we would say more broadly is we expect our investment behind our brands to go ahead of our sales levels"
8223,And you are seeing that in F‘18 and I think it is more or less for ‘19 and ‘20 you should assume the same
8224,"Well, Chris, I am not going to, I guess, quantify it for you, but again as I listed to Andrew’s question, we have some margin improvement pluses coming through in HMM over inflation in the cost projects and in price mix and even offsetting some of that with volume declines, I mean, there is still a pretty significant gap between that and the earnings expectations we have for the year and that gap is really filled by the investments that we expect to be making"
8225,"Having grown up in New England, I want to start by saying congratulation to the Super Bowl 51 Champion New England Patriots"
8226,They set some records last night and we're setting some records ourselves here today
8227,"On my first earnings call as President and CEO, I'm thrilled to share great results that Tyson Foods family delivered in the first quarter of fiscal year in 2017. It's an incredibly exciting time at Tyson as we position ourselves for the next stage of growth and I'm looking forward to leading our team as we seek to improve the value of our company for all of our stakeholders"
8228,"Let's talk about our Q1, which is the best quarter in the company's history with record earnings, operating income and cash flows"
8229,Return on sales was in or above the normalized range for each of our segments and total company operating margin was a record 10.7%
8230,"In the first quarter, we capitalized on favorable market conditions in our Beef and Pork segments and the cash generated is providing fuel for growth in our value-added Chicken and Prepared Foods segments"
8231,"As we outlined in our year-end 2016 call, our earnings were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by $35 million in mark-to-market and lower cost-to-market accounting treatments"
8232,This benefited our Q1 results as we started getting this back
8233,"Synergies for the quarter were $161 million, with $40 million incremental to the Q1 of 2016. Total synergies to-date are $620 million"
8234,And now for an update on our operating results which illustrates the advantage of our balanced portfolio with strong performances across the board
8235,We'll start with Fresh Meats
8236,"In the Beef segment, our operating income was a record $299 million, with a record operating margin of 8.5%"
8237,"Volume was up 4.5%, while average price was down 6.6% reflecting the lower cut-out"
8238,Plentiful cattle supplies and lower consumer pricing that stimulated both domestic and export demand contributed to the record results
8239,"Our Beef business has been challenged in the past few weeks with typical seasonality, however with cattle supplies expected to increase 3% to 4%, the remainder of the year should be very strong"
8240,"At this point, we're estimating Beef segments operating margin for the year to be around 5%"
8241,"The Pork segments operating income for Q1 was a record $247 million, with a record 19.7% operating margin"
8242,"Volume was up 4.3%, while average price was down 1%"
8243,Demand was strong and especially in the export markets
8244,"The USDA recently issued a report stating that China will likely remain a large importer of pork given its rising production costs, constraints on land use, and stricter environmental regulations"
8245,"While Tyson Foods doesn't export a significant amount of pork to China, other U.S"
8246,"packers do, which creates domestic disappearance"
8247,"We're certainly aware of the additional capacity coming online, but there appears to be enough hog production to support these plants, and continuing export demand should absorb the additional supply"
8248,"At this point, we don't know how any changes in the U.S"
8249,"trade policy might affect exports of pork or other proteins, but in general, trade restrictions that impact export demand also can affect domestic supply"
8250,We're planning for different scenarios and will be prepared to adapt if there's any change in policy
8251,Now turning to our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments
8252,"In our Chicken segment, our first quarter operating income was $263 million, with a 9.7% operating margin"
8253,Average price was up 1.4% and volume was up 1.3%
8254,"Value-added volume was up 5%, while commodity volume declined, demonstrating that we're growing where we want to grow with products carrying higher, more stable margins"
8255,Sales price was up due to these mixed changes offsetting general market declines
8256,Costs increased in part due to additional mass spending to support growth in the Tyson brand
8257,We expect more pricing pressure from competing proteins for chicken while our feed costs are projected to be flat with last year
8258,"With our predominantly value-added mix, the Chicken segment should be in the upper end of its normalized range of 9% to 11% return on sales for the year"
8259,"In our Prepared Foods segment, operating income in the first quarter was $190 million with a 10% operating margin"
8260,"Average price was down 2.9%, reflecting lower raw material costs passed through to customers, volume increased to 2.9% offsetting lower pricing"
8261,"Synergies within the Prepared Foods segment were $127 million for the quarter, with $32 million incremental to Q1 of 2016. As a reminder, not all of the synergies flow to the bottom line as we invest in the long-term health of the business"
8262,"For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect flat input costs, but we also expect a more competitive pricing environment given overall protein availability"
8263,"Something very important to me, in seeing our company along its path to achieving its fullest growth potential is investing in our facilities to support that growth"
8264,"As such, I want to make you aware of an important investment initiative we've undertaken that will affect the Prepared Foods segment for approximately 18 months"
8265,"Within Prepared Foods, we have two well-developed businesses in both retail and food service channels"
8266,These channels are complementary in reaching all consumers
8267,Our scale in both channels provides a natural volume hedge as consumer eating behavior shifts between channels
8268,This leadership position is increasingly critical as channels blur chasing rapidly growing convenience and on-the-go occasions as exemplified by the rise of e-commerce meal kits
8269,Our retail channel consists of primarily category-defining branded products and is propelled by industry-leading marketing capabilities as well as a well-supported asset base
8270,It has gross margins as robust as any in the industry and growth rates that lead the industry
8271,The food service channel is also characterized by industry-leading share positions across more than 10 categories
8272,"In contrast to retail, in food service, we play in primarily unbranded price-driven categories that are highly competitive and can be volatile as they absorb swings in commodity"
8273,"These category and channel positions are strategically important for long-term growth, but generally operate at margins below those realized by our retail brands"
8274,Network investments to upgrade capacity and throughput for long-term growth have increased the cost structure in our plants that serve the food service channel and further pressured margins
8275,"As the capacity investments translate into improved efficiency and volume growth over the next 18 months, these pressures will abate, but in the interim they will continue to compress margins possibly dropping the segment below 10% return on sales for the year and around 9% for the second quarter"
8276,Let's now turn to a view on total company growth
8277,Our sales volume across all segments rolled up to 2.4% growth
8278,Our retail channel showed the most volume growth in the company versus Q1 last year with a 6.6% increase
8279,"IRI data for the 13-week period corresponding with our Q1 showed Tyson Foods, both Core 9 and all Tyson products sold at retail, were leading sales volume and sales dollar growth among retail food manufacturers"
8280,"As you'll see in the slides posted on our website this morning, we were only – we were, of the top 10 branded food-only companies, the only one with positive sales volume and one of only two companies with positive sales dollar growth"
8281,"For the most recent 13-week period, IRI reported total Tyson retail volume was up 6%"
8282,Core 9 volume was also up 6% with 1.2 points of share gain
8283,"Despite the deflationary pricing environment, dollar sales were up 2% for total Tyson and 3% in the Core 9. Our retail branded business experienced continued strong growth in the quarter behind base business momentum, excellent retail execution around the holidays and new product launches"
8284,"The Hillshire Farm brand drove growth across smoked sausage, lunchmeat and cocktail links categories"
8285,"Jimmy Dean's Stuffed Hash Browns, Jimmy Dean Delights Frittatas, Hillshire Snacking, and Tyson Premium Select Nuggets are examples of innovations that are meeting or exceeding our expectations"
8286,We continued improving ROI on our advertising spend behind new campaigns utilizing more precise media buying and effective advertising execution
8287,"I should note, we're about to start lapping some more difficult comparisons in the next few months, our growth however should still outpace the industry"
8288,"In our food service channel, Q1 volume was flat to slightly up in an environment of three consecutive quarters of declining food service traffic as consumers moved towards retail channels"
8289,Our segmentation strategy and advantaged customer positions mean a large share of our volume is in accounts where their sales are outperforming industry traffic trends
8290,This can be seen in the performance of some critical food service categories and will set us up well for long-term growth
8291,"On our Q4 call, we introduced new analytics to give you some insight into our broad line distribution portion of our food service channel, which serves predominantly local and regional food service operators"
8292,"These analytics, based on NPD Supply Track data follow five critical broad line categories prioritized for growth"
8293,"These categories are value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, bacon and pizza toppings"
8294,"Like our Core 9 or retail, these are key indicators of the overall health of our protein businesses within food service distribution"
8295,"Our Focus 5 categories grew volumes 12% in October, the most recent data available"
8296,"With more work to do, we are pleased with our progress in the Focus 5. In our earnings call in November, we talked about the investments we're making in innovation, consumer insights and brands"
8297,"At our CAGNY Presentation on February 21, we'll do a deep dive on those efforts and share with you examples of our innovation pipeline"
8298,The opportunities we see for long-term growth and how we're inventing new solutions to meet the evolving needs of consumers and customers are exciting
8299,"Another investment we have made for the long-term health of our company is in our people, and I want to provide some insight on what this means and the scope"
8300,"As a part of the integration of Hillshire brands, we standardized the holiday and vacation policies across the company and transitioned to a singular competitive compensation structure"
8301,This incremental expense of $58 million in Q1 impacted Chicken by $23 million and Prepared Foods by $22 million
8302,The investment is front-loaded in our fiscal year with a lesser impact later in the year and was not adjusted out of our reported earnings
8303,"While it is a significant amount of money, it's imperative to invest in our team members for long-term growth and stability"
8304,We want to keep Tyson Foods as a preferred place to work with a compensation package that attracts and retains the best people in the industry
8305,"We're investing where it matters, while heightening our focus on lean and continuous improvement to provide fuel for these investments"
8306,We are becoming more disciplined at driving out non-value-added costs across the company to focus our precious resources on growth
8307,There will be significant dollars attached to those cost savings and I plan to be more descriptive about this in the future
8308,"So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis to walk you through our financial results"
8309,Good morning
8310,"Let me talk about growth overall, then we can talk about sort of EPS over time"
8311,"You know, yes, we are going to – we will be making investments for the future of the company in terms of growth, but we are also going to deliver growth in 2017. So, you know, it's key, it's our quarter (21:13) – our fiber, it's our story"
8312,We are consistent
8313,We want sustainable growth
8314,That's our objective
8315,And I'll say a few things
8316,"One, you know, we continue to invest where we want to grow and we're demonstrating growth on value-added products versus the commodity elements of our portfolio, and I'd say that's particularly in Chicken and Prepared Foods we see that very prominently"
8317,"Beef and Pork are also benefiting from livestock supply and very strong markets, but I would say, Chicken and Prepared Foods is where you'll find us investing heavily"
8318,Prepared Foods is in a fantastic position to take advantage of innovation and brand strength
8319,"We've seen the results of the innovation coming through volume, and we are prepared at CAGNY to show you some pretty fantastic progress we've made on our innovation pipeline"
8320,"So as it relates to, Heather, the EPS growth expectations, you know, the range that we're guiding to now puts us in the 12% to 15% for this year"
8321,"Ongoing, that's, you know, where we've talked about continuing to guide as a high single digits EPS growth, and you know, I'll turn it over to Dennis for anything else you want to add there"
8322,Correct
8323,"Without giving you specific guidance for 2018, I mean that's too far away for us, what I'd say is we're making the right investments for growth"
8324,"If you think about the Prepared Foods business, it's really, like I said, two separate businesses"
8325,"Predominantly in the legacy Tyson organization, it was a food service business and in the legacy Hillshire business, it was about 75% retail, 25% food service"
8326,The margin profiles are very different in those businesses
8327,The assets were in different condition
8328,"And, so going forward, we want the mix to turn out to be as profitable growth – continuing profitable growth within the 10% to 12% range"
8329,"However, we have some work to do as it relates to supporting those assets that serve the food service business"
8330,"Growth, we feel really strong about in the long-term, and like I said, we'll talk more about that at CAGNY"
8331,"Ken, if we deliver low double-digits, that's going to be awesome"
8332,"But we're focused on high single-digits, because for us, we believe to continue the growth algorithm of this company, we have to invest"
8333,We're going to simultaneously invest
8334,We're going to also amp up our continuous improvement program as I talked about
8335,"That feels like the right place for us to continue to drive growth, Dennis"
8336,"Yeah, no, I got it, great question"
8337,"We're constantly paranoid about avian influenza, because it's certainly is something that can wreak havoc on our company"
8338,"What I'd say is, 2015, we amped up our bio-security"
8339,"We had good bio-security to begin with, but we amped it up to an all-time high level of discipline and scrutiny, frankly, and it hasn't stopped"
8340,"And so, that we feel confident about our position, and right now it appears to be, as you called out, a non-U.S"
8341,"issue, but certainly we remain diligent in our efforts to make sure Tyson is protected"
8342,"Yeah, really it's too small an issue at this point"
8343,"Yeah, you're welcome"
8344,Good morning
8345,Agreed
8346,"Yeah, so, Jeremy, as we talked about synergies, the one thing we need to come back to is those numbers that we have continue to talk about, those are gross numbers and there's a lot of expenses beneath that that, you know, net out to a smaller number, and there's a significant amount of investment that we are making in the cost base for sure"
8347,"The way I'd have you think about it is that, yes, predominantly those have gone to make it more attractive margin in the business, but that's something that will continue on"
8348,"So as we stop the sort of synergy discussion, we're going to continue to talk about lean and continuous improvement, that's going to, you know, provide the fuel for growth for the business"
8349,"Over time, we expect margin expansion"
8350,We talked about 10% being the number that we're comfortable with right now
8351,But you should expect margin to expand toward the higher end of that range and continue to experience greater than industry growth
8352,Yeah
8353,"It will be, you know, our guidance is in that upper-end of the normalized range, 9% to 11%"
8354,"We expect it to be growing in both, you know, Frozen and Fresh segments"
8355,"What I'd say is, you know, we're taking advantage of the low cost of raw materials right now and we've added cooking capacity, which is – we don't talk about that a lot, but that is something that we have made tremendous progress on, as we've added capacity, we've sold that capacity and so we're in a position where we're, you know, looking to add more capacity"
8356,So the mix is improving
8357,"We're focused on reducing the cost structure as you call out, but we continue to see that we're doing the right things in that business, and outside of a massive grain shock, we feel like we're in a great, great position"
8358,"Yeah, sure"
8359,"You know, pricing is competitive"
8360,"There's a lot of protein available, so pricing is a big effect, Adam"
8361,"And, you know, that's not going to abate in the near term, and we see that being an issue that's hanging with us"
8362,"We also see, as we've discussed, some of those costs rolling through"
8363,"Now, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's mostly the one-time nature that has rolled through, but that is something that we are investing in to make sure that the margin holds up over time"
8364,But I'd say the biggest thing that we're facing right now is just pricing as it relates to overall availability
8365,Yeah
8366,Q2 is always a tough quarter for us to understand exactly how it's going to play out given the seasonality of our business
8367,But I would say it's not just on the Fresh Meat side that there's tremendous seasonality as it relates to the poultry and Prepared Foods side as well
8368,So we feel like Q2 will be challenged and we think Q3 and Q4 will be strong
8369,"Now, we're guiding to what we believe, based on what we know today, those are the numbers we feel confident about and we'll see how it plays out, but it's a lot depends on how Q2 rolls"
8370,After
8371,You're welcome
8372,"Yeah, I'm going to – I'll tackle the first one, and Dennis could probably provide some color on the second part of that, Rob"
8373,"You know, the difference between last year and this year is just the pricing for us that we're into the marketplace with"
8374,"I mean, it's what we're focused on as we talked repeatedly is about making sure that we're continuing to put ourselves in a position where we're growing volume"
8375,"So, think about that value-added growth of 5% that comes making sure that we're entirely competitive, so that is the reason why, year over-year, you're not seeing the same margin structure, but you're seeing the maintained growth"
8376,"Dennis, do you want to comment on that?"
8377,Absolutely
8378,"Yeah, pricing pressure, think about Prepared Foods, our portfolio, it is predominantly protein and it plays in the same space, same dynamics, so absolutely we have been more aggressive for sure"
8379,Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
8380,You're welcome
8381,"Sure, Akshay"
8382,The way to think about it is we have to come to one system across Tyson Foods which is not a unusual thing for companies to make sure that they're doing that in a thoughtful way
8383,"As we did it, we said that the right thing to do was to get to a point where we have compelling packages for our team across the organization"
8384,"For the year, we expect it's going to be about $100 million in total charges"
8385,"The $58 million that hit Q1, I spoke about, about 80% of that is one-time in nature, and the costs for the rest of the year, they flow through"
8386,But I would say that the recurring cost structure increase is less than the accounting true-up for the first quarter and it does make a lot of sense for us to focus on making sure that we have a one-Tyson system as it relates to compensation
8387,"No, it was getting to one system on holidays and vacations and because we were so different across both, that was the key issue"
8388,"Yeah, and I think it's fair to say that the business has always been on the, as you call it, on the legacy Tyson side, it's been a challenging business from a margin perspective"
8389,"If we look at the 2014 results, it was a loss maker"
8390,"2013, it was about 3%"
8391,"I think the 5.5 % was one-time that was, I believe, 2012. But if you look at the business year-over-year for the legacy Tyson team, it was a business that was challenged from a margin perspective"
8392,"So when you're flowing through with the addition of Hillshire, there are some – the blend-out is going to be somewhat less"
8393,"As it relates to your question about the investing in the business, yes, we have continued to invest and part of that or I would say the majority of that, as it relates to synergies, have been closing some plants that were non-strategic as we consolidated volume into existing plants that we're heavily investing in"
8394,That sometimes goes really well
8395,Sometimes it wasn't executed exactly as we had drawn up on the white board
8396,"However, what I would say is, the investments that we're making now are pointed towards growing the business and improving the margins"
8397,"And so, that's as clear as I could put it, Akshay"
8398,Yeah
8399,"So the – we're just getting the number, the percentage of the top of my head, I don't know what that is"
8400,"You can maybe follow-up with that, Jon, to the extent that we're going to share it"
8401,"What I would say is, we are making tremendous impact on our business in food service on poultry"
8402,"So our Prepared or further processed business in poultry is going extremely well in food service, and we are making sure that those categories we want to play long-term are going to be healthy"
8403,"Now, where that growth is going to be sourced from, there's a lot of channel shifting as I talked about"
8404,"But if you think about the periphery of the grocery store, our customers are looking for solutions that are not necessarily retail packaged brands, but they are ready to consume"
8405,You might have heard this term gross around
8406,"There's a lot of – our customers that are looking to capture food service volume, we are in the sweet spot of that space, because our solutions are exactly what they're looking for and our expertise is what they want to leverage"
8407,"So, I'll say, and thinking growth for the future, food service will come from the traditional channels that it does, that you know of, but I also would ask you to think about that periphery of the store being a real sweet spot for us"
8408,Good morning
8409,"Yes, yes, it is"
8410,"That is going to be a part of what's going to continue to hang with us here, but we wanted to make an improvement in our network"
8411,We went down that path
8412,"We made a good decision to close a plant that was not fit for the business, but the production was transferred to the newer facilities"
8413,"It was absolutely the right decision to position us for growth, and we just have more work to do"
8414,"The transition wasn't seamless, like I said, but we feel like that we're on path to make that a long-term healthy strong business for us, both in terms of Prepared Foods growth and also the margin structure"
8415,"Yeah, so Farha, I won't give you the forward-looking marketing investments, but what I will tell you is we are doing two things that you should hold us accountable to"
8416,One is making sure that that investment continues to improve its return
8417,So we are doing some fabulous work on our team to make sure ROI continues to go up on marketing investments
8418,"And so if the ROI is increasing and we're making the right moves in supporting our branded businesses, we would expect the overall to continue to go up"
8419,"So, if we're getting a good return on that, we want to support the brands, and you know, it depends on which brand you're talking about, what the ultimate level is, the mix-out is going to be different depending upon what kind of traction we've got"
8420,"Clearly, we're going to spending and have spent a lot more on the Tyson brands and we're going to continue to spend on the other brands that we have the number one position"
8421,"So it's what's required, certainly our customers expect that"
8422,"And like I said, we're going to get nice returns on those investments"
8423,Okay
8424,Let me take that as a follow-up
8425,We'll talk to Jon to see if we can get you some more detail around that that we're willing to share
8426,And I mean part of it we feel like we have a competitive advantage in that area and want to make sure we thread that needle correctly
8427,"But I would ask Jon to follow up with you, Farah"
8428,"Yeah, awesome"
8429,"So, you know, I really thought we'd be going out of limb talking about 2018. What we see are, you know, certainly in the regions where we are – we'd like how it's shaping up"
8430,"2017 looks to have better numbers, let's say, cattle in our regions, which is great"
8431,"Our cattle inventory, we feel like – if you look at it compared to 2011 and 2012, this year, it's similar – its improving to that level"
8432,"And, you know, we feel like for our position going into 2018, it's teeing up well, but it's just too far out there to know"
8433,"You know, 2018 cattle are born in 2016, and we're kind of, you know, trying to model that ourselves"
8434,"But we feel great about 2018. I can't give you a view, I'm sorry"
8435,"I'll just go back and say, 2017 looks better than last year, and the Midwest, more cattle coming"
8436,We like that
8437,"We believed for the year we're at 5%, just the level that we're feeling like we'll wind up at"
8438,"And it's hard to tell, but I would say, we're shaping up well"
8439,You're welcome
8440,No
8441,"So, as I've said before, the Georgia Dock for Tyson Foods is a tempest in a teapot"
8442,It's really not something that drives a lot of our attention
8443,"Since the elimination of the mechanism last month, customers that are affected are being switched to other methods, so no impact on margin"
8444,We've told you that in the past we have various pricing mechanisms
8445,"It's really supply and demand that our customers are looking at, what's the overall protein availability, how do they feel like they have leverage"
8446,"Certainly, as we're continuing to grow the branded business more of that is on a list price"
8447,"We have certainly some businesses that are formula driven, but predominantly on grains, so that's what I'd ask you to think about"
8448,"And the diversity of those pricing mechanisms for us tells us it's important for us, because it helps us de-risk the total margin profile"
8449,"But as it relates to the Georgia Dock, no impact"
8450,You're welcome
8451,"Absolutely, we will continue to flex our buy versus grow strategy"
8452,We try to grow whole-bird increments to remind everybody and we buy pieces
8453,"So the parts that we need we're going to continue to buy on the market when the market is favorable, but that's our model"
8454,And that's what we feel really strong about to continue our growth is to make sure that we're making sure what we're producing internally is in whole-bird increments
8455,"About 80% of the $58 million, so let's just round it up to about $50 million"
8456,"Ken, the 2017, whatever we have teed up to invest in 2017 is in our guidance, it's in the capital plan"
8457,"This is, you know, we've been working on this for some time"
8458,"As it relates to rolling forward beyond 2017, simultaneously, we're amping up our continuous improvement program"
8459,"So investments that we're going to make in the business, we know that there needs to be a paid for (51:24)"
8460,"So that is what we intend to do, so it's not going to be incremental"
8461,I would ask you to think about it as it's going to be offset by continued improvement in our continuous improvement efforts and discipline
8462,So that's how I think about it
8463,I will have Jon follow-up with you
8464,We can do the math together and
8465,"2017 is continuing to be a number where – we are going to grow in 2017 and we believe that, of course, it's going to be a base for us to grow into the future"
8466,"But, you know, that's not – we want to make sure that we are continuing to grow while we're investing, that's a trick, and that's what we want to do for, you know, all of our stakeholders, make sure we're doing that really, really well"
8467,Absolutely
8468,"Yeah, I'd say, Heather, it's not the cuts so much as it is the businesses that, I'd say, apply to"
8469,"So if you think about the retail business, it operates in a typical CPG model, where we are looking at supply/demand, the strength of the brands, elasticities to make the right calls on what's the best thing for us to do as it relates to pricing"
8470,"The food service, the raw material, generally flows through on a formula price"
8471,"There's always – we're looking to make sure that we have the right balance, but it's slower"
8472,There's a almost – about 70% of the raw material gets passed on
8473,"But those funds will continue to – that we – when we capture – certainly, margin momentum are going to be continuing to be focused on innovation"
8474,The particular cuts isn't so much how we think about it
8475,"Now, with the exception of bellies"
8476,"Of course, bellies has been a particularly volatile raw material right now and that's something that we continue to make sure that we're doing the right thing for, the right brand, as well as our Jimmy Dean brand business"
8477,And that's probably the area that gets the most attention right now
8478,The rest of the commodity inputs or cost inputs are something that is – we feel like we've got a pretty good handle on
8479,Bellies are domestic
8480,"Hams, I think, as it relates to another, probably volatile, component, are export predominantly"
8481,"So the rest of the trim and those items that we buy for retail and food service, food service moves typically on a formula, retail does not"
8482,There's generally a lag effect up and down
8483,Absolutely
8484,You're welcome
8485,Great
8486,Thanks for all the wonderful questions
8487,"Appreciate all those, and before I sign off I just wanted to say we had, of course, an excellent overall financial performance in Q1 we're thrilled by, and as a team we're continuing to raise the bar for ourselves"
8488,We have a tremendous amount of excitement about the future; precisely because we know we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of room for growth
8489,We've got great capabilities
8490,We play in great categories
8491,We have a great team that knows how to win
8492,"And as you think about our business, just know that we're always thinking about value creation; it's on our minds every day"
8493,"Creating shared value for all of our stakeholders, our investors and everybody in the team and it's through hard work and determination we'll get it done"
8494,"So, just thanks again"
8495,Appreciate your interest in Tyson Foods and we're looking forward to growing together
8496,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's second quarter conference call"
8497,I'm delighted to be here speaking with you leading my first earnings call as Coty's CEO
8498,"Let me take a moment to reiterate for you Coty's ambition, as previously articulated by Bart, which I embrace and will continue to use as the foundation of my strategic vision"
8499,"Our ambition in beauty is to strive to become over time a global industry leader by being a clear challenger in beauty, delighting our consumers, which ultimately should translate into revenue growth, strong cash flow and the creation of long-term shareholder value"
8500,"Having completed my first four months in the role, it's clear to me that the combination of our iconic and emerging brands, energized employees and the comprehensive strategy we are laying out for the new organization, will position us well to reach our ambition"
8501,"Today is our first time reporting as a combined company following the closing of the P&G Beauty transaction October 1. Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter"
8502,"The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market, on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division, and the distraction associated with the integration efforts"
8503,"I want to be clear that while the complexity of the merger, the sheer magnitude of this integration and simultaneous reorganization of our total company have impacted our organization and our short-term results, I have initiated additional changes as I'm not satisfied with the underlying performance of several parts of the business"
8504,"So although fiscal 2017 is a transitional year, as previously discussed, we have already started to tackle the growth challenges of our business"
8505,"As it is my first earnings call and an introduction to how I think about the business, I wanted to go in much more detail into the trends and strategies that I plan going forward"
8506,"To reiterate my assessment from the last earnings call, the Coty business is composed of three divisions in different states of evolution"
8507,"The Professional Beauty division is performing well overall, fueled by the continued success of the hair portfolio"
8508,The Luxury division has been improving its revenue trends in parallel with decreasing wholesale distribution to create a healthy business
8509,And we expect the momentum to continue in the coming quarters
8510,"However, the Consumer Beauty division is facing a number of challenges, and I'll come back to Consumer Beauty in more detail later"
8511,I will now discuss my strategic vision for the company and the specific actions we are implementing to continue the reshaping of our business in order to address the current challenges and return the combined company to growth
8512,"First and foremost, we have an amazing portfolio of iconic brands that are loved by millions of consumers throughout the world, including COVERGIRL, Rimmel and Clairol in Consumer Beauty; Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and Gucci in Luxury; and Wella and OPI in Professional Beauty"
8513,"Our first focus on our established global brands is to continue to strengthen and nurture them, particularly as some of them were previously essentially orphaned within a larger corporation"
8514,Our second focus is to cultivating (05:03) few of the brands with higher growth potential in our portfolio
8515,"Our third focus is to stabilize the remaining brands, whether through active portfolio rationalization or other majors"
8516,"Finally, we're also completing the shaping of our new organization, including making sure we have the right talent in key roles to drive growth in our brands"
8517,We aim to achieve these objectives through four key pillars
8518,"First, we are repositioning some of the brands in order to reconnect these brands with consumers, building on their already strong brand equity"
8519,"Second, we are making significant changes to our innovation and product development process in parts of the organization"
8520,"Third, we are accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation, including e-commerce"
8521,"And fourth, we are working to significantly ramp our in-store execution"
8522,"I would like to also highlight that we see a substantial opportunity to use the strength of our growth portfolio brands to reach more and more consumers all over the world, as many of our brands still have substantial opportunity for geographical expansion leveraging our global distribution footprint"
8523,"On the M&A front, we're continuing to strengthen the Coty portfolio through highly strategic acquisitions and planned portfolio rationalization"
8524,"Both ghd and Younique are expected to be accretive in year one, on both net revenue growth and adjusted earnings"
8525,"From a strategic perspective, ghd expands our assortment of premium products for the Salon channel, while the partnership with Younique leverages unique high-growth e-commerce platform and social selling direct-to-consumer business model"
8526,"On the portfolio rationalization, we have identified the non-core portfolio brands and are now exploring potential alternatives for these brands, including divestitures"
8527,So the comprehensive reshaping of our business for growth is continuing at pace
8528,I would now like to take some time to discuss each of Coty's new divisions and the specific action we are implementing to address current challenges and return the combined company to growth
8529,I'll start with Consumer Beauty
8530,"This division represents approximately half of our combined portfolio in our revenues with around half of the division sales concentrated in color cosmetics, and the other half composed of retail hair, body care and mass fragrances"
8531,"The Q2 results of the Consumer Beauty division were clearly disappointing, as I mentioned before"
8532,"The main drivers behind these results are the fact that some of the key brands were orphaned in the previous large organization, the high competitive market pressure, and the changing market environment"
8533,"Additionally, we're still working through highly elevated (08:08) trade inventories that were built before the close of the P&G Beauty transaction"
8534,"So let me go a little deeper into each of these categories, starting with color cosmetics"
8535,The color cosmetics category has been growing at an average at a low-single digit pace in key regions
8536,"But the category has been rapidly changing with consumers' focus much more on trends in ancillary products, and engaging much more online to discuss and determine what they purchase"
8537,A lot of the growth has come from entry (08:44) and smaller brands that are fast to respond to trends and engage with their customers through digital platforms and innovative in-store activation
8538,"We are behind on this curve, but we have already taken action and we are working on a multi-pronged approach"
8539,"First, we are revamping our product development, as well as our communication process and programs"
8540,"Aided by our own digital agency, Beamly, as well as more strategic partnership with our key partner suppliers, the new innovation process is focused on spotting the trends early and slashing our average time to market, which is currently about 12, 18 months"
8541,"In parallel, we are working to digitally transform our brands and overall our in-store presence to make sure we're present the best way possible where our consumers shop"
8542,"As part of these efforts, we will be shifting more money from traditional media to digital media and investment in the store"
8543,"Finally, we are also working with retailers to improve our partnership relationship, bringing value to them and their customers"
8544,"From a brand perspective, we believe we have a strong portfolio of cosmetic brands, but we'll be re-launching several of them to regain relevance with consumers"
8545,"Specifically, we will be re-launching COVERGIRL and Max Factor in the coming fiscal year, with new brand positioning, new creations, new packaging and new in-store appearance"
8546,We will also be announcing Sally Hansen's market approach to build a stronger emotional connection with the consumer
8547,"While the full COVERGIRL and Max Factor brand re-launches will kick off in few quarters, we're already seeing some bright spots in the business"
8548,COVERGIRL So Lashy! launch is the biggest mascara launch of the season
8549,"The innovative (10:35) product, strong consumer insight and the disruptive marketing campaign featuring James Charles and Nura Afia have driven disproportion engagement and above expected results for this novel mascara that works for all lash types"
8550,"This multi-pronged approach will take time to yield results, but we strongly believe this is the right way to strengthen our business for the long term"
8551,"Turning to retail hair, we believe that Coty has a real opportunity to revive the category through innovation, stronger in-store execution and consumer engagement"
8552,"The category has been dormant for the last 10 years, particularly in developed countries"
8553,"We believe the biggest players in the category, including Clairol, have been leveraging the category for profit with no real innovation"
8554,Our analysis indicates that consumers are intimidated by the difficulty of the shopping for hair color in stores and the complexity of the hair coloring process at home
8555,"In turn, the category penetration has been going down, as consumers would rather go to their professional stylist"
8556,"As a result of these category issues, retailers have been progressively capping the shelf allocation, which in turn has limited the color assortment, preventing many women from finding their shade"
8557,"Against this backdrop, we believe we have an exciting pipeline of innovation in the near future that will revitalize the retail hair category and transform it into a beauty category instead of a functional category"
8558,"The Consumer Beauty division will take some time to return to growth, and I'm confident the strategic action that we are putting in place are the right steps to strengthen Coty's position in this beauty category"
8559,"Turning to the Luxury division, which accounts for approximately a third of the combined company revenues, we believe we have a very strong portfolio of brands, which span the spectrum of the prestige fragrance category from low premium to ultra-premium"
8560,And we are continuing with our strategy of making our portfolio even more prestige
8561,"Coty Luxury had strong results across several of our brands and pillars in Q2. However, the division performance in Q2 versus last year was impacted by our continued wholesale distribution reduction, which is a positive for the health of the business, and by the difficult innovation comparison versus the previous year"
8562,"On the positive side, we launched the new Hugo Boss fragrance, The Scent For Her, which marked the brand's successful entry into the female category"
8563,This was the number one launch in the UK and number two in Spain
8564,"The feedback for the new Gucci Guilty marketing campaign has also been very positive, driving market share growth in the Gucci Guilty franchise in both the U.S"
8565,and Italy
8566,"The core brand continued to grow in market across all key countries, supported by the Flora de Parfum launch"
8567,"philosophy also continued to grow in the quarter, fueled by its direct-to-consumer platform"
8568,"From a go-to-market perspective, we are continuing to gain share in the travel retail channel where we already have a disproportionate share of the fragrance category"
8569,"We evolved to successfully establish a local affiliate in China, steadily improving our distribution in in-market performance"
8570,"So, as we look to the second half of 2017, we remain excited by the robust pipeline of initiatives across the Hugo Boss, Gucci and Calvin Klein brands, amongst others"
8571,"And while there is more to do on wholesale distribution, we do expect revenue trends in the Luxury division to continue to improve in the coming quarters"
8572,"In the Professional Beauty division, which accounts for approximately a fifth of combined company revenues, we're maintaining strong momentum in the hair category, while broadening our portfolio with ghd within hair appliances and a critical adjacency in nail with OPI"
8573,"Our Salon hair portfolio continued to grow low to mid-single-digit, consistent with the performance in the two previous fiscal years, and ahead of the salon market, which is growing at approximately 1%"
8574,"We are excited by the continued strong performance over the largest brand, Wella, as well as the System Professional brand which is tapping into the premium care segment and the growing trends of customization and personalization with this EnergyCode technology"
8575,"ghd, as the new key brand of the Professional Beauty portfolio, has performed well in its first few weeks within Coty"
8576,"And we expect momentum to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, notably building on its geographical footprint expansion beyond its core countries"
8577,"All together, we expect the Professional Beauty division to see good growth on a combined company basis through the rest of the fiscal 2017 and beyond"
8578,"Following on the heels of the ghd acquisition, I'm excited about our partnership with Younique"
8579,"I'm extremely pleased that both of the founders, Derek and Melanie, will continue to lead the business, which leverages the exponential potential of online peer-to-peer social selling"
8580,"The partnership will combine Younique's high growth e-commerce platform with Coty R&D and innovation know-how, as well as extensive manufacturing supply chain capabilities"
8581,"And speaking of digitally focused investments, I would like to touch on the substantial effort that we're implementing to accelerate Coty's digital transformation"
8582,These actions span four major components
8583,"In marketing science, we are now able to understand and reach our consumers with far higher levels of targeting precision, thereby enabling a step change in our social listening and trend scanning capabilities to better keep our brand teams in markets"
8584,"In terms of brand content, we are testing creative to better align with target consumer segments and drive high and low (16:55) media effectiveness"
8585,"In media optimization, we have continued the transition to digital from 21% to over 30% globally in just this past six months, while also outperforming engagement and cost benchmarks by up to 30%, driving further media efficiency"
8586,"Looking at it as omnichannel (17:18), we will begin to create new platforms for deeper personalization, including online and new store activation programs"
8587,"With regards to the rest of fiscal 2017, we continue to expect the decline of the net revenue at constant currency to slow down in the second half, excluding the contribution from Younique and ghd"
8588,"On the P&G Beauty Business merger, the integration is progressing as expected, with no major issues to-date"
8589,"And we are reiterating our previously communicated $750 million synergy target by fiscal 2020. If I can summarize, fiscal 2017 remains a challenging transitional year, but one that we believe is setting the stage for enormous potential as a global leader and challenger in beauty"
8590,"I believe the new Coty is a much stronger company than the two previous organizations running separately, and now that we have full control of the combined brand portfolio, I'm even more confident about the great long-term potential of the new Coty"
8591,I will now turn it over to Patrice
8592,"Thanks, Steph, for the question"
8593,"Look, this is a big reorganization because both companies were not organized and structured this way prior to the merger"
8594,So we have created three divisions
8595,"Both Coty Legacy and P&G Beauty Business were not managed this way, so clearly having to manage now – having managing the company with three end-to-end division where they have full responsibility for the entire portfolio and the P&L, this is clearly a different way of working that has been embedded in the organization at the moment"
8596,"So clearly, the way of working has changed for a lot of our people, both coming from the Coty Legacy, from P&G or from the outside"
8597,"And another key element of differentiation in the structure that we had chosen is that we have end-to-end responsibility with the division, as I said, but also that the P&L sits with the countries"
8598,"And this is quite an also, I would say, significant departure from how the business was managed especially in the P&G previous business where the control of the P&L was more central, I would say"
8599,"So, I don't know if I'm answering fully your question, but in my opinion this is – I would say, are the two key elements that are making this reorganization complex, but at the same time, in my opinion, paving the way for the future success of the company"
8600,"Thanks, Bill, for the question"
8601,"Look, we believe that we have an amazing set of brands and our brands are loved by millions"
8602,"So our strategy in terms of repositioning the brands, and you mentioned COVERGIRL, it's not just the only one, is key to reconnect with the consumers"
8603,"I mentioned that I was not satisfied with some of the elements of the COVERGIRL position in the past, but actually we are now working on reinvigorating the innovation process, upgrading the packaging, the way it looks in-store, we're going to be more modern, more focused on looks"
8604,"So clearly, we have a lot in our pipeline to re-launch the brand in the future"
8605,I have to say that we've been also exposing some of our thoughts and ideas to the retailers and actually the reaction is very positive
8606,"So going back to distribution, this is a temporary situation, but we are very, very confident that all the actions that we are going to put in place will actually allow COVERGIRL to retain the position that we want to have in the market and improve"
8607,"And as a matter of fact, COVERGIRL is still the brand with the strongest equity in mass color cosmetic in the U.S"
8608,", and that gives us an enormous level of confidence for the future potential of going back to growth"
8609,"Hi, Lauren"
8610,Thanks for the question
8611,"First, the plan to re-launch COVERGIRL and Max Factor are for fiscal 2018. I think this was a part of your question"
8612,"Regarding the investment, I'm actually convinced that we have enough funds to re-launch the brands, not just these two, but also the other brands"
8613,"One thing that I would like to point out is the fact that actually the P&G brands, we're spending a substantially higher level of marketing versus what we were spending in the Coty Legacy"
8614,"So the combination of the funds that we have in the new company, around approximately 26% as a percent of net revenues, in my opinion, are actually enough or more than enough to re-launch the brands, and because there are a lot of things that we need to do are truly in terms of the way we connect with consumers"
8615,"And one of the key shift is going to be really going from traditional TV, traditional media to digital engagement"
8616,"And then as you know, moving that actually creates a lot of efficiencies, so it's not just a matter of spending more, but it's a matter of spending better and connecting better with the consumers, making sure that we speak to them in the right way where they are"
8617,"And a lot of times, they're not necessarily watching TV, but they are on different digital platforms"
8618,I believe that we're making a lot of great progress in preparing strong actions for the Luxury division to return to growth in the next few quarters
8619,We had a strong pipeline coming
8620,"Yes, in the last Christmas, we also had an unfavorable, let's say, benchmark versus the previous innovation from the past years"
8621,"So the Marc Jacobs Decadence which was a success in the previous season or the Hugo Boss The Scent For Him, which was also a big success"
8622,"But if I look at some of the elements and some of the things we've done, I'm actually quite pleased because Hugo Boss The Scent For Her, which really marks the entry of Hugo Boss in the female segment, has been a success with number one in the UK, number two in Spain"
8623,Chloe continues to do very well
8624,And we have a lot of brands which actually are performing very well in the market and outperforming the market
8625,So we're confident about the actions we're putting in place for the Luxury division
8626,"Joe, we will not quantify specifically the impact of each of them, although Patrice has mentioned the – that the overall impact has been 300 basis points on our growth in our Q2. So in terms of details, I will not be able to give it to you"
8627,What we can say is that we expect our revenues decline in the second half of 2017 to slow down
8628,"And, of course, we expect further (49:20) improvements afterwards"
8629,And it's also quite important that we look at the fact that we have three divisions
8630,And the three divisions are in a different state of evolution because Professional Beauty is actually growing and the hair portfolio is growing even faster
8631,"Last year, as I said, it's improving the trends because Q2 was already better than Q1, despite we're still tackling wholesale distribution reduction"
8632,"And we expect, of course, the business to be healthy and to continue to improve in the next few quarters"
8633,"And it will take time to really return to growth in Consumer Beauty, which is where we have the biggest challenges, as I explained before"
8634,"I don't believe this a big risk factor, and I'll explain why in a second"
8635,"I believe that now that we are the owner of the entire portfolio, we've finally been able to engage with our customers, with the retailers, in a much stronger way"
8636,I truly believe in partnership
8637,I believe partnership is when really there is a win-win situation for both parties
8638,And myself and the team are keenly focused on establishing a much stronger partnership level with the key retailers
8639,We are in the process of doing that
8640,"We are engaging with all the key retailers, U.S"
8641,but also in the other markets
8642,"And the reaction and the spirit is actually very good, because they are seeing the plans that we're putting in place"
8643,We're engaging with them
8644,"In some cases, we're working together of course in preparing these plans"
8645,"And when you approach a partnership this way, and in this case, we're also working on re-launching the very iconic brands which are loved by consumers, you know, in the respective markets"
8646,"Retailers are really appreciative of some of these plans and therefore, I see the future in a bright way, because I believe that the re-launches of the brands will bring us success in the market"
8647,"Dara, I think actually that one of the key things we could do is also to look at the investment strategy and readjust the investments among the different brands"
8648,"So there will be some brands, the one that has the higher growth potential that will receive more investment, and some others that eventually will receive a bit less"
8649,"So we are in the process of exactly doing this, and I think it's a very important financial discipline to look at also retirement investment"
8650,"Regarding on your question on spending more overall, I want to go back to my previous answer which is that when you start shifting the traditional media to digital, you actually have way more money to play with and to invest, to be able to reach more consumers"
8651,"Consumers are truly spending a disproportionate amount of time on social media, on social platforms"
8652,"And, I believe that some of our brands have not played the right role in the social engagement, and by shifting the investment actually we will achieve not only the consumers that we want to achieve, but also in the right place and the right time, and the overall connection with the brand will improve"
8653,And this is clearly part of the logic of why I answered before that we believe we have enough funds for our future success and re-launches
8654,"So first, regarding the inventory, Wendy"
8655,"So we need to put this in a bit of a perspective on the fact that we announced the acquisition of P&G in July 2015, and we closed the merger – so we closed the deal in October 2016. That's a 15-months period in which we were not able to actually work on any of the P&G brands"
8656,"We were two competing companies, and we were basically not working at all on that"
8657,"So it's a long time for brands to be announced that they would have been sold, but to still be in the hands of their previous owners"
8658,"So that clearly can cause a higher inventory, and we're not going to now detail specifically the level, but I think Patrice has explained that all the business, the transition issues, which includes a significant high inventory, were around the 300 basis points of growth"
8659,So clearly it was quantified
8660,"And in terms of distractions, clearly this is a big reorganization"
8661,"This is not just putting together two companies, because at the same time we have decided to manage the company in a divisional structure"
8662,"Now, the choice of the divisional structure in my opinion is absolutely the right choice for the future, because it does allow a level of focus and capabilities and competencies, which are dedicated to specific categories and channels"
8663,"So, fragrance and skin care in the prestige channel, in the luxury, and clearly color cosmetic and hair color and so on in the mass market, and hair and nail in professional"
8664,"So this is – the level of change is quite large and this is why it's causing the distraction because at the same time, we're in the middle of the integration of the system, which Patrice mentioned"
8665,We are not really fully performed
8666,"And Patrice, I think, mentioned the timing of the exit from the TSAs"
8667,"Regarding having all the people in the right places, we had clearly disorganization clearly meant that a lot of people had new jobs, so they had to move from different places to start the new job on October 3, and I believe that we have now a much stronger set of leaders in place"
8668,"Of course, we always look to continue to improve the bench and that's part of what we need to do to be successful in the future"
8669,"So, let me comment on that, Mark, on Younique"
8670,"I believe Younique is highly strategic, and I really believe that the online peer-to-peer social selling has a lot of potential"
8671,"And our choice is driven clearly by wanting to partner with a company that has developed a very, very successful business in this area"
8672,"And, of course, by our ambition of growing this business by also looking at geographical expansion and further category expansion"
8673,"If you think that Younique has mainly had – it's a business, a brand with the color cosmetic, I believe that this brand and in general the platform has the potential to be expanded more"
8674,And so – plus I think that e-commerce for us is a key focus for the future
8675,"And the acquisition or the partnership with Younique is a stepping stone for us to improve our capabilities, strengthen our capability in e-commerce"
8676,"Thanks, Jason, for the question"
8677,"So when we think about COVERGIRL, first of all as I mentioned before the brand, the COVERGIRL, still has the first – the number one equity in the U.S"
8678,in the mass color cosmetic
8679,I think it's quite important to remind ourself as well that we're talking about a brand which is iconic and loved by millions of consumers in the U.S
8680,"Looking at what we plan to do, first of all, we plan to build on the COVERGIRL roots"
8681,"I think, thinking about the old positioning, every woman can feel that she's a COVERGIRL"
8682,I think it's quite important that we don't completely depart from there
8683,"But we reinterpret the positioning in a much more modern way, in a more sophisticated way, so that we connect, again, and more with the consumers"
8684,"Within the re-launch, we are looking clearly at upgrading the packaging and the way we look in-store in a more modern way, in a more sophisticated way, in a way that would allow for easier navigation"
8685,"So going back to your question, it's not just a matter of spending and then choosing the right platform to connect, but it's also how we connect and how we communicate with the consumers across all the different touch points"
8686,"So I'll start with your second question, then I'll move back to the first"
8687,"So in terms of how I think and operate in terms of hiring from the outside, I believe that we always need to have a mix between internal promotion and hiring from the outside"
8688,"Whenever the capability is not present internally, it's always good to tap into the amazing talent that are out there"
8689,"At the same time, if we have the talent in the house, that's clearly very, very good"
8690,And this is different from how other companies have done it in the past because some companies just privileged promotion from the inside
8691,"Regarding your first question, which is about the mobility and the cross-fertilization across the different divisions, first of all I think we need to say that the three divisions require a level of expertise because the knowledge of the category and the channels is very important"
8692,This is why also we have decided to structure ourself with the three divisions
8693,"That being said, I also believe that people will have to move across divisions in order to fertilize on success and learnings and on capabilities"
8694,So it's going to be a mix of both in answering your first question as well
8695,"So, when in terms of mass fragrance, Linda, so the mass fragrance clearly is suffering as a category overall because of certain dynamics"
8696,"One of the key element that I think is affecting the mass fragrance is the fact that you – it's very difficult in the store environment to smell the fragrance, the juice"
8697,"So that's one of the key driver for trying the new fragrances, and that's still a key barrier there"
8698,And I think this is an issue that we in the industry all need to work together with the retailers to try to overcome this barrier
8699,"The second point is that within mass fragrance, I think we need to distinguish between celebrities and other lifestyle brands"
8700,"Within celebrities, it's fair to say that the – I would say the last brand of the celebrity brand is decreased, has decreased significantly just because the brand name and the hype behind the celebrity is now shorter"
8701,It's just that's what's happening
8702,"Now, when you look at the other side on the lifestyle brands, we have brands like Bruno Banani or adidas or Max, which are actually great brands that we plan to focus in countries like Germany, Russia"
8703,These are brands that are doing well
8704,"They are, again, iconic brands in the lifestyle mass fragrance in the specific countries"
8705,And we believe that they have potential
8706,"So again, it's a mixed sort of dynamic within the category"
8707,"Thank you, Ken"
8708,"Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call"
8709,"Today, I’ll share my perspective on our performance this quarter and outline our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year"
8710,"First, some context on the macroeconomic environment"
8711,Overall macroeconomic trends in the U.S
8712,improved slightly in the quarter
8713,Consumer confidence edged up and unemployment declined modestly
8714,"However, in the first quarter of the calendar year, consumer spending only grew 0.3%, its lowest level of growth since 2009. Consumers entered 2017 facing a variety of interrelated pressures and complexities from economic shifts, delayed tax refunds and general uncertainty"
8715,"Many consumers continued to struggle financially, especially lower income and younger shoppers"
8716,"Additionally, the retailer environment continues to be very aggressive, with e-commerce and value players applying increased pressure on grocery and mass channels and we do not anticipate this trend to abate anytime soon"
8717,Food companies certainly felt the pinch
8718,"It was a challenging quarter across the industry as top line growth remains scarce, especially in center-store categories"
8719,Consumers continue to migrate to fresher and healthier foods found on the perimeter of food stores
8720,"Like the majority of our peers, early in the calendar year, we experienced significantly lower consumption across almost all of our categories"
8721,"At Campbell, we felt it most acutely in February"
8722,"While trends improved as the quarter progressed, growth in March and April was insufficient to offset the earlier weakness"
8723,"In the context of this unfavorable operating environment, we delivered competitive results in the third quarter"
8724,"Although our top line was below our expectations, we grew or maintained market share in 11 measured categories, representing 75% of our U.S"
8725,retail dollar sales
8726,Looking at Campbell’s results
8727,"Organic sales declined 1%, adjusted EBIT declined 2%, and adjusted earnings per share declined 9% to $0.59 a share, primarily due to a higher adjusted tax rate"
8728,The sales decline in the third quarter resulted from softer than expected soup sales the ongoing capacity related challenges in Campbell Fresh refrigerated beverages and weakness in V8 beverages
8729,This more than offset the strong results from Global Biscuits and Snacks in the quarter
8730,Let’s look at our 9-month results
8731,"Year-to-date, organic sales were down 1%, adjusted EBIT was comparable to a year ago and our adjusted EPS was up 1%"
8732,"Reflecting our performance in the quarter, we revised our fiscal 2017 guidance this morning"
8733,"We lowered our sales guidance to minus 1% to 0%, a point below our previous expectations"
8734,"Despite the challenges on the top line, we have raised the low end of our adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS ranges"
8735,We now expect adjusted EBIT to increase 2% to 4% and adjusted EPS to increase 3% to 5%
8736,"We expect that we will be able to offset the impact of lower sales with our ongoing cost saving efforts, which are ahead of our expectations for the fiscal year"
8737,"Now, let me share my thoughts on our segment performance for the quarter and offer some perspective on our plans for the balance of the year"
8738,"Let’s start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages"
8739,We continued to manage this division for performance consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion
8740,"Organic sales declined by 2% in the quarter, predominantly driven by U.S"
8741,soup and V8 beverages
8742,Operating earnings were comparable to a year ago
8743,"Importantly, we continued to expand gross margin in the division, even as we made investments in real food"
8744,"As we previously outlined, we are in the process of eliminating artificial colors and flavors from our products, removing BPA from the can liners in our soup portfolio and increasing the use of real food ingredients such as chicken with no antibiotics in our soups"
8745,"Despite gaining share in the quarter, soup sales declined 4%, year-to-date, soup sales declined 1%"
8746,"Although soup performance improved throughout the quarter, we were unable to overcome the slow start in February"
8747,"Sales of condensed soup and broth declined, while our ready-to-serve portfolio grew"
8748,"Promotional activities in support of condensed soup did not generate the anticipated lift, while the decline in broth was the result of continued competitive activity from private label"
8749,"On the plus side, sales growth in our ready-to-serve portfolio was fueled by Chunky and our new Well Yes! soup line"
8750,"Chunky benefited from increased merchandising, improved marketing and new items"
8751,We remain enthusiastic about the launch of our new Well Yes! clean label soup
8752,Customer response has been strong and consumer trial is ahead of expectations
8753,"In the fourth quarter, we are planning to expand the Well Yes! line with five new varieties and to introduce a significant line extension to Chunky, new Chunky Max Bowls [ph], featuring 40% more protein"
8754,"Given our performance year-to-date and with the season being largely complete, we are now calling for soup sales to be down slightly for the year even while we gained market share"
8755,"Beyond soup, Prego continues to perform well, driven by strong consumption, increased distribution in club channels and contributions from Prego’s farmers market"
8756,V8 beverages continued to struggle as the shelf stable juice category remains challenged
8757,"As discussed last quarter, two-thirds of our shelf-stable juice portfolio, V8 100% Vegetable Juice, Veggie Blends and V8 +Energy is on trend and leverages our heritage in vegetable nutrition"
8758,The remaining third of the portfolio consisting of V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash is under pressure due in part to category wide consumer concerns about sugar
8759,"In the quarter, sales of both Fusion and Splash declined while V8 100% Vegetable Juice grew behind continued media investments"
8760,V8 +Energy also grew as we expanded distribution of new carbonated varieties
8761,"Year-to-date, the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is performing in line with its portfolio role"
8762,"While organic sales have declined 1%, operating earnings have increased 5%"
8763,"Moving on to Campbell Fresh, C-Fresh remains an important strategic business for Campbell and we are confident in the growth potential of the Packaged Fresh category as consumer preferences for fresher and healthier foods remain strong"
8764,"C-Fresh sales declined 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by continued production constraints following the June 2016 voluntary recall of Protein PLUS beverages"
8765,"As discussed during our last call, we have implemented enhanced processes to improve quality standards"
8766,"We also started up a new beverage line in Bakersfield in the quarter and are in the midst of qualifying a new co-packer, which is slated to come online late in the fourth quarter"
8767,"As expected, we still haven’t returned to our original production levels"
8768,We have been able to fill orders for shelf stock
8769,"However, we have been unable to execute normal promotional activity across the fresh beverage portfolio"
8770,We expect continued capacity constraints through the fourth quarter as we fully operationalize our new line and our co-packer starts production
8771,"We will begin increasing promotion activity towards the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and expect to ramp up to normal levels in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. On the innovation front, the reception of our new Bolthouse Farms products, including the new plant-based protein milk, has been positive by retailers"
8772,We will start shipping this exciting new product early next fiscal year
8773,Turning to our farms business
8774,Sales declined slightly driven by the natural ingredients business
8775,"We have made good progress stabilizing our carrot business, which delivered modest sales growth in the quarter as our quality and customer service levels have improved"
8776,"Overall, we are moving in the right direction under our new leadership team"
8777,We have leveraged this tough situation this year to build the stronger foundation for growth
8778,"Looking ahead, we anticipate that C-Fresh will deliver modest sales growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the Protein PLUS recall"
8779,"While we expect the beverage business will continue to improve, we will still be operating with less capacity than we had a year ago"
8780,Turning now to Global Biscuits and Snacks
8781,"This division unifies our biscuits and snacks brands across Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen"
8782,The team delivered strong results in the quarter
8783,Sales increased 2% and EBIT was up 14%
8784,The two main drivers of the sales increase were Pepperidge Farm and Arnott’s Biscuit in Asia-Pacific
8785,"First, Pepperidge Farm"
8786,I am pleased with the performance of the team
8787,"Pepperidge Farm snacks continued to deliver strong results, fueled by Goldfish Crackers and Pepperidge Farm Cookies"
8788,"Continued Goldfish growth was driven by larger pack sizes and multi-packs, increased advertising and the continued expansion of our health and well-being offerings, especially Goldfish made with organic wheat"
8789,"In cookies, sales increased across most of the portfolio"
8790,We are pleased with the April launch of our new Farmhouse Cookie brand
8791,These new thin and crispy cookies are simply delicious
8792,"They leverage our baking heritage and are made with simple, real food ingredients"
8793,"It’s early days, but retailer response has been positive with more than 50% ACV distribution"
8794,Consumers have also responded very favorably
8795,"Sales declined slightly in our fresh bakery business, driven by Pepperidge Farms sandwich and swirl bread, coupled with increased spending to counter competitive activity"
8796,Buns and rolls delivered strong growth
8797,Turning to Australia
8798,"In a very challenging trading environment, we delivered sales growth in our biscuit portfolio"
8799,Our new Arnott’s Tim Tam gelato-inspired varieties are performing well with strong customer acceptance and consumer takeaway
8800,"In addition, Arnott’s Shapes continued to regain share with the return to several popular original flavors"
8801,"We are preparing to ship at the end of July new multi-pack single-serve Arnott’s Shapes, Tim Tams and Tiny Teddies in multiple sizes for take-home and on-the-go consumer occasions"
8802,"In addition, our developing markets in Southeast Asia performed well with organic sales growth in both Indonesia and Malaysia"
8803,We are confident that the division will finish the year on a high note as we expect to maintain our current momentum and deliver solid sales growth and double digit operating earnings in the fourth quarter
8804,"In conclusion, our team delivered competitive performance and what continued to be an extraordinarily difficult operating environment"
8805,"However, we clearly have more work to do to address our sales performance"
8806,"Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our plan calls for improved performance to finish the year as we cycle the Bolthouse Farms protein drink recall, last year’s carrot quality issues and a higher adjusted tax rate"
8807,"Additionally, we expect Global Biscuits and Snacks to maintain its current momentum"
8808,We also plan to return to more normal marketing level versus the stepped-up levels of a year ago
8809,"Finally, we are on track to slightly exceed our multi-year $300 million cost savings target by the end of the fiscal, a year earlier than originally planned"
8810,"And as we announced last quarter, we are pursuing incremental cost savings of $150 million over the next few years"
8811,Thank you
8812,And I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes
8813,"With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro"
8814,"Hi, Andrew"
8815,I think that the gross margin expansion that we have achieved has been done with a lot of analytic rigor and has gone after things that really are not hurting the business
8816,And we definitely have kept our investment in advertising consumer and trade around that 24% level and that really hasn’t changed although the mix changes by brand depending upon the competitive situation that it’s in
8817,"With the $300 million, we have been able to save through our effective cost savings program, we have reinvested a significant portion of that back into the business and intend to do so as we go forward in pursuit of the $150 million that we will save"
8818,"When you peel it back, our top line really needs to benefit from the return to growth of Campbell Fresh, which we expect next year and also continued progress to stabilize our V8 beverage business"
8819,Our Global Biscuits and Snacks business has momentum
8820,Condensed is pretty stable
8821,RTS grew nicely and we are under some pressure in broth
8822,So we know what we have to do to get to that growth rate
8823,"Hello, Bryan"
8824,"Right, okay"
8825,"So first of all, in the farms business, we believe that we are getting to stability on that business with significant improvements in quality and customer service"
8826,"And then in the beverage business, by the end of the fourth quarter, we should be in a situation where we can produce enough product to satisfy shelf stock and also promotion merchandising demands from customers"
8827,"Today, we are selling what we make and we can only fulfill shelf stock although that capacity is getting better with the line that we just put into our own plant and then the co-packer will get us back to where we can actually supply"
8828,"We have plans to start to amp up on the beverage business early in fiscal 2018. And we expect, with the right marketing and promotion program with customers, we will continue to see that business growth"
8829,And we are planning on growth for that business next year
8830,"From the profit side, we have invested seriously this year in quality, but yet, we do expect margin expansion from this business for a couple of reasons"
8831,"First of all, as we have delved into the supply chain, we have been able to realize that we have got opportunities for productivity"
8832,"And quite frankly, it’s a significant portion of the $150 million cost savings program that we have talked about before"
8833,"And secondly, we expect margin expansion just from the fact that we will be growing the CPG higher margin business at a faster rate than the lower margin carrot business"
8834,So we should have some margin expansion due to mix shifts
8835,So that’s how we are looking at it at this point
8836,"And of course, we will keep you posted along the way"
8837,"I mean the environment in biscuit continues to be competitive, just like the rest of the environment, but we are very pleased with the performance of our Pepperidge Farm and our Arnott’s business"
8838,I think the competitive situation you are talking about is in the United States
8839,The program that we are running in the biscuit business is we are advertising our brands like Goldfish and Milano
8840,"We have increased innovation in all of our brands and with new innovation in Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies, which we are excited about"
8841,"These cookies are clean label simple ingredients and thinner, crispy"
8842,They just provide a different experience
8843,We have also upgraded our classic cookie line to respond to the fact that the market has moved in terms of quality and we need to maintain that edge
8844,"And then finally, we have a lot of confidence in our direct store delivery network in terms of their ability to merchandise and work the shelf in store"
8845,And we think that combination is serving us well and our business results are proving that out
8846,Yes
8847,"Let me start first with the retailer landscape, which is really competitive and we have got value players and e-commerce putting pressure on more conventional retail grocery and mass channels"
8848,"And in that environment, the amp-up of promotion and also the push on private label continues to be pretty robust"
8849,What we have actually done in terms of our promotional spend is we have spent on broth for the holiday this quarter and we experienced some lower lift
8850,We have increased our support – our promotion support on V8 +Energy because that brand is really gaining a lot of momentum
8851,"And the rest of our promotional spending has been on Global Biscuits and Snacks and particularly in Asia Pacific biscuits, we have a strong promotional program there"
8852,"And then finally, we did hold our in-season soup prices longer than prior year"
8853,"And in an EDLP environment, that actually hits the promotion line"
8854,But I assure you that we are continuing to manage the depth and frequency of our promotional program while we remain competitive and we have to do that
8855,And we will continue to make marketing investments accordingly
8856,"And looking at our categories, most of them have – private label has been pretty much as it always has been, but we did experience an up-tick in soup and in particularly in the broth area"
8857,"Well, suffice it to say that we have always run a multi-channel business and so this isn’t the first time that the retail landscape has morphed, although I have to say that I personally have called the shift to digital and e-commerce a seismic shift"
8858,So we are definitely making longer term plans to address that
8859,"But in the current term, e-commerce is about 4% of food sales and we are setting up resources to address that, but I can assure you that we still have very strong resources against our traditional partners"
8860,"I mean, it’s a great question and we really have to look at the marketing mix by brand and what the brands’ objective is and how they are targeting, because under the A), there has also been a lot of movement away from classic TV and print and into digital, which creates a whole different kind of marketing, content development and a lot of efficiencies there"
8861,And we are still all getting better at how we measure effectiveness
8862,"But I also think in the, A), with the cost savings programs we have been running, we have been doing lots of deep dives into what’s working media, what’s not working media and how do we make sure we are moving more of our dollars to work harder for us"
8863,"So, that’s the high level answer on A"
8864,"Of course, we are watching some of the shift to T, where we have got a very robust revenue management analytics group that supports our marketing and our sales force"
8865,"They are looking at net price realization, because it’s not only list price"
8866,It’s also EDLP
8867,It’s also promoted price points
8868,"And so those vary by brand, but they are all tucked into the T part of ACT"
8869,"And then finally, we are also seeing a bit of an uptick in shopper marketing and that’s involved in that T as well"
8870,"So, again, I think it’s really hard to give you a one-size-fits-all answer, but this is a hypercompetitive marketplace and you have got to be agile in terms of how you run the business to make sure that we are remaining competitive"
8871,And we are proud of the fact that despite the difficult environment we have been able to maintain our market share across 75% of our business
8872,"Hi, Alexia"
8873,"Hello, David"
8874,And I will take the second part
8875,"David, recall that we put a new leadership team into C-Fresh earlier this year and their mandate was to conduct a deep dive strategic review of the business"
8876,And we even retained help to do that so that we make sure that we had a real objective look and we were not talking to ourselves
8877,"And so this team did an exhaustive review of the categories, the opportunities, the potential for the business as we have got our capacity back up"
8878,We looked at both the CPG businesses
8879,We have really looked at the beverage business and then we also looked at the farms business
8880,And they came back confirming the potential of the business to deliver growth in excess of our long-term targets and at multiples of center-store categories
8881,So we will be running that play
8882,That is a 3-year strategic plan that they created and that will go into the next year’s operating plan
8883,"So we really took this opportunity in a tough situation to go all the way back to go and say, what did we assume when we bought this business and are those assumptions still valid, and how do you see the potential of this business"
8884,"And quite frankly, with the consumers’ shifts to fresh, we think that going forward we are going to be in good position to capitalize on that shift"
8885,Yes
8886,You look – we run three different kinds of supply chain here
8887,We run a warehouse supply chain
8888,We run a fresh supply chain
8889,"And then in Pepperidge Farm, as you indicate, we run an independent distribution system through DSD"
8890,These distributors are entrepreneurs and they have built a great business
8891,"In the snacks business, you do see a portion of the business in warehouse snacks, but you also see a large portion of the snacks business, whether it be sweet, savory or salty in DSD"
8892,So we still believe in the model for this category and the operations part of it calls for a very focused category distribution
8893,That’s where you can get the maximum effectiveness and efficiency
8894,"In fact, we have two separate DSD networks, one for bakery and one for snacks, because of that reason"
8895,And we do believe that DSD also helps with the quality of the product and making sure that we are working the shelves every day
8896,"The fresh bakery, we have been under pressure with Swirl bread and sandwich bread"
8897,We have now increased the quality and reformulated our Swirl bread and we are out with new sandwich bread offerings
8898,So we believe we have responded to that
8899,And our buns and roll business seem – continues to be really robust and we will be continuing to push that one
8900,So bakery was down slightly
8901,Yes
8902,"Just to specifically answer your question in shakedowns, we actually have shakedowns in a couple of the school systems in the country"
8903,We have moved those more out of retail and into working with schools to give kids healthier snacks
8904,"In terms of the new management team coming in, their first and foremost objective is now that we have got our quality and our customer service back is to make sure that we are shoring up our business with customers and making sure customers are happy"
8905,"In addition to that, we will innovate some things in carrots"
8906,"For example, one of the things they have are rainbow carrots where we have been able to grow different colored carrots"
8907,"So, we are working with those in a few retailers"
8908,But I think suffice it to say that most of the innovation will happen in the CPG business
8909,"That’s where we really are pushing innovation, but we will do enough in carrots to make sure that we are keeping that business stable to modestly growing"
8910,I am not sure I understood your question
8911,What business were you talking about?
8912,"I think the refrigerated beverage business is very competitive and we have seen – the advent of ultra-premium juice, the fermented juices coming or fermented beverages coming in, but we do believe we have a great product and we have a range of across super premium and premium juice"
8913,"We have been again strapped, because we haven’t had the supply and the capacity to meet that increased demand"
8914,"So next year, we will be running a full play"
8915,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone"
8916,I'm pleased that in the second quarter we delivered our financial targets
8917,"Our sales grew solidly, up 5% in constant currency"
8918,It was a meaningful acceleration from the first three months
8919,"In constant currency, our adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 5%, reflecting strong growth in high profit channels and disciplined expense management coupled with phased growth leverage"
8920,"During the quarter, we enhanced many important strategic growth levers which created positive momentum across our diversified business in our brands, channels, geographies and categories"
8921,"These gains were fueled by strong strides in our innovation, social media and digital engagement"
8922,"We continue to make priority investments through our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which is proceeding according to plan"
8923,I will elaborate on each of these in a moment
8924,Our two biggest challenges currently are the brick-and-mortar business in U.S
8925,"mid-tier department stores, which continues to be impacted by soft traffic and a slowdown in consumer purchasing in the Middle East"
8926,"Additionally, Hong Kong continued to be soft, and we remain cautious about the impact of political issues and terrorism affecting our business in certain markets"
8927,We also continued to be penalized by the strength of the U.S
8928,dollar
8929,"Despite these headwinds, we continue to successfully activate many of the elements of our strategy, which give us confidence in the strength and sustainability of our business growth"
8930,"The first successful element of our strategy is the positive momentum of our diverse brand portfolio, and we continuously build from this strategic advantage"
8931,"In the quarter, our best performers were our mid-sized and luxury brands, which continue to gain devoted consumers and strengthen their desirable product offering and services"
8932,They are headed on a path to become big brands
8933,"Tom Ford, La Mer, Jo Malone, Darphin and the brands we acquired in the past few years generated impressive constant currency double digit growth globally"
8934,"Tom Ford products were particularly well received, and the brand grew in every category in every region"
8935,Two of our big brands generated improved sales and grew globally in constant currency
8936,The Estée Lauder brand sales increased mid-single digits with positive growth both in skin care and makeup
8937,Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ was the largest U.S
8938,skin care launch in calendar 2015 according to NPD
8939,The brands' makeup sales increased in every region and globally were up double digits led by foundations and lip products
8940,"Estée Lauder brand grew in every region, which included an acceleration in China and in travel retail"
8941,Makeup fueled growth in the UK where the brand has a high makeup penetration
8942,"global business also grew in constant currency, as we had anticipated"
8943,The brand international business further accelerated with double digit gains in most market as well as in travel retail
8944,In the U.S
8945,"sales showed improvement versus the first quarter, but still declined, due primarily to weak traffic in brick-and-mortar mid-tier department store and its tourist-focused freestanding stores"
8946,We expect M•A•C
8947,"international sales to increase further in the second half of the fiscal year with continued rapid online growth, creative innovation, expanded consumer coverage in overseas markets including launching in new cities, improved merchandise in store and accelerating its successful efforts in social media"
8948,Our aim is to strengthen the brand competitiveness in the U.S
8949,while investing behind its international momentum
8950,"We also strengthened our portfolio with the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, two of the fastest growing prestige makeup brands"
8951,"With a strong millennial following, they extended our presence in specialty-multi retail, which is one of the fastest growing channels for prestige beauty"
8952,"Too Faced joined our company in mid-December, just as it was introducing its Sweet Peach collection, which became its most successful launch ever"
8953,"The collection attracted nearly 100,000 consumers online who waited up to four hours to make a purchase"
8954,"We were excited about the prospect of maximizing the potential of BECCA and Too Faced forward, as we are doing with our other new brands"
8955,The other acquisitions we made over the last two years are growing rapidly
8956,We continue to integrate them into the company while we expand their consumer coverage and offerings
8957,"As an example, we launched Le Labo in Nordstrom and created a new fragrance set, which were popular gifts and best sellers online"
8958,Our important strategy of diversifying our distribution to expand our consumer coverage is progressing well
8959,We are evolving the company distribution footprint to meet consumers' changing shopping patterns
8960,We are accelerating the execution of the strategy as some U.S
8961,"department stores closed unproductive doors while our most profitable channels delivered outstanding performances, including specialty-multi retail, travel retail and online, all of which rose double digits in the quarter"
8962,"We have deep experience successfully managing our business across a wide variety of distribution channels, for example in the UK and in many European countries"
8963,"In a fast-growing specialty-multi retail channel, we are increasing our presence by launching more brands globally to reach new consumers"
8964,"In the quarter, we launched Estée Lauder initially in 30 ULTA stories in the U.S"
8965,and on ULTA
8966,com and had very strong results
8967,Clinique's expansion in the channel included more than 50 new doors with Sephora in JCPenney where it was the number one skin care brand in those doors
8968,Outside the U.S
8969,", Clinique launched in the largest specialty-multi retailer in Korea"
8970,"In travel retail, our strategy to make our limited distribution brands more widely available and offer a broader portfolio of brands in the channel has yielded outstanding results"
8971,"We have broadened our makeup offerings in travel retail to capture growing demand while Jo Malone growth has helped drive a reinvigorated fragrance business, and we are introducing some of our newer artisanal fragrance brands to airport locations"
8972,"Our retail sales growth was more than double the 8% passenger traffic growth in the channel, as more than half of our top 30 travel retail markets posted double digit gains"
8973,"However, it bears mentioning that travel retail remains volatile, as political issues as well currency fluctuation can cause significant changes in travel patterns"
8974,"We continue to execute on our e-commerce strategy, which deliver accelerating double digit growth in the quarter, as we supported our own sites and retailer sites with new programs and innovation"
8975,"Our sales were strong across brand sites, led by M•A•C, as well as retailers and third-party sites"
8976,Traffic in orders rose strong double digits compared to last year
8977,"We opened our – or launched an approximately 100 new sites globally for our brands and products, and began selling online for the first time in Hong Kong, the Middle East, and the Balkans"
8978,"In North America, several brands had record-breaking online sales during holidays, including Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins and Aveda"
8979,"We continue to focus on mobile engagement and saw significant growth in traffic, which drove m-commerce sales increase of 75% over the Thanksgiving Cyber Monday weekend"
8980,Our brands on retailers' site also posted double digit growth in the quarter
8981,"Our online business was exceptionally strong in China, where sales nearly doubled, thanks to a highly successful single day on Tmall"
8982,"During that event on November 11, sales of our six brand stores on Tmall were twice that of previous year"
8983,"At Estée Lauder, most of the consumers who purchased products that day were new to the brand on Tmall, illustrating the success of our strategy to reach new consumer through different channels"
8984,"From a geographic standpoint, two of the largest markets we had expected to improve this quarter did so"
8985,"Our business in France showed solid growth, and our U.S"
8986,"sales improved, led by our high-end fragrance brands, which were big winners at holidays"
8987,Estée Lauder's Blockbuster Set helped drive traffic and sold out weeks before Christmas
8988,"Our sales in China were strong, with many of our brands rising double digits"
8989,"La Mer was a standout, driven by the successful launch of its Renewal Oil and Skin Color Collection, a key entry in the fast-growing area that bridges skin care and makeup"
8990,"The Skin Color line is at the incremental sales, and having a positive halo effect on the brands' skin care business"
8991,"Makeup continue to be fast-growing category in China, and we are responding to the demand"
8992,"M•A•C's growth in China was outstanding, as lipstick sales rose strongly"
8993,"The brand's upcoming launch on Tmall is expected to further drive sales, particularly in cities without brick-and-mortar"
8994,We expect Estée Lauder brands' momentum in China to continue
8995,"In our third quarter, we plan to launch its best-selling Double Wear Foundation in a cash room compact, (12:51) a package innovation that is coveted by Chinese consumers"
8996,Looking at our categories now
8997,Our three major ones are growing solidly on a constant currency basis
8998,"Skin care returned to growth, and we have created a new profile growth engine with a fragrance category, with our now extensive portfolio of high-end fragrances, which includes Jo Malone, Tom Ford, AERIN at Zegna Sensa, (13:20) as well as newer brands such as Kilian, Frédéric Mall, and Le Labo"
8999,They had growth of nearly 30% during the quarter
9000,These luxury fragrance brands were primarily powered by strong new fragrance launches and social media
9001,"In addition, innovation is driving our success across multiple engines of growth, expanding our brands, regions, channels, and target consumer groups"
9002,"We are leveraging opportunities across the largest, fastest-growing subcategories in areas of consumer benefits while creating a leading new breakthroughs"
9003,We are increasing our speed to market and creating more superior products
9004,"Additionally, our research and development team continues to develop new proprietary technology platform, and our innovative concept extend beyond product to also include packaging, delivery systems, merchandising, services, and even new approaches to digital engagement"
9005,One of our numerous products in packaging innovations is Clinique's Fresh Pressed Daily Booster
9006,"Launching this month, the Booster represents a new subcategory for our company"
9007,The product concentrated vitamin C is intended to be freshly pressed into our moisturizer to immediately brighten and even skin tone
9008,"Fresh Pressed should also increase sales of Clinique core moisturizer business, since they are used together"
9009,"Our brands are also focusing innovation around hero products and hero franchises, creating new offerings around a core collection is very efficient, and draws renewed attention to the brand priorities"
9010,"For example, Estée Lauder recently introduced new products to reinforce its two biggest franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, and it paid off, as both grew double digits"
9011,", sales of the core Advanced Night Repair Serum rose 17%, boosted by its innovative Intensive Recovery Ampoules"
9012,And a new eye mask that just launched last month as part of the franchise should further lift the serum and the entire collection
9013,I'm proud that several of these products are being recognized for their innovation
9014,"Last month, Estée Lauder received Marie Claire's prestigious Prix d'Excellence Award in research and development for three products: Advanced Night Repair Powerfoil Mask, Advanced Night Repair Ampoules, and Revitalizing Supreme+"
9015,This award honors the most Innovative products of the year
9016,"Our innovation is helped by our brands' and retailers' websites, which play a key role as a marketing vehicle to raise awareness of our new products"
9017,Millions of people can research the latest launches and read ratings and reviews before purchasing
9018,"We will continue to invest in capabilities to further expand our presence online, and our brands are making important strides to stay on the cutting edge of social media, which continues to strongly influence beauty choices"
9019,"As an example, in the last years, M•A•C has significantly increased its digital engagement"
9020,The number of global Instagram followers of M•A•C has increased by 75% to 40 million and its number of global Facebook fans has climbed sharply
9021,"M•A•C has launched local Instagram's account in several markets including Brazil, Germany and Russia and the content is shoppable"
9022,"M•A•C's global makeup artists are engaging consumers with locally relevant content, as the brand is using more influencers a user generated cost to augment its messaging"
9023,We just announced a collaboration with 10 global beauty influencers and bloggers who will create their own M•A•C lipsticks
9024,Our brands' actions to drive earned media value through influencers is working well a win made (17:58) gains in all product categories
9025,"As a company, we have tied to the number one position in earned media value share in Total Beauty is measured by Tribe Dynamics, which quantifies the value of digital content created by third parties about a brand"
9026,We have the largest corporate share in skin care and fragrances and we have tied for first in makeup
9027,"We have Tom Ford, Smashbox and now Too Faced a strongly growing share of engagement with influencers, which is reflected in the higher shares in prestige beauty"
9028,"In the second quarter M•A•C strongly increased its social influencer engagement, which led to a 30% rise in earned media value"
9029,"And in another impressive achievement in China, the Estée Lauder brand was ranked number one and the only genius brand in the recent L2 China Beauty Index, which cited the brand leadership in digital marketing, mobile and social media"
9030,Now let me turn to outlook
9031,We expect to achieve constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017. This includes approximately 1% of incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of Too Faced
9032,We continue to expect our sales and profits to accelerate in the second half
9033,"The stronger gains are expected to come from four main factors, including organic growth, regular price increases that took effect in January, increased consumer coverage tailored by brand and contribution from the recently acquired brands"
9034,"There are certain brands, channels in countries that we believe will be superior growth engines"
9035,"They include our luxury brands and the online, travel retail and specialty-multi channels"
9036,"By market, we expect China to remain strong and Hong Kong should start stabilizing"
9037,"As we capitalize on the best growth prospects, we are also managing costs and reallocating resources from lower growth area to priority ones, aided by Leading Beauty Forward"
9038,We continue to hire talent where we need skill sets and investing capabilities that will position us to win in the fast moving competitive world of global prestige beauty for the long-term
9039,"With a diversified business that's directed by proven strategy and powered by multiple engines of growth, which we have strengthened even further with our artisanal fragrances and our recent acquisition of fast-growing makeup brands, we are confident in our long-term outlook"
9040,Our results will continue to be fueled by the best brand portfolio and the best people in the industry which will drive our winning strategy and continue our leadership in global prestige beauty
9041,Now I will turn the call over to Tracey
9042,Good morning
9043,"Yeah, and just to add one aspect (33:51) that, beyond reducing cost and doing of what Tracey is explained, I believe one of the key benefits in the next two, three years of Leading Beauty Forward, to reallocate resources to the fast-growing opportunity and the fast-growing businesses that we have around the world"
9044,"So this should further enforce our strengths, on top of creating more cost saving and more margin over the long-term"
9045,"And I just would like to add one thing on the top-line, which is – yeah, 4% to 5% organic plus acquisition is what we see today"
9046,"And actually, all what we are doing in terms of action is to improve the ability of all of these elements to grow faster in the future"
9047,"Meaning the organic is – the good news, there are so many very strong drivers of growth within the current organic travel retail"
9048,"China gains, stabilization of Hong Kong, continue of online, and they're all accretive in term of margin"
9049,"So the organic, with the activity that we are doing and with actually – with the decrease of the department store in the U.S"
9050,", which is, at this point, the most disappointing performance as part of our portfolio, this part is decreasing as a percentage of business"
9051,What is increasing as a percentage of business are all the fast-growing channels and fast-growing activity
9052,"So the 4% to 5% can become stronger over time and not weaker, plus the acquisition"
9053,Now the acquisitions are doing fantastic
9054,"We acquired great brands, both this concept of artisanal high-end fragrances, which as I said in my prepared remarks, altogether growing more than 30% and the new acquisitions like Too Faced, the BECCA which have high growth brand into high growth channels"
9055,So the mix of improving our organics with a new change of mix and adapting to the new reality and the strong acquisition actually aims to reinforce our growth potential rather than dilute it
9056,"So, no, I frankly disagree that over what's happening on M•A•C is out of our control"
9057,"There are two things which is happening on M•A•C One, which is a soft traffic in the distribution where M•A•C is present and we need to correct that over time"
9058,And so it's kind of in our control
9059,We can correct that
9060,"And second, if M•A•C had to make improvements in the social media activity penetration and we are making these improvements"
9061,And this is in our control and it's an area that we could do better
9062,We are doing better as I explained and we'll continue to do even better
9063,And the third part is marketing programs
9064,"M•A•C quality of collection, quality of innovation will need to improve and continue to improve in the U.S"
9065,and we are working on it and some of the things have been already visible in quarter two and more to come in the next quarter
9066,"So it's not only a distribution adjustment, it's also a consumer engagement opportunity and also an innovation programs opportunities and we are addressing all of these three"
9067,"Then I want to add that on M•A•C we are also working on new freestanding store formats that will address the ability to have freestanding store also in lower productivity situation while low tourist traffic because they will be smaller, more connected online, more engaging for consumers and more profitable"
9068,"And the only thing I would like to add is that in a moment of evolution where consumers are really sensitive to innovation and to trying new products, one of the area of promotion where we are investing more is sampling"
9069,"And we really are learning more and more how to make samplings very effective, also models that we call paid samplings which are very effective way to do sampling"
9070,So we are increasing sampling
9071,"And thanks to this, we are increasing the trial level of our new innovations"
9072,I will – let me start from the growth
9073,So we see the market 4% to 5%
9074,"Our goal – our, say, high-end goal has always been to grow at least 1 point more than market, meaning to continue growing market share"
9075,And we are delivering that and we believe we'll continue to deliver that in the long-term
9076,Now to explain the detail of what happened
9077,"In reality, we are taking the estimate down 1%"
9078,"That's what's happening, and we are obviously still deliver 6% to 7% thanks to Too Faced"
9079,But there is 1% less expected growth than there were before Too Faced
9080,Now where this comes from and why we believe will accelerate in the second half
9081,This comes from mid-tier department stores in the U.S
9082,"that did less than what we expected originally and comes from the Middle East, emerging markets mainly"
9083,"Middle East, that was really tough, and Turkey"
9084,Turkey was a super high growth market for us and a very unfortunate event of the quarter two make Turkey grow much less than what we were expecting
9085,And so this is what was the 1% less
9086,"But on the other side, there were many things that continue to do well actually that did even better than what we expected"
9087,"So for example, the improvements in Asia particularly in China are even better than expected"
9088,The trend stabilization of Hong Kong is very good news
9089,"The continued success of Korea is really amazing, and this has huge implication for travel retail"
9090,"Frankly, the super high growth of travel retail, which show how our strategy is working is even better than what we could have anticipated"
9091,And the online continue to be very strong
9092,"So at the end, the net of this is that many of our engines of growth are getting better and better"
9093,"Two of the things that took us down in the past, Middle East and Hong Kong are stabilizing, and the issue remains mid-tier department store U.S"
9094,"where we do not anticipate a lot of improvements in this quarter, and that's what is the result"
9095,"Of our estimate, you need to add to this that our acquisitions are very strong and they could do very well and even better, and so that's the other element of strength that we are adding to the second semester in our ability to deliver our goals"
9096,"Now, Tracey, on the EPS?"
9097,"So probably I could (52:06) start and say our absolute advertising spending is going to be more or less stable across the year and will be – is assumed to be a bit stronger actually in the second six months, so in the six months we have in front of us, particularly in the third quarter because of innovation launches and activities"
9098,"In terms of percentage of sales, so we'll slightly down in the year and this percentage is driven also by mix, meaning our advertised – or more advertised brands, I should say our traditionally advertised brands are becoming a lower percentage of our total business and our brands which are supported by different tools from social media to sampling and to others like in store activities are becoming a bigger percentage of the business"
9099,"Because of that, you should assume an overall stability for the next months of our absolute investment, and a slight reduction of percentage of sales"
9100,"In gross margin, Tracey, you want to comment on that?"
9101,"So on the first question, the answer is yes"
9102,The evolution of our channel mix is accretive
9103,"But not only to margin, it's also accretive to growth potential, because we are swinging a bigger percentage of our business into higher growth channels, from what we see"
9104,So there is a positive margin and positive growth
9105,"And to your point, to your second question, I think – I believe I already explained"
9106,The key thing is that the key area of acceleration are pricing
9107,"We had pricing in January, which had about 2 points of acceleration"
9108,"We had a lot of new – particularly for new brands – new distribution opportunities which are planned to start being impacting the business in the second semester, and there are 2, 3 points that will come out of new distribution"
9109,"And this new distribution, I do mean – new distribution, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone in new countries, new cities"
9110,"So it's not cannibalizing distribution, it's really coverage of consumer"
9111,That's why we call it consumer coverage opportunities
9112,"Plus, this includes some of the mix acceleration, meaning the moment Estée Lauder brand successfully built doors in ULTA, and they were very well, these automatically create more distribution which grows better"
9113,So there is more of this in the second semester
9114,"Then there is strong organic growth, the innovation that is working, as we have explained our prepared remark, will now continue to impact and grow in multiple areas"
9115,"I believe the good news is that skin care is growing again and is adding this engine – and the other good news is that the engine we just created with these fragrances – high-end fragrances – continue to grow (57:51) very well, and we continue to accelerate growth on a higher base"
9116,"Plus, as I explained, Middle East and Hong Kong , they've been two negatives in the first six months, should be better in the second six months"
9117,"And finally, the base is lower, frankly, particularly in quarter four"
9118,"The base is lower, and so we believe that the combination of these things will bring our organic growth to the level that we are estimating"
9119,"On top of that, the new acquisitions, Too Faced and BECCA, are doing very well, so – and we believe they will add the very significant sense of comfort to the ability to deliver the right growth, and by the way, this will continue into next fiscal year"
9120,"And going back to the first part of the question is, yeah, we came at the low end of the guidance, but the guidance has a high end and a low end, so I would now conclude is that we have issues forecasting"
9121,The issue is the one I explained
9122,The issue is that versus our competition
9123,We are absolutely overexposed to mid-tier department stores in the U.S
9124,particularly
9125,And this very high exposure and we have been obviously hit harder than others on the soft traffic that this channel has experienced in the last year
9126,And that's why we are trying to react to
9127,"We are trying to continue to diversify our business globally in order to be able not to be over-dependent by any channel, any country, any brand"
9128,And to have such a well diversified portfolio that we can deliver our 1 point ahead of market or more growth independently from any other area of the business or any specific area of the business
9129,"So frankly I'm very proud how we are pivoting the company in terms of online, TR, specialty-multi distribution, how we are pivoting the company in terms of social media versus historical or traditional way to engage the consumers, how we are pivoting the company to penetrate the makeup boom in a very aggressive way, how we are pivoting the company to split up and change our innovation models"
9130,We are pivoting and we are pivoting while continue to be one of the fastest growth companies in the consumer industry
9131,I personally am very proud of my team in the way we are managing this
9132,although we do recognize that we were at the low end of our estimate and we are overexposed to the soft and usual mid-tier department store in the U.S
9133,"Good morning, everybody"
9134,Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first nine months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months
9135,"As we expected, our earnings growth is accelerating as we move through the second half of the year"
9136,"We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail, and in August, our board of directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend by 8.2%, and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years"
9137,Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth
9138,"In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7%, adjusted operating company's income growth, a strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines"
9139,"For the first nine months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%"
9140,"Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day"
9141,We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment
9142,Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long-term
9143,"As you know, we view momentum has continued strength across various brand metrics including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share"
9144,"Marlboro continues to have category-leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable"
9145,"As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 share point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first nine months to 43.4%"
9146,So let's look at what's happening here beginning with California
9147,"As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2-per-pack SCT increase to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half and that's continuing to happen"
9148,"You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SCT increase"
9149,"Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch"
9150,"In fact, there have been five such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them"
9151,"Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro, the share leader"
9152,"Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines"
9153,"First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California"
9154,These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions
9155,"For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability Marlboro brings to their stores"
9156,"In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position"
9157,"Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro Black label in California and Washington state"
9158,"Marlboro Black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, its exclusive soft touch technology"
9159,We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro's share while staying on strategy to maximize income
9160,Look for more product news from PM USA at our Investor Day next week
9161,Moving to the smokeless product segment
9162,USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume
9163,The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first nine months of 2017. Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2% to 33.9% in the third quarter and by 0.6% for the first nine months to 33.6%
9164,"On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter and 0.9 share points for the first nine months driven by Skoal declines"
9165,These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining its Skoal investments to enhance its profitability
9166,"In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth"
9167,MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels
9168,"And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter"
9169,"In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for IQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day"
9170,Another focus of our Investor Day will be the regulatory environment
9171,"As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S"
9172,tobacco and nicotine regulation
9173,FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes
9174,"We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk"
9175,"We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence"
9176,"Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness"
9177,"And we further support Commissioner Gottlieb's direction to the Center for Tobacco Products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive"
9178,"Finally, FDA also stated its intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine; a possibility since the act became law in 2009, and for which PM USA has been preparing"
9179,"As the FDA itself acknowledged, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement, and again we'll say more about all this next week"
9180,"In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging nine months"
9181,"Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full-year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth"
9182,And here's Billy for more detail on our performance
9183,Hi Chris
9184,"Good questions, both"
9185,"So we've discussed previously, Chris, that elasticities with respect to cigarettes and we've had big jolts before like the one that we've experienced in California"
9186,"And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption and you get a deep decline, and then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3. So a lot of it depends on how big the shock is California $2 a pack, after not having had an increase for decades, really"
9187,So it's coming back
9188,We expect it will come back to where it is on the curve and we see some improvement there
9189,But it's going to take some time
9190,It was a big shock to the system
9191,"And you see that in the numbers, I think"
9192,"So on Marlboro, we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline"
9193,You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market where we think that there's a niche where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive smokers
9194,"We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward, and so we're going to talk about this next week"
9195,"And I mentioned, I think, Black label already in the remarks"
9196,"I won't comment too specifically, Chris"
9197,But I think we've called out several areas before
9198,"We are building a very, very strong competitive advantage in digital marketing and we continue to invest there"
9199,We continue to invest in the equity behind our brands
9200,"And obviously, as the FDA has now set the new direction with respect to reduced-risk products, you have to make investments there in order to compete effectively"
9201,And those are some areas that we obviously have been investing in and expect to invest further
9202,Thanks for calling
9203,"Hi, Vivien"
9204,"I guess the only thing I'd add to that, Vivien, has been that the wholesalers have strategies around when they build their inventory in, when they decide to take their inventory down, which they're free, of course, to do"
9205,So I'm glad we're going to see you next week and we are going to talk about Marlboro in some detail there
9206,"I think what we would say is you have to assess it in the context of the strategy, which is to maximize income"
9207,"And so when we look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level, despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that; we don't do it for competitive reasons"
9208,"But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been"
9209,It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain
9210,"And you can see in the first nine months, we've given back about 0.3 share points"
9211,So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward
9212,It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing
9213,"There were all these competitive launches and then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is – because of industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them"
9214,So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands – that's a market dynamic change
9215,"But, overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance"
9216,So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week
9217,We just don't break it down sort of at the level that you're asking
9218,I hope you can appreciate that
9219,Thanks for calling
9220,0.3 share points
9221,"So I think one of the principal contributors at the cost line was, remember in the year-ago comp, we had California ballot spending, Adam"
9222,And that came out obviously in the comp and that was a significant delta in the year-over-year comp
9223,I would say that the competition in the smokeless side of the business is competitive
9224,We obviously are doing great with Copenhagen
9225,"You know our strategy on Copenhagen and Skoal but we have a competitor that's got a brand there, and there were significant promotions in the quarter"
9226,I think that accounts for it as well
9227,Thanks for your call
9228,(22:23) Unknown Speaker Thank you
9229,So I have a question on the competitive activity that you're seeing in combustibles
9230,"Greatly appreciate the color on the call thus far, but digging a little bit deeper in terms of the increased competitor spending"
9231,Has it primarily been related to these new launches or is it behind the core flagship brands and how do you expect some of those competitive dynamics to persist over the next few quarters?
9232,"Sure, let me see if I can help you"
9233,"I think the answer is, there was quite a lot of activity around new product launches"
9234,"So we mentioned in our remarks, we've got, I think, five of them over the course of the year, which is higher than we typically see"
9235,"It's also worth mentioning that it's just not five, there are multiple SKUs with the five, so you actually have a lot of SKUs coming into the marketplace"
9236,"And as you know, in our category, because of the way we have marketing restrictions is the battle is at retail"
9237,"People put promotional resources on them, including us, when we do this, to try to promote trial"
9238,"And when you have smokers who are trying a new product, it puts pressure on the share leader on Marlboro"
9239,"So that's our diagnosis of what's been happening; that and California, obviously"
9240,And then a follow-up on MarkTen
9241,"So the results were pretty positive this quarter, with volume growing more than 50%"
9242,"So what are your expectations this year for e-vapor category growth? Clearly, it's accelerated a little bit this year versus what we've seen over the past couple of years and what are the plans behind further investment behind the MarkTen franchise?"
9243,"So on your last question, I'd invite you – either Judy will let you come to the Investor Day or you can certainly dial in, we're going to have a lot to say about our vapor business on Investment Day, and we've got exciting plans there"
9244,"Look, the category has picked back up, as you say"
9245,"The last number I saw, I think it looks like it's picked up maybe about 8% on a volume basis, higher on a dollar basis because you've got devices obviously which contribute to the dollar sales there"
9246,"So as the technology gets better in vapor and those products become more acceptable to the consumer, we continue to see high trial and there is some stickiness as the products get better"
9247,So I think that's one of our key platforms for our innovative products and we're excited about the chance to continue to grow that business
9248,Thanks for calling
9249,"Hi, Michael"
9250,Sure
9251,"First of all, I think the timelines that you called out are correct, and those haven't changed since our last discussion on that"
9252,"And as you point out, they are nominal, to use that word, I guess, at the FDA"
9253,"But I think that they're working hard on it; those are PMI applications, of course, it's assisted by us so you may want to speak to them as well about it"
9254,"But we've been encouraged by the degree of interchange on those applications and I think maybe another milestone to be watching for is if there were to be a TPSAC hearing on the applications, Michael, which as you know, is part of the process"
9255,"And so PMI, with our assistance, is getting ready for all those things and we are working really hard to be ready so that when that authorization comes, as we hope it does, that we can get to market quickly"
9256,But I think your understanding of the process is correct and I don't really have anything new to add except perhaps the possibility of a TPSAC hearing should they announce one
9257,"Hi, Matt"
9258,"No, we haven't"
9259,"Although we're following it closely, because obviously we've been following other people's reporting on that"
9260,And we've been following the C-store dynamics
9261,"It just hasn't shown up in our category, Matt"
9262,Thanks for calling
9263,"Hi, Bonnie"
9264,Sure
9265,So this is another topic that we're going to cover in some detail next week
9266,"So I don't want to put you off on your question but I'll give you a high-level sort of a lead-in, if you will"
9267,"There's quite a lot to do, obviously, as you know of any nicotine standard or any other standard, for that matter"
9268,"Wherever to be implemented, there has to be science and evidence-based, and in the nicotine area there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance"
9269,"So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, including the question of whether compensation would occur, because you obviously, from a public health point of view, wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine"
9270,There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be or where it should be measured – is it in the aerosol or is it in the filler? How would it be implemented? Would it phased in over time or would it be done on a more immediate basis? Those are questions which have to be answered that are not answered yet; and the government has research going on that regard
9271,"As you might expect, our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research as well as doing our own research so that we're fully informed on those"
9272,"There are big questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about"
9273,"Now, the possibility of a standard around nicotine has been in the statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might meet any potential standard"
9274,"You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco leaf treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies; most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them, but I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this"
9275,"And then finally, I think another area that's going to have to be wrestled with is what about unintended consequences if a standard comes in? We're going to have to make sure that the market still works"
9276,"So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled to ground and again we'll talk more about that next week"
9277,We're looking forward to seeing you
9278,We tried to share that with you on a yearly basis
9279,"I think you'll remember, typically at CAGNY, we put up the equity scores"
9280,We do an equity study every year
9281,"I believe the last chart we put up, we called out that Marlboro's equity is at least 14 points higher than the next closest competitor, off of an already high base, and that Marlboro's equity has been improving over time"
9282,"So that work is underway again, and as soon as we have an update to the equity study, I assume that we'll be updating you in due course"
9283,"But its equity remains strong, there's no question about it, and you'll see it in the premium price it's able to command"
9284,"Hey, Nik"
9285,"Yeah, we're going to talk about Nat Sherman next week"
9286,"Just for precision, we acquired it in January of this year, so it hasn't been quite a year"
9287,"I think we just talked about before what we've been doing is getting the product ready, getting the package ready"
9288,"It's a huge whitespace opportunity for us as you know, Nik, and we've got plans to get that in distribution, and I think it's going to – I think you'll be interested to see what we have on Nat Sherman"
9289,"For IQOS, well, for sure, when we launch IQOS, it's going to have a lower margin because we're going to be investing in it"
9290,"But the idea, over time is, is that when you get to scale obviously, that you could have a nice margin business in IQOS"
9291,So we're working through all that
9292,We're going to talk about IQOS in some significant detail as well next week
9293,"The answer is yes, Nik"
9294,"I think it's a very insightful question, and in fact, our sales team has been working on that project and others"
9295,"I think as personalization becomes more important to the consumer and particularly with the analytical tools and the data sets that we now have that – take revenue growth management tools, for example, which we've deployed already in the smokeless business and are rolling it out across the rest of the businesses, it allows you the precision to do just that"
9296,It's an excellent question and we're working on it
9297,"Okay, I look forward to it"
